30388456,2018,Cell,Defining T Cell States Associated with Response to Checkpoint Immunotherapy in Melanoma.,"Treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Despite the high rate of response in advanced melanoma, the majority of patients succumb to disease. To identify factors associated with success or failure of checkpoint therapy, we profiled transcriptomes of 16,291 individual immune cells from 48 tumor samples of melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors.

30388455,2018,Cell,A Cancer Cell Program Promotes T Cell Exclusion and Resistance to Checkpoint Blockade.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 33 melanoma tumors and computational analyses to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T cell exclusion and immune evasion. The program is expressed prior to immunotherapy, characterizes cold niches in situ, and predicts clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in an independent cohort of 112 melanoma patients. CDK4/6-inhibition represses this program in individual malignant cells, induces senescence, and reduces melanoma tumor outgrowth in mouse models in vivo when given in combination with immunotherapy. Our study provides a high-resolution landscape of ICI-resistant cell states, identifies clinically predictive signatures, and suggests new therapeutic strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance.","Jerby-Arnon, Livnat;Shah, Parin;Cuoco, Michael S;Rodman, Christopher;Su, Mei-Ju;Melms, Johannes C;Leeson, Rachel;Kanodia, Abhay;Mei, Shaolin;Lin, Jia-Ren;Wang, Shu;Rabasha, Bokang;Liu, David;Zhang, Gao;Margolais, Claire;Ashenberg, Orr;Ott, Patrick A;Buchbinder, Elizabeth I;Haq, Rizwan;Hodi, F Stephen;Boland, Genevieve M;Sullivan, Ryan J;Frederick, Dennie T;Miao, Benchun;Moll, Tabea;Flaherty, Keith T;Herlyn, Meenhard;Jenkins, Russell W;Thummalapalli, Rohit;Kowalczyk, Monika S;Cañadas, Israel;Schilling, Bastian;Cartwright, Adam N R;Luoma, Adrienne M;Malu, Shruti;Hwu, Patrick;Bernatchez, Chantale;Forget, Marie-Andrée;Barbie, David A;Shalek, Alex K;Tirosh, Itay;Sorger, Peter K;Wucherpfennig, Kai;Van Allen, Eliezer M;Schadendorf, Dirk;Johnson, Bruce E;Rotem, Asaf;Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit;Garraway, Levi A;Yoon, Charles H;Izar, Benjamin;Regev, Aviv"
30343900,2018,Cell,High-Dimensional Analysis Delineates Myeloid and Lymphoid Compartment Remodeling during Successful Immune-Checkpoint Cancer Therapy.,"Although current immune-checkpoint therapy (ICT) mainly targets lymphoid cells, it is associated with a broader remodeling of the tumor micro-environment. Here, using complementary forms of high-dimensional profiling, we define differences across all hematopoietic cells from syngeneic mouse tumors during unrestrained tumor growth or effective ICT. Unbiased assessment of gene expression of tumor-infiltrating cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and longitudinal assessment of cellular protein expression by mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed significant remodeling of both the lymphoid and myeloid intratumoral compartments. Surprisingly, we observed multiple subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages, distinguishable by the markers CD206, CX3CR1, CD1d, and iNOS, that change over time during ICT in a manner partially dependent on IFNγ. Our data support the hypothesis that this macrophage polarization/activation results from effects on circulatory monocytes and early macrophages entering tumors, rather than on pre-polarized mature intratumoral macrophages.","Gubin, Matthew M;Esaulova, Ekaterina;Ward, Jeffrey P;Malkova, Olga N;Runci, Daniele;Wong, Pamela;Noguchi, Takuro;Arthur, Cora D;Meng, Wei;Alspach, Elise;Medrano, Ruan F V;Fronick, Catrina;Fehlings, Michael;Newell, Evan W;Fulton, Robert S;Sheehan, Kathleen C F;Oh, Stephen T;Schreiber, Robert D;Artyomov, Maxim N"
30340042,2018,Cell,Targeting Processive Transcription Elongation via SEC Disruption for MYC-Induced Cancer Therapy.,"The super elongation complex (SEC) is required for robust and productive transcription through release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with its P-TEFb module and promoting transcriptional processivity with its ELL2 subunit. Malfunction of SEC contributes to multiple human diseases including cancer. Here, we identify peptidomimetic lead compounds, KL-1 and its structural homolog KL-2, which disrupt the interaction between the SEC scaffolding protein AFF4 and P-TEFb, resulting in impaired release of Pol II from promoter-proximal pause sites and a reduced average rate of processive transcription elongation. SEC is required for induction of heat-shock genes and treating cells with KL-1 and KL-2 attenuates the heat-shock response from Drosophila to human. SEC inhibition downregulates MYC and MYC-dependent transcriptional programs in mammalian cells and delays tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model of MYC-driven cancer, indicating that small-molecule disruptors of SEC could be used for targeted therapy of MYC-induced cancer.","Liang, Kaiwei;Smith, Edwin R;Aoi, Yuki;Stoltz, Kristen L;Katagi, Hiroaki;Woodfin, Ashley R;Rendleman, Emily J;Marshall, Stacy A;Murray, David C;Wang, Lu;Ozark, Patrick A;Mishra, Rama K;Hashizume, Rintaro;Schiltz, Gary E;Shilatifard, Ali"
30340040,2018,Cell,Dysregulated Microbial Fermentation of Soluble Fiber Induces Cholestatic Liver Cancer.,"Dietary soluble fibers are fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are considered broadly health-promoting. Accordingly, consumption of such fibers ameliorates metabolic syndrome. However, incorporating soluble fiber inulin, but not insoluble fiber, into a compositionally defined diet, induced icteric hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such HCC was microbiota-dependent and observed in multiple strains of dysbiotic mice but not in germ-free nor antibiotics-treated mice. Furthermore, consumption of an inulin-enriched high-fat diet induced both dysbiosis and HCC in wild-type (WT) mice. Inulin-induced HCC progressed via early onset of cholestasis, hepatocyte death, followed by neutrophilic inflammation in liver. Pharmacologic inhibition of fermentation or depletion of fermenting bacteria markedly reduced intestinal SCFA and prevented HCC. Intervening with cholestyramine to prevent reabsorption of bile acids also conferred protection against such HCC. Thus, its benefits notwithstanding, enrichment of foods with fermentable fiber should be approached with great caution as it may increase risk of HCC.","Singh, Vishal;Yeoh, Beng San;Chassaing, Benoit;Xiao, Xia;Saha, Piu;Aguilera Olvera, Rodrigo;Lapek, John D;Zhang, Limin;Wang, Wei-Bei;Hao, Sijie;Flythe, Michael D;Gonzalez, David J;Cani, Patrice D;Conejo-Garcia, Jose R;Xiong, Na;Kennett, Mary J;Joe, Bina;Patterson, Andrew D;Gewirtz, Andrew T;Vijay-Kumar, Matam"

30290139,2018,Cell,A Paradigm Shift in Cancer Immunotherapy: From Enhancement to Normalization.,"Harnessing an antitumor immune response has been a fundamental strategy in cancer immunotherapy. For over a century, efforts have primarily focused on amplifying immune activation mechanisms that are employed by humans to eliminate invaders such as viruses and bacteria. This ""immune enhancement"" strategy often results in rare objective responses and frequent immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, in the last decade, cancer immunotherapies targeting the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway (anti-PD therapy), have achieved higher objective response rates in patients with much fewer irAEs. This more beneficial tumor response-to-toxicity profile stems from distinct mechanisms of action that restore tumor-induced immune deficiency selectively in the tumor microenvironment, here termed ""immune normalization,"" which has led to its FDA approval in more than 10 cancer indications and facilitated its combination with different therapies. In this article, we wish to highlight the principles of immune normalization and learn from it, with the ultimate goal to guide better designs for future cancer immunotherapies.","Sanmamed, Miguel F;Chen, Lieping"

30220459,2018,Cell,Transaminase Inhibition by 2-Hydroxyglutarate Impairs Glutamate Biosynthesis and Redox Homeostasis in Glioma.,"IDH1 mutations are common in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and cause overproduction of (R)-2HG. (R)-2HG modulates the activity of many enzymes, including some that are linked to transformation and some that are probably bystanders. Although prior work on (R)-2HG targets focused on 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, we found that (R)-2HG potently inhibits the 2OG-dependent transaminases BCAT1 and BCAT2, likely as a bystander effect, thereby decreasing glutamate levels and increasing dependence on glutaminase for the biosynthesis of glutamate and one of its products, glutathione. Inhibiting glutaminase specifically sensitized IDH mutant glioma cells to oxidative stress in vitro and to radiation in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlight the complementary roles for BCATs and glutaminase in glutamate biosynthesis, explain the sensitivity of IDH mutant cells to glutaminase inhibitors, and suggest a strategy for maximizing the effectiveness of such inhibitors against IDH mutant gliomas.","McBrayer, Samuel K;Mayers, Jared R;DiNatale, Gabriel J;Shi, Diana D;Khanal, Januka;Chakraborty, Abhishek A;Sarosiek, Kristopher A;Briggs, Kimberly J;Robbins, Alissa K;Sewastianik, Tomasz;Shareef, Sarah J;Olenchock, Benjamin A;Parker, Seth J;Tateishi, Kensuke;Spinelli, Jessica B;Islam, Mirazul;Haigis, Marcia C;Looper, Ryan E;Ligon, Keith L;Bernstein, Bradley E;Carrasco, Ruben D;Cahill, Daniel P;Asara, John M;Metallo, Christian M;Yennawar, Neela H;Vander Heiden, Matthew G;Kaelin, William G"
30193111,2018,Cell,A Structured Tumor-Immune Microenvironment in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Revealed by Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging.,"The immune system is critical in modulating cancer progression, but knowledge of immune composition, phenotype, and interactions with tumor is limited. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to simultaneously quantify in situ expression of 36 proteins covering identity, function, and immune regulation at sub-cellular resolution in 41 triple-negative breast cancer patients. Multi-step processing, including deep-learning-based segmentation, revealed variability in the composition of tumor-immune populations across individuals, reconciled by overall immune infiltration and enriched co-occurrence of immune subpopulations and checkpoint expression. Spatial enrichment analysis showed immune mixed and compartmentalized tumors, coinciding with expression of PD1, PD-L1, and IDO in a cell-type- and location-specific manner. Ordered immune structures along the tumor-immune border were associated with compartmentalization and linked to survival. These data demonstrate organization in the tumor-immune microenvironment that is structured in cellular composition, spatial arrangement, and regulatory-protein expression and provide a framework to apply multiplexed imaging to immune oncology.","Keren, Leeat;Bosse, Marc;Marquez, Diana;Angoshtari, Roshan;Jain, Samir;Varma, Sushama;Yang, Soo-Ryum;Kurian, Allison;Van Valen, David;West, Robert;Bendall, Sean C;Angelo, Michael"

Here we describe the development of CKIα inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIα-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIα together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2","Minzel, Waleed;Venkatachalam, Avanthika;Fink, Avner;Hung, Eric;Brachya, Guy;Burstain, Ido;Shaham, Maya;Rivlin, Amitai;Omer, Itay;Zinger, Adar;Elias, Shlomo;Winter, Eitan;Erdman, Paul E;Sullivan, Robert W;Fung, Leah;Mercurio, Frank;Li, Dansu;Vacca, Joseph;Kaushansky, Nathali;Shlush, Liran;Oren, Moshe;Levine, Ross;Pikarsky, Eli;Snir-Alkalay, Irit;Ben-Neriah, Yinon"
30100187,2018,Cell,"Nuclear Pores Promote Lethal Prostate Cancer by Increasing POM121-Driven E2F1, MYC, and AR Nuclear Import.","Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) regulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, transcription, and genome integrity in eukaryotic cells. However, their functional roles in cancer remain poorly understood. We interrogated the evolutionary transcriptomic landscape of NPC components, nucleoporins (Nups), from primary to advanced metastatic human prostate cancer (PC). Focused loss-of-function genetic screen of top-upregulated Nups in aggressive PC models identified POM121 as a key contributor to PC aggressiveness. Mechanistically, POM121 promoted PC progression by enhancing importin-dependent nuclear transport of key oncogenic (E2F1, MYC) and PC-specific (AR-GATA2) transcription factors, uncovering a pharmacologically targetable axis that, when inhibited, decreased tumor growth, restored standard therapy efficacy, and improved survival in patient-derived pre-clinical models. Our studies molecularly establish a role of NPCs in PC progression and give a rationale for NPC-regulated nuclear import targeting as a therapeutic strategy for lethal PC. These findings may have implications for understanding how NPC deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of other tumor types.","Rodriguez-Bravo, Veronica;Pippa, Raffaella;Song, Won-Min;Carceles-Cordon, Marc;Dominguez-Andres, Ana;Fujiwara, Naoto;Woo, Jungreem;Koh, Anna P;Ertel, Adam;Lokareddy, Ravi K;Cuesta-Dominguez, Alvaro;Kim, Rosa S;Rodriguez-Fernandez, Irene;Li, Peiyao;Gordon, Ronald;Hirschfield, Hadassa;Prats, Josep M;Reddy, E Premkumar;Fatatis, Alessandro;Petrylak, Daniel P;Gomella, Leonard;Kelly, W Kevin;Lowe, Scott W;Knudsen, Karen E;Galsky, Matthew D;Cingolani, Gino;Lujambio, Amaia;Hoshida, Yujin;Domingo-Domenech, Josep"
30100185,2018,Cell,Urea Cycle Dysregulation Generates Clinically Relevant Genomic and Biochemical Signatures.,"The urea cycle (UC) is the main pathway by which mammals dispose of waste nitrogen. We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed ""UC dysregulation"" (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response.","Lee, Joo Sang;Adler, Lital;Karathia, Hiren;Carmel, Narin;Rabinovich, Shiran;Auslander, Noam;Keshet, Rom;Stettner, Noa;Silberman, Alon;Agemy, Lilach;Helbling, Daniel;Eilam, Raya;Sun, Qin;Brandis, Alexander;Malitsky, Sergey;Itkin, Maxim;Weiss, Hila;Pinto, Sivan;Kalaora, Shelly;Levy, Ronen;Barnea, Eilon;Admon, Arie;Dimmock, David;Stern-Ginossar, Noam;Scherz, Avigdor;Nagamani, Sandesh C S;Unda, Miguel;Wilson, David M;Elhasid, Ronit;Carracedo, Arkaitz;Samuels, Yardena;Hannenhalli, Sridhar;Ruppin, Eytan;Erez, Ayelet"
30096312,2018,Cell,Divergent Routes toward Wnt and R-spondin Niche Independency during Human Gastric Carcinogenesis.,"Recent sequencing analyses have shed light on heterogeneous patterns of genomic aberrations in human gastric cancers (GCs). To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs. Our results collectively demonstrate that multifaceted genetic abnormalities render human GCs independent of the stem cell niche and highlight the validity of the genotype-phenotype screening strategy in gaining deeper understanding of human cancers.","Nanki, Kosaku;Toshimitsu, Kohta;Takano, Ai;Fujii, Masayuki;Shimokawa, Mariko;Ohta, Yuki;Matano, Mami;Seino, Takashi;Nishikori, Shingo;Ishikawa, Keiko;Kawasaki, Kenta;Togasaki, Kazuhiro;Takahashi, Sirirat;Sukawa, Yasutaka;Ishida, Hiroki;Sugimoto, Shinya;Kawakubo, Hirofumi;Kim, Jihoon;Kitagawa, Yuko;Sekine, Shigeki;Koo, Bon-Kyoung;Kanai, Takanori;Sato, Toshiro"

Through integrative deep whole-genome and -transcriptome analysis of 101 castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases (109X tumor/38X normal coverage), we identified structural variants altering critical regulators of tumorigenesis and progression not detectable by exome approaches. Notably, we observed amplification of an intergenic enhancer region 624 kb upstream of the androgen receptor (AR) in 81% of patients, correlating with increased AR expression. Tandem duplication hotspots also occur near MYC, in lncRNAs associated with post-translational MYC regulation. Classes of structural variations were linked to distinct DNA repair deficiencies, suggesting their etiology, including associations of CDK12 mutation with tandem duplications, TP53 inactivation with inverted rearrangements and chromothripsis, and BRCA2 inactivation with deletions.

30033362,2018,Cell,Risk SNP-Mediated Promoter-Enhancer Switching Drives Prostate Cancer through lncRNA PCAT19.,"The prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNP rs11672691 is positively associated with aggressive disease at diagnosis. We showed that rs11672691 maps to the promoter of a short isoform of long noncoding RNA PCAT19 (PCAT19-short), which is in the third intron of the long isoform (PCAT19-long). The risk variant is associated with decreased and increased levels of PCAT19-short and PCAT19-long, respectively. Mechanistically, the risk SNP region is bifunctional with both promoter and enhancer activity. The risk variants of rs11672691 and its LD SNP rs887391 decrease binding of transcription factors NKX3.1 and YY1 to the promoter of PCAT19-short, resulting in weaker promoter but stronger enhancer activity that subsequently activates PCAT19-long. PCAT19-long interacts with HNRNPAB to activate a subset of cell-cycle genes associated with PCa progression, thereby promoting PCa tumor growth and metastasis.

30033361,2018,Cell,Biology and Clinical Implications of the 19q13 Aggressive Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Locus.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified rs11672691 at 19q13 associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we independently confirmed the finding in a cohort of 2,738 PCa patients and discovered the biological mechanism underlying this association. We found an association of the aggressive PCa-associated allele G of rs11672691 with elevated transcript levels of two biologically plausible candidate genes, PCAT19 and CEACAM21, implicated in PCa cell growth and tumor progression. Mechanistically, rs11672691 resides in an enhancer element and alters the binding site of HOXA2, a novel oncogenic transcription factor with prognostic potential in PCa. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide editing showed the direct effect of rs11672691 on PCAT19 and CEACAM21 expression and PCa cellular aggressive phenotype. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of rs11672691 genotype and PCAT19/CEACAM21 gene expression on PCa prognosis. These results provide a plausible mechanism for rs11672691 associated with aggressive PCa and thus lay the ground work for translating this finding to the clinic.","Gao, Ping;Xia, Ji-Han;Sipeky, Csilla;Dong, Xiao-Ming;Zhang, Qin;Yang, Yuehong;Zhang, Peng;Cruz, Sara Pereira;Zhang, Kai;Zhu, Jing;Lee, Hang-Mao;Suleman, Sufyan;Giannareas, Nikolaos;Liu, Song;Tammela, Teuvo L J;Auvinen, Anssi;Wang, Xiaoyue;Huang, Qilai;Wang, Liguo;Manninen, Aki;Vaarala, Markku H;Wang, Liang;Schleutker, Johanna;Wei, Gong-Hong"
30017245,2018,Cell,Toward Minimal Residual Disease-Directed Therapy in Melanoma.,"Many patients with advanced cancers achieve dramatic responses to a panoply of therapeutics yet retain minimal residual disease (MRD), which ultimately results in relapse. To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance. These data identify NCSCs as key drivers of resistance and illustrate the therapeutic potential of MRD-directed therapy. They also highlight how gene regulatory network architecture reprogramming may be therapeutically exploited to limit cellular heterogeneity, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance.","Rambow, Florian;Rogiers, Aljosja;Marin-Bejar, Oskar;Aibar, Sara;Femel, Julia;Dewaele, Michael;Karras, Panagiotis;Brown, Daniel;Chang, Young Hwan;Debiec-Rychter, Maria;Adriaens, Carmen;Radaelli, Enrico;Wolter, Pascal;Bechter, Oliver;Dummer, Reinhard;Levesque, Mitchell;Piris, Adriano;Frederick, Dennie T;Boland, Genevieve;Flaherty, Keith T;van den Oord, Joost;Voet, Thierry;Aerts, Stein;Lund, Amanda W;Marine, Jean-Christophe"

We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity.

29909987,2018,Cell,A Somatically Acquired Enhancer of the Androgen Receptor Is a Noncoding Driver in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Increased androgen receptor (AR) activity drives therapeutic resistance in advanced prostate cancer. The most common resistance mechanism is amplification of this locus presumably targeting the AR gene. Here, we identify and characterize a somatically acquired AR enhancer located 650 kb centromeric to the AR. Systematic perturbation of this enhancer using genome editing decreased proliferation by suppressing AR levels. Insertion of an additional copy of this region sufficed to increase proliferation under low androgen conditions and to decrease sensitivity to enzalutamide. Epigenetic data generated in localized prostate tumors and benign specimens support the notion that this region is a developmental enhancer. Collectively, these observations underscore the importance of epigenomic profiling in primary specimens and the value of deploying genome editing to functionally characterize noncoding elements. More broadly, this work identifies a therapeutic vulnerability for targeting the AR and emphasizes the importance of regulatory elements as highly recurrent oncogenic drivers.","Takeda, David Y;Spisák, Sándor;Seo, Ji-Heui;Bell, Connor;O'Connor, Edward;Korthauer, Keegan;Ribli, Dezső;Csabai, István;Solymosi, Norbert;Szállási, Zoltán;Stillman, David R;Cejas, Paloma;Qiu, Xintao;Long, Henry W;Tisza, Viktória;Nuzzo, Pier Vitale;Rohanizadegan, Mersedeh;Pomerantz, Mark M;Hahn, William C;Freedman, Matthew L"

Unexpectedly, these rearrangements include highly recurrent tandem duplications involving an upstream enhancer of AR in 70%-87% of cases compared with <2% of primary prostate cancers. A subset of cases displayed AR or MYC enhancer duplication in the context of a genome-wide tandem duplicator phenotype associated with CDK12 inactivation. Our findings highlight the complex genomic structure of mCRPC, nominate alterations that may inform prostate cancer treatment, and suggest that additional recurrent events in the non-coding mCRPC genome remain to be discovered.","Viswanathan, Srinivas R;Ha, Gavin;Hoff, Andreas M;Wala, Jeremiah A;Carrot-Zhang, Jian;Whelan, Christopher W;Haradhvala, Nicholas J;Freeman, Samuel S;Reed, Sarah C;Rhoades, Justin;Polak, Paz;Cipicchio, Michelle;Wankowicz, Stephanie A;Wong, Alicia;Kamath, Tushar;Zhang, Zhenwei;Gydush, Gregory J;Rotem, Denisse;Love, J Christopher;Getz, Gad;Gabriel, Stacey;Zhang, Cheng-Zhong;Dehm, Scott M;Nelson, Peter S;Van Allen, Eliezer M;Choudhury, Atish D;Adalsteinsson, Viktor A;Beroukhim, Rameen;Taplin, Mary-Ellen;Meyerson, Matthew"
29906450,2018,Cell,Inactivation of CDK12 Delineates a Distinct Immunogenic Class of Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Using integrative genomic analysis of 360 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) samples, we identified a novel subtype of prostate cancer typified by biallelic loss of CDK12 that is mutually exclusive with tumors driven by DNA repair deficiency, ETS fusions, and SPOP mutations. CDK12 loss is enriched in mCRPC relative to clinically localized disease and characterized by focal tandem duplications (FTDs) that lead to increased gene fusions and marked differential gene expression. FTDs associated with CDK12 loss result in highly recurrent gains at loci of genes involved in the cell cycle and DNA replication. CDK12 mutant cases are baseline diploid and do not exhibit DNA mutational signatures linked to defects in homologous recombination. CDK12 mutant cases are associated with elevated neoantigen burden ensuing from fusion-induced chimeric open reading frames and increased tumor T cell infiltration/clonal expansion. CDK12 inactivation thereby defines a distinct class of mCRPC that may benefit from immune checkpoint immunotherapy.","Wu, Yi-Mi;Cieślik, Marcin;Lonigro, Robert J;Vats, Pankaj;Reimers, Melissa A;Cao, Xuhong;Ning, Yu;Wang, Lisha;Kunju, Lakshmi P;de Sarkar, Navonil;Heath, Elisabeth I;Chou, Jonathan;Feng, Felix Y;Nelson, Peter S;de Bono, Johann S;Zou, Weiping;Montgomery, Bruce;Alva, Ajjai;Robinson, Dan R;Chinnaiyan, Arul M"
29856956,2018,Cell,Genetic Inactivation of CD33 in Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Enable CAR T Cell Immunotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"The absence of cancer-restricted surface markers is a major impediment to antigen-specific immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. For example, targeting the canonical myeloid marker CD33 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in toxicity from destruction of normal myeloid cells. We hypothesized that a leukemia-specific antigen could be created by deleting CD33 from normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), thereby generating a hematopoietic system resistant to CD33-targeted therapy and enabling specific targeting of AML with CAR T cells. We generated CD33-deficient human HSPCs and demonstrated normal engraftment and differentiation in immunodeficient mice. Autologous CD33 KO HSPC transplantation in rhesus macaques demonstrated long-term multilineage engraftment of gene-edited cells with normal myeloid function. CD33-deficient cells were impervious to CD33-targeting CAR T cells, allowing for efficient elimination of leukemia without myelotoxicity. These studies illuminate a novel approach to antigen-specific immunotherapy by genetically engineering the host to avoid on-target, off-tumor toxicity.","Kim, Miriam Y;Yu, Kyung-Rok;Kenderian, Saad S;Ruella, Marco;Chen, Shirley;Shin, Tae-Hoon;Aljanahi, Aisha A;Schreeder, Daniel;Klichinsky, Michael;Shestova, Olga;Kozlowski, Miroslaw S;Cummins, Katherine D;Shan, Xinhe;Shestov, Maksim;Bagg, Adam;Morrissette, Jennifer J D;Sekhri, Palak;Lazzarotto, Cicera R;Calvo, Katherine R;Kuhns, Douglas B;Donahue, Robert E;Behbehani, Gregory K;Tsai, Shengdar Q;Dunbar, Cynthia E;Gill, Saar"

29754820,2018,Cell,Interfaces of Malignant and Immunologic Clonal Dynamics in Ovarian Cancer.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between T cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion.","Zhang, Allen W;McPherson, Andrew;Milne, Katy;Kroeger, David R;Hamilton, Phineas T;Miranda, Alex;Funnell, Tyler;Little, Nicole;de Souza, Camila P E;Laan, Sonya;LeDoux, Stacey;Cochrane, Dawn R;Lim, Jamie L P;Yang, Winnie;Roth, Andrew;Smith, Maia A;Ho, Julie;Tse, Kane;Zeng, Thomas;Shlafman, Inna;Mayo, Michael R;Moore, Richard;Failmezger, Henrik;Heindl, Andreas;Wang, Yi Kan;Bashashati, Ali;Grewal, Diljot S;Brown, Scott D;Lai, Daniel;Wan, Adrian N C;Nielsen, Cydney B;Huebner, Curtis;Tessier-Cloutier, Basile;Anglesio, Michael S;Bouchard-Côté, Alexandre;Yuan, Yinyin;Wasserman, Wyeth W;Gilks, C Blake;Karnezis, Anthony N;Aparicio, Samuel;McAlpine, Jessica N;Huntsman, David G;Holt, Robert A;Nelson, Brad H;Shah, Sohrab P"
29754815,2018,Cell,An Acquired Vulnerability of Drug-Resistant Melanoma with Therapeutic Potential.,"BRAF(V600E) mutant melanomas treated with inhibitors of the BRAF and MEK kinases almost invariably develop resistance that is frequently caused by reactivation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To identify novel treatment options for such patients, we searched for acquired vulnerabilities of MAPK inhibitor-resistant melanomas. We find that resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitors is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat suppresses SLC7A11, leading to a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS in drug-resistant cells. This causes selective apoptotic death of only the drug-resistant tumor cells. Consistently, treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma with vorinostat in mice results in dramatic tumor regression. In a study in patients with advanced BRAF+MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma, we find that vorinostat can selectively ablate drug-resistant tumor cells, providing clinical proof of concept for the novel therapy identified here.","Wang, Liqin;Leite de Oliveira, Rodrigo;Huijberts, Sanne;Bosdriesz, Evert;Pencheva, Nora;Brunen, Diede;Bosma, Astrid;Song, Ji-Ying;Zevenhoven, John;Los-de Vries, G Tjitske;Horlings, Hugo;Nuijen, Bastiaan;Beijnen, Jos H;Schellens, Jan H M;Bernards, Rene"
29731168,2018,Cell,Promoter of lncRNA Gene PVT1 Is a Tumor-Suppressor DNA Boundary Element.,"Noncoding mutations in cancer genomes are frequent but challenging to interpret. PVT1 encodes an oncogenic lncRNA, but recurrent translocations and deletions in human cancers suggest alternative mechanisms. Here, we show that the PVT1 promoter has a tumor-suppressor function that is independent of PVT1 lncRNA. CRISPR interference of PVT1 promoter enhances breast cancer cell competition and growth in vivo. The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition. Cancer genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations encompassing the human PVT1 promoter, and genome editing verified that PVT1 promoter mutation promotes cancer cell growth. These results highlight regulatory sequences of lncRNA genes as potential disease-associated DNA elements.","Cho, Seung Woo;Xu, Jin;Sun, Ruping;Mumbach, Maxwell R;Carter, Ava C;Chen, Y Grace;Yost, Kathryn E;Kim, Jeewon;He, Jing;Nevins, Stephanie A;Chin, Suet-Feung;Caldas, Carlos;Liu, S John;Horlbeck, Max A;Lim, Daniel A;Weissman, Jonathan S;Curtis, Christina;Chang, Howard Y"

29681457,2018,Cell,The Evolutionary Landscape of Localized Prostate Cancers Drives Clinical Aggression.,"The majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancers are slow growing, with a long natural life history. Yet a subset can metastasize with lethal consequences. We reconstructed the phylogenies of 293 localized prostate tumors linked to clinical outcome data. Multiple subclones were detected in 59% of patients, and specific subclonal architectures associate with adverse clinicopathological features. Early tumor development is characterized by point mutations and deletions followed by later subclonal amplifications and changes in trinucleotide mutational signatures. Specific genes are selectively mutated prior to or following subclonal diversification, including MTOR, NKX3-1, and RB1. Patients with low-risk monoclonal tumors rarely relapse after primary therapy (7%), while those with high-risk polyclonal tumors frequently do (61%). The presence of multiple subclones in an index biopsy may be necessary, but not sufficient, for relapse of localized prostate cancer, suggesting that evolution-aware biomarkers should be studied in prospective studies of low-risk tumors suitable for active surveillance.","Espiritu, Shadrielle Melijah G;Liu, Lydia Y;Rubanova, Yulia;Bhandari, Vinayak;Holgersen, Erle M;Szyca, Lesia M;Fox, Natalie S;Chua, Melvin L K;Yamaguchi, Takafumi N;Heisler, Lawrence E;Livingstone, Julie;Wintersinger, Jeff;Yousif, Fouad;Lalonde, Emilie;Rouette, Alexandre;Salcedo, Adriana;Houlahan, Kathleen E;Li, Constance H;Huang, Vincent;Fraser, Michael;van der Kwast, Theodorus;Morris, Quaid D;Bristow, Robert G;Boutros, Paul C"
29681456,2018,Cell,Chemoresistance Evolution in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Delineated by Single-Cell Sequencing.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that frequently develops resistance to chemotherapy. An unresolved question is whether resistance is caused by the selection of rare pre-existing clones or alternatively through the acquisition of new genomic aberrations. To investigate this question, we applied single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing in addition to bulk exome sequencing to profile longitudinal samples from 20 TNBC patients during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Deep-exome sequencing identified 10 patients in which NAC led to clonal extinction and 10 patients in which clones persisted after treatment. In 8 patients, we performed a more detailed study using single-cell DNA sequencing to analyze 900 cells and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze 6,862 cells. Our data showed that resistant genotypes were pre-existing and adaptively selected by NAC, while transcriptional profiles were acquired by reprogramming in response to chemotherapy in TNBC patients.","Kim, Charissa;Gao, Ruli;Sei, Emi;Brandt, Rachel;Hartman, Johan;Hatschek, Thomas;Crosetto, Nicola;Foukakis, Theodoros;Navin, Nicholas E"
29681454,2018,Cell,Chemistry-First Approach for Nomination of Personalized Treatment in Lung Cancer.,"Diversity in the genetic lesions that cause cancer is extreme. In consequence, a pressing challenge is the development of drugs that target patient-specific disease mechanisms. To address this challenge, we employed a chemistry-first discovery paradigm for de novo identification of druggable targets linked to robust patient selection hypotheses. In particular, a 200,000 compound diversity-oriented chemical library was profiled across a heavily annotated test-bed of >100 cellular models representative of the diverse and characteristic somatic lesions for lung cancer. This approach led to the delineation of 171 chemical-genetic associations, shedding light on the targetability of mechanistic vulnerabilities corresponding to a range of oncogenotypes present in patient populations lacking effective therapy. Chemically addressable addictions to ciliogenesis in TTC21B mutants and GLUT8-dependent serine biosynthesis in KRAS/KEAP1 double mutants are prominent examples.

Metastatic competence was afforded by chromosome complexity, and we identify 9p loss as a highly selected event driving metastasis and ccRCC-related mortality (p = 0.0014). Distinct patterns of metastatic dissemination were observed, including rapid progression to multiple tissue sites seeded by primary tumors of monoclonal structure. By contrast, we observed attenuated progression in cases characterized by high primary tumor heterogeneity, with metastatic competence acquired gradually and initial progression to solitary metastasis. Finally, we observed early divergence of primitive ancestral clones and protracted latency of up to two decades as a feature of pancreatic metastases.","Turajlic, Samra;Xu, Hang;Litchfield, Kevin;Rowan, Andrew;Chambers, Tim;Lopez, Jose I;Nicol, David;O'Brien, Tim;Larkin, James;Horswell, Stuart;Stares, Mark;Au, Lewis;Jamal-Hanjani, Mariam;Challacombe, Ben;Chandra, Ashish;Hazell, Steve;Eichler-Jonsson, Claudia;Soultati, Aspasia;Chowdhury, Simon;Rudman, Sarah;Lynch, Joanna;Fernando, Archana;Stamp, Gordon;Nye, Emma;Jabbar, Faiz;Spain, Lavinia;Lall, Sharanpreet;Guarch, Rosa;Falzon, Mary;Proctor, Ian;Pickering, Lisa;Gore, Martin;Watkins, Thomas B K;Ward, Sophia;Stewart, Aengus;DiNatale, Renzo;Becerra, Maria F;Reznik, Ed;Hsieh, James J;Richmond, Todd A;Mayhew, George F;Hill, Samantha M;McNally, Catherine D;Jones, Carol;Rosenbaum, Heidi;Stanislaw, Stacey;Burgess, Daniel L;Alexander, Nelson R;Swanton, Charles"

We observe up to 30 driver events per tumor and show that subclonal diversification is associated with known prognostic parameters. By resolving the patterns of driver event ordering, co-occurrence, and mutual exclusivity at clone level, we show the deterministic nature of clonal evolution. ccRCC can be grouped into seven evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumors characterized by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number drivers and rapid metastases to highly branched tumors with >10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution associated with attenuated progression. We identify genetic diversity and chromosomal complexity as determinants of patient outcome.

29656892,2018,Cell,Cancer-Germline Antigen Expression Discriminates Clinical Outcome to CTLA-4 Blockade.,"CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade is clinically effective in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma. We identify a subcluster of MAGE-A cancer-germline antigens, located within a narrow 75 kb region of chromosome Xq28, that predicts resistance uniquely to blockade of CTLA-4, but not PD-1. We validate this gene expression signature in an independent anti-CTLA-4-treated cohort and show its specificity to the CTLA-4 pathway with two independent anti-PD-1-treated cohorts. Autophagy, a process critical for optimal anti-cancer immunity, has previously been shown to be suppressed by the MAGE-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. We now show that the expression of the key autophagosome component LC3B and other activators of autophagy are negatively associated with MAGE-A protein levels in human melanomas, including samples from patients with resistance to CTLA-4 blockade.

29656891,2018,Cell,Timing the Landmark Events in the Evolution of Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer: TRACERx Renal.,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by near-universal loss of the short arm of chromosome 3, deleting several tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5' UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor's most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred. Early development of ccRCC follows well-defined evolutionary trajectories, offering opportunity for early intervention.","Mitchell, Thomas J;Turajlic, Samra;Rowan, Andrew;Nicol, David;Farmery, James H R;O'Brien, Tim;Martincorena, Inigo;Tarpey, Patrick;Angelopoulos, Nicos;Yates, Lucy R;Butler, Adam P;Raine, Keiran;Stewart, Grant D;Challacombe, Ben;Fernando, Archana;Lopez, Jose I;Hazell, Steve;Chandra, Ashish;Chowdhury, Simon;Rudman, Sarah;Soultati, Aspasia;Stamp, Gordon;Fotiadis, Nicos;Pickering, Lisa;Au, Lewis;Spain, Lavinia;Lynch, Joanna;Stares, Mark;Teague, Jon;Maura, Francesco;Wedge, David C;Horswell, Stuart;Chambers, Tim;Litchfield, Kevin;Xu, Hang;Stewart, Aengus;Elaidi, Reza;Oudard, Stéphane;McGranahan, Nicholas;Csabai, Istvan;Gore, Martin;Futreal, P Andrew;Larkin, James;Lynch, Andy G;Szallasi, Zoltan;Swanton, Charles;Campbell, Peter J"

Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in vivo.

Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting a hypothesis centered on ""chromatin-state"" to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a computational method to infer causal enhancer-gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes.

29625051,2018,Cell,Machine Learning Identifies Stemness Features Associated with Oncogenic Dedifferentiation.,"Cancer progression involves the gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor and stem-cell-like features. Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.","Malta, Tathiane M;Sokolov, Artem;Gentles, Andrew J;Burzykowski, Tomasz;Poisson, Laila;Weinstein, John N;Kamińska, Bożena;Huelsken, Joerg;Omberg, Larsson;Gevaert, Olivier;Colaprico, Antonio;Czerwińska, Patrycja;Mazurek, Sylwia;Mishra, Lopa;Heyn, Holger;Krasnitz, Alex;Godwin, Andrew K;Lazar, Alexander J;Stuart, Joshua M;Hoadley, Katherine A;Laird, Peter W;Noushmehr, Houtan;Wiznerowicz, Maciej"

Using mutations, copy-number changes, mRNA expression, gene fusions and DNA methylation in 9,125 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyzed the mechanisms and patterns of somatic alterations in ten canonical pathways: cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGFβ signaling, p53 and β-catenin/Wnt. We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs.

At this historic junction marking the completion of genomic characterization of over 11,000 tumors from 33 cancer types, we present our current understanding of the molecular processes governing oncogenesis. We illustrate our insights into cancer through synthesis of the findings of the TCGA PanCancer Atlas project on three facets of oncogenesis: (1) somatic driver mutations, germline pathogenic variants, and their interactions in the tumor; (2) the influence of the tumor genome and epigenome on transcriptome and proteome; and (3) the relationship between tumor and the microenvironment, including implications for drugs targeting driver events and immunotherapies.

We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.","Hoadley, Katherine A;Yau, Christina;Hinoue, Toshinori;Wolf, Denise M;Lazar, Alexander J;Drill, Esther;Shen, Ronglai;Taylor, Alison M;Cherniack, Andrew D;Thorsson, Vésteinn;Akbani, Rehan;Bowlby, Reanne;Wong, Christopher K;Wiznerowicz, Maciej;Sanchez-Vega, Francisco;Robertson, A Gordon;Schneider, Barbara G;Lawrence, Michael S;Noushmehr, Houtan;Malta, Tathiane M;Stuart, Joshua M;Benz, Christopher C;Laird, Peter W"

Identifying oncogenic drivers that work primarily through dosage changes is a current challenge. Unrestrained proliferation is a critical hallmark of cancer. We constructed modular, barcoded libraries of human open reading frames (ORFs) and performed screens for proliferation regulators in multiple cell types. Approximately 10% of genes regulate proliferation, with most performing in an unexpectedly highly tissue-specific manner. Proliferation drivers in a given cell type showed specific enrichment in somatic copy number changes (SCNAs) from cognate tumors and helped predict aneuploidy patterns in those tumors, implying that tissue-type-specific genetic network architectures underlie SCNA and driver selection in different cancers. In vivo screening confirmed these results. We report a substantial contribution to the catalog of SCNA-associated cancer drivers, identifying 147 amplified and 107 deleted genes as potential drivers, and derive insights about the genetic network architecture of aneuploidy in tumors.","Sack, Laura Magill;Davoli, Teresa;Li, Mamie Z;Li, Yuyang;Xu, Qikai;Naxerova, Kamila;Wooten, Eric C;Bernardi, Ronald J;Martin, Timothy D;Chen, Ting;Leng, Yumei;Liang, Anthony C;Scorsone, Kathleen A;Westbrook, Thomas F;Wong, Kwok-Kin;Elledge, Stephen J"

While the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple types of cancer, our genetic studies revealed an essential role of PP2A in B cell tumors. Thereby, PP2A redirects glucose carbon utilization from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to salvage oxidative stress. This unique vulnerability reflects constitutively low PPP activity in B cells and transcriptional repression of G6PD and other key PPP enzymes by the B cell transcription factors PAX5 and IKZF1. Reflecting B-cell-specific transcriptional PPP-repression, glucose carbon utilization in B cells is heavily skewed in favor of glycolysis resulting in lack of PPP-dependent antioxidant protection. These findings reveal a gatekeeper function of the PPP in a broad range of B cell malignancies that can be efficiently targeted by small molecule inhibition of PP2A and G6PD.","Xiao, Gang;Chan, Lai N;Klemm, Lars;Braas, Daniel;Chen, Zhengshan;Geng, Huimin;Zhang, Qiuyi Chen;Aghajanirefah, Ali;Cosgun, Kadriye Nehir;Sadras, Teresa;Lee, Jaewoong;Mirzapoiazova, Tamara;Salgia, Ravi;Ernst, Thomas;Hochhaus, Andreas;Jumaa, Hassan;Jiang, Xiaoyan;Weinstock, David M;Graeber, Thomas G;Müschen, Markus"

Medulloblastoma metastases are found almost exclusively on the leptomeningeal surface of the brain and spinal cord; dissemination is therefore thought to occur through shedding of primary tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid followed by distal re-implantation on the leptomeninges. We present evidence for medulloblastoma circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in therapy-naive patients and demonstrate in vivo, through flank xenografting and parabiosis, that medulloblastoma CTCs can spread through the blood to the leptomeningeal space to form leptomeningeal metastases. Medulloblastoma leptomeningeal metastases express high levels of the chemokine CCL2, and expression of CCL2 in medulloblastoma in vivo is sufficient to drive leptomeningeal dissemination. Hematogenous dissemination of medulloblastoma offers a new opportunity to diagnose and treat lethal disseminated medulloblastoma.","Garzia, Livia;Kijima, Noriyuki;Morrissy, A Sorana;De Antonellis, Pasqualino;Guerreiro-Stucklin, Ana;Holgado, Borja L;Wu, Xiaochong;Wang, Xin;Parsons, Michael;Zayne, Kory;Manno, Alex;Kuzan-Fischer, Claudia;Nor, Carolina;Donovan, Laura K;Liu, Jessica;Qin, Lei;Garancher, Alexandra;Liu, Kun-Wei;Mansouri, Sheila;Luu, Betty;Thompson, Yuan Yao;Ramaswamy, Vijay;Peacock, John;Farooq, Hamza;Skowron, Patryk;Shih, David J H;Li, Angela;Ensan, Sherine;Robbins, Clinton S;Cybulsky, Myron;Mitra, Siddhartha;Ma, Yussanne;Moore, Richard;Mungall, Andy;Cho, Yoon-Jae;Weiss, William A;Chan, Jennifer A;Hawkins, Cynthia E;Massimino, Maura;Jabado, Nada;Zapotocky, Michal;Sumerauer, David;Bouffet, Eric;Dirks, Peter;Tabori, Uri;Sorensen, Poul H B;Brastianos, Priscilla K;Aldape, Kenneth;Jones, Steven J M;Marra, Marco A;Woodgett, James R;Wechsler-Reya, Robert J;Fults, Daniel W;Taylor, Michael D"

Despite unprecedented long-term responses, most patients do not respond to these therapies. Immunotherapy non-responders often harbor high levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)-an immunosuppressive innate cell population. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we uncovered a pathway governing MDSC abundance in multiple cancer types. Therapeutic liver-X nuclear receptor (LXR) agonism reduced MDSC abundance in murine models and in patients treated in a first-in-human dose escalation phase 1 trial. MDSC depletion was associated with activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in mice and patients. The LXR transcriptional target ApoE mediated these effects in mice, where LXR/ApoE activation therapy elicited robust anti-tumor responses and also enhanced T cell activation during various immune-based therapies.

Genomic evolution has been difficult to delineate during invasion due to intratumor heterogeneity and the low number of tumor cells in the ducts. To overcome these challenges, we developed Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) to measure genomic copy number profiles of single tumor cells while preserving their spatial context in tissue sections. We applied TSCS to 1,293 single cells from 10 synchronous patients with both DCIS and IDC regions in addition to exome sequencing. Our data reveal a direct genomic lineage between in situ and invasive tumor subpopulations and further show that most mutations and copy number aberrations evolved within the ducts prior to invasion. These results support a multiclonal invasion model, in which one or more clones escape the ducts and migrate into the adjacent tissues to establish the invasive carcinomas.","Casasent, Anna K;Schalck, Aislyn;Gao, Ruli;Sei, Emi;Long, Annalyssa;Pangburn, William;Casasent, Tod;Meric-Bernstam, Funda;Edgerton, Mary E;Navin, Nicholas E"
29275861,2018,Cell,Natural Killer Cells Control Tumor Growth by Sensing a Growth Factor.,"Many tumors produce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-DD, which promotes cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stromal reaction, and angiogenesis through autocrine and paracrine PDGFRβ signaling. By screening a secretome library, we found that the human immunoreceptor NKp44, encoded by NCR2 and expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid cells, recognizes PDGF-DD. PDGF-DD engagement of NKp44 triggered NK cell secretion of interferon gamma (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that induced tumor cell growth arrest. A distinctive transcriptional signature of PDGF-DD-induced cytokines and the downregulation of tumor cell-cycle genes correlated with NCR2 expression and greater survival in glioblastoma. NKp44 expression in mouse NK cells controlled the dissemination of tumors expressing PDGF-DD more effectively than control mice, an effect enhanced by blockade of the inhibitory receptor CD96 or CpG-oligonucleotide treatment. Thus, while cancer cell production of PDGF-DD supports tumor growth and stromal reaction, it concomitantly activates innate immune responses to tumor expansion.","Barrow, Alexander D;Edeling, Melissa A;Trifonov, Vladimir;Luo, Jingqin;Goyal, Piyush;Bohl, Benjamin;Bando, Jennifer K;Kim, Albert H;Walker, John;Andahazy, Mary;Bugatti, Mattia;Melocchi, Laura;Vermi, William;Fremont, Daved H;Cox, Sarah;Cella, Marina;Schmedt, Christian;Colonna, Marco"

However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations.

This is accompanied by suppression of MYC signaling and an increase in the T cell chemoattractant CCL5. Use of this combination treatment schema in mouse models of NSCLC reverses tumor immune evasion and modulates T cell exhaustion state towards memory and effector T cell phenotypes. Key correlative science metrics emerge for an upcoming clinical trial, testing enhancement of immune checkpoint therapy for NSCLC.","Topper, Michael J;Vaz, Michelle;Chiappinelli, Katherine B;DeStefano Shields, Christina E;Niknafs, Noushin;Yen, Ray-Whay Chiu;Wenzel, Alyssa;Hicks, Jessica;Ballew, Matthew;Stone, Meredith;Tran, Phuoc T;Zahnow, Cynthia A;Hellmann, Matthew D;Anagnostou, Valsamo;Strissel, Pamela L;Strick, Reiner;Velculescu, Victor E;Baylin, Stephen B"

29107334,2017,Cell,MHC-I Genotype Restricts the Oncogenic Mutational Landscape.,"MHC-I molecules expose the intracellular protein content on the cell surface, allowing T cells to detect foreign or mutated peptides. The combination of six MHC-I alleles each individual carries defines the sub-peptidome that can be effectively presented. We applied this concept to human cancer, hypothesizing that oncogenic mutations could arise in gaps in personal MHC-I presentation. To validate this hypothesis, we developed and applied a residue-centric patient presentation score to 9,176 cancer patients across 1,018 recurrent oncogenic mutations. We found that patient MHC-I genotype-based scores could predict which mutations were more likely to emerge in their tumor. Accordingly, poor presentation of a mutation across patients was correlated with higher frequency among tumors. These results support that MHC-I genotype-restricted immunoediting during tumor formation shapes the landscape of oncogenic mutations observed in clinically diagnosed tumors and paves the way for predicting personal cancer susceptibilities from knowledge of MHC-I genotype.","Marty, Rachel;Kaabinejadian, Saghar;Rossell, David;Slifker, Michael J;van de Haar, Joris;Engin, Hatice Billur;de Prisco, Nicola;Ideker, Trey;Hildebrand, William H;Font-Burgada, Joan;Carter, Hannah"
29107330,2017,Cell,Allele-Specific HLA Loss and Immune Escape in Lung Cancer Evolution.,"Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present neoantigens through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune evasion. However, the polymorphic nature of the locus has precluded accurate HLA copy-number analysis. Here, we present loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (LOHHLA), a computational tool to determine HLA allele-specific copy number from sequencing data. Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA LOH occurs in 40% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic activity, and PD-L1 positivity. The focal nature of HLA LOH alterations, their subclonal frequencies, enrichment in metastatic sites, and occurrence as parallel events suggests that HLA LOH is an immune escape mechanism that is subject to strong microenvironmental selection pressures later in tumor evolution. Characterizing HLA LOH with LOHHLA refines neoantigen prediction and may have implications for our understanding of resistance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic approaches targeting neoantigens.

29100075,2017,Cell,Comprehensive and Integrated Genomic Characterization of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcomas.,"Sarcomas are a broad family of mesenchymal malignancies exhibiting remarkable histologic diversity. We describe the multi-platform molecular landscape of 206 adult soft tissue sarcomas representing 6 major types. Along with novel insights into the biology of individual sarcoma types, we report three overarching findings: (1) unlike most epithelial malignancies, these sarcomas (excepting synovial sarcoma) are characterized predominantly by copy-number changes, with low mutational loads and only a few genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1) highly recurrently mutated across sarcoma types; (2) within sarcoma types, genomic and regulomic diversity of driver pathways defines molecular subtypes associated with patient outcome; and (3) the immune microenvironment, inferred from DNA methylation and mRNA profiles, associates with outcome and may inform clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, this large-scale analysis reveals previously unappreciated sarcoma-type-specific changes in copy number, methylation, RNA, and protein, providing insights into refining sarcoma therapy and relationships to other cancer types.",

29056346,2017,Cell,Universal Patterns of Selection in Cancer and Somatic Tissues.,"Cancer develops as a result of somatic mutation and clonal selection, but quantitative measures of selection in cancer evolution are lacking. We adapted methods from molecular evolution and applied them to 7,664 tumors across 29 cancer types. Unlike species evolution, positive selection outweighs negative selection during cancer development. On average, <1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection almost absent outside homozygous loss of essential genes. This allows exome-wide enumeration of all driver coding mutations, including outside known cancer genes. On average, tumors carry ∼4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from <1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to >10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly. We systematically catalog cancer genes and show that genes vary extensively in what proportion of mutations are drivers versus passengers.","Martincorena, Iñigo;Raine, Keiran M;Gerstung, Moritz;Dawson, Kevin J;Haase, Kerstin;Van Loo, Peter;Davies, Helen;Stratton, Michael R;Campbell, Peter J"

Hypermutation was detected in tumor types not previously associated with high mutation burden. Replication repair deficiency was a major contributing factor. We uncovered new driver mutations in the replication-repair-associated DNA polymerases and a distinct impact of microsatellite instability and replication repair deficiency on the scale of mutation load. Unbiased clustering, based on mutational context, revealed clinically relevant subgroups regardless of the tumors' tissue of origin, highlighting similarities in evolutionary dynamics leading to hypermutation. Mutagens, such as UV light, were implicated in unexpected cancers, including sarcomas and lung tumors. The order of mutational signatures identified previous treatment and germline replication repair deficiency, which improved management of patients and families.

29056342,2017,Cell,Synthetic RNA-Based Immunomodulatory Gene Circuits for Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Despite its success in several clinical trials, cancer immunotherapy remains limited by the rarity of targetable tumor-specific antigens, tumor-mediated immune suppression, and toxicity triggered by systemic delivery of potent immunomodulators. Here, we present a proof-of-concept immunomodulatory gene circuit platform that enables tumor-specific expression of immunostimulators, which could potentially overcome these limitations. Our design comprised de novo synthetic cancer-specific promoters and, to enhance specificity, an RNA-based AND gate that generates combinatorial immunomodulatory outputs only when both promoters are mutually active. These outputs included an immunogenic cell-surface protein, a cytokine, a chemokine, and a checkpoint inhibitor antibody. The circuits triggered selective T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells, but not of normal cells, in vitro. In in vivo efficacy assays, lentiviral circuit delivery mediated significant tumor reduction and prolonged mouse survival. Our design could be adapted to drive additional immunomodulators, sense other cancers, and potentially treat other diseases that require precise immunological programming.","Nissim, Lior;Wu, Ming-Ru;Pery, Erez;Binder-Nissim, Adina;Suzuki, Hiroshi I;Stupp, Doron;Wehrspaun, Claudia;Tabach, Yuval;Sharp, Phillip A;Lu, Timothy K"

We assessed genomic changes in tumors from 68 patients with advanced melanoma, who progressed on ipilimumab or were ipilimumab-naive, before and after nivolumab initiation (CA209-038 study). Tumors were analyzed by whole-exome, transcriptome, and/or T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. In responding patients, mutation and neoantigen load were reduced from baseline, and analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity during therapy demonstrated differential clonal evolution within tumors and putative selection against neoantigenic mutations on-therapy. Transcriptome analyses before and during nivolumab therapy revealed increases in distinct immune cell subsets, activation of specific transcriptional networks, and upregulation of immune checkpoint genes that were more pronounced in patients with response. Temporal changes in intratumoral TCR repertoire revealed expansion of T cell clones in the setting of neoantigen loss.

While direct pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 has proven challenging, its aberrant activation rewires biochemical networks in cancer cells that may create special vulnerabilities. Here, we use chemical proteomics to map druggable proteins that are selectively expressed in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. Principal among these is NR0B1, an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that we show engages in a multimeric protein complex to regulate the transcriptional output of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. We further identify small molecules that covalently target a conserved cysteine within the NR0B1 protein interaction domain, and we demonstrate that these compounds disrupt NR0B1 complexes and impair the anchorage-independent growth of KEAP1-mutant cancer cells.

We observed thousands of unique HPV16 genomes; very few women shared the identical HPV16 sequence, which should stimulate a careful re-evaluation of the clinical implications of HPV mutation rates, transmission, clearance, and persistence. In case-control analyses, HPV16 in the controls had significantly more amino acid changing variants throughout the genome. Strikingly, E7 was devoid of variants in precancers/cancers compared to higher levels in the controls; we confirmed this in cancers from around the world. Strict conservation of the 98 amino acids of E7, which disrupts Rb function, is critical for HPV16 carcinogenesis, presenting a highly specific target for etiologic and therapeutic research.","Mirabello, Lisa;Yeager, Meredith;Yu, Kai;Clifford, Gary M;Xiao, Yanzi;Zhu, Bin;Cullen, Michael;Boland, Joseph F;Wentzensen, Nicolas;Nelson, Chase W;Raine-Bennett, Tina;Chen, Zigui;Bass, Sara;Song, Lei;Yang, Qi;Steinberg, Mia;Burdett, Laurie;Dean, Michael;Roberson, David;Mitchell, Jason;Lorey, Thomas;Franceschi, Silvia;Castle, Philip E;Walker, Joan;Zuna, Rosemary;Kreimer, Aimée R;Beachler, Daniel C;Hildesheim, Allan;Gonzalez, Paula;Porras, Carolina;Burk, Robert D;Schiffman, Mark"

We have recently demonstrated a key role for the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits, p65 and c-Rel, in Treg identity and function. In this report, we show that NF-κB c-Rel ablation specifically impairs the generation and maintenance of the activated Treg (aTreg) subset, which is known to be enriched at sites of tumors. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that melanoma growth is drastically reduced in mice lacking c-Rel, but not p65, in Tregs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of c-Rel function delayed melanoma growth by impairing aTreg-mediated immunosuppression and potentiated the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our studies therefore establish inhibition of NF-κB c-Rel as a viable therapeutic approach for enhancing checkpoint-targeting immunotherapy protocols.","Grinberg-Bleyer, Yenkel;Oh, Hyunju;Desrichard, Alexis;Bhatt, Dev M;Caron, Rachel;Chan, Timothy A;Schmid, Roland M;Klein, Ulf;Hayden, Matthew S;Ghosh, Sankar"

In Ewing sarcoma, we find that the BAF complex is recruited by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein to tumor-specific enhancers and contributes to target gene activation. This process is a neomorphic property of EWS-FLI1 compared to wild-type FLI1 and depends on tyrosine residues that are necessary for phase transitions of the EWSR1 prion-like domain. Furthermore, fusion of short fragments of EWSR1 to FLI1 is sufficient to recapitulate BAF complex retargeting and EWS-FLI1 activities. Our studies thus demonstrate that the physical properties of prion-like domains can retarget critical chromatin regulatory complexes to establish and maintain oncogenic gene expression programs.","Boulay, Gaylor;Sandoval, Gabriel J;Riggi, Nicolo;Iyer, Sowmya;Buisson, Rémi;Naigles, Beverly;Awad, Mary E;Rengarajan, Shruthi;Volorio, Angela;McBride, Matthew J;Broye, Liliane C;Zou, Lee;Stamenkovic, Ivan;Kadoch, Cigall;Rivera, Miguel N"

We demonstrate that neural precursor cell (NPC):glioma cell communication underpins this propensity of glioma to colonize the SVZ through secretion of chemoattractant signals toward which glioma cells home. Biochemical, proteomic, and functional analyses of SVZ NPC-secreted factors revealed the neurite outgrowth-promoting factor pleiotrophin, along with required binding partners SPARC/SPARCL1 and HSP90B, as key mediators of this chemoattractant effect. Pleiotrophin expression is strongly enriched in the SVZ, and pleiotrophin knock down starkly reduced glioma invasion of the SVZ in the murine brain. Pleiotrophin, in complex with the binding partners, activated glioma Rho/ROCK signaling, and ROCK inhibition decreased invasion toward SVZ NPC-secreted factors. These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for NPC:glioma interactions and potential therapeutic targets to limit glioma invasion.

To address these issues, we utilized mass cytometry to comprehensively profile the effects of checkpoint blockade on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models. These analyses reveal a spectrum of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations that are highly similar between tumor models and indicate that checkpoint blockade targets only specific subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations.

Here, we used an organoid culture system to investigate how transcription and the enhancer landscape become altered during discrete stages of disease progression in a PDA mouse model. This approach revealed that the metastatic transition is accompanied by massive and recurrent alterations in enhancer activity. We implicate the pioneer factor FOXA1 as a driver of enhancer activation in this system, a mechanism that renders PDA cells more invasive and less anchorage-dependent for growth in vitro, as well as more metastatic in vivo. In this context, FOXA1-dependent enhancer reprogramming activates a transcriptional program of embryonic foregut endoderm.

28753430,2017,Cell,Defining a Cancer Dependency Map.,"Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC.

Furthermore, our bioinformatic and functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response.

28753428,2017,Cell,Clustered Mutation Signatures Reveal that Error-Prone DNA Repair Targets Mutations to Active Genes.,"Many processes can cause the same nucleotide change in a genome, making the identification of the mechanisms causing mutations a difficult challenge. Here, we show that clustered mutations provide a more precise fingerprint of mutagenic processes. Of nine clustered mutation signatures identified from >1,000 tumor genomes, three relate to variable APOBEC activity and three are associated with tobacco smoking. An additional signature matches the spectrum of translesion DNA polymerase eta (POLH). In lymphoid cells, these mutations target promoters, consistent with AID-initiated somatic hypermutation. In solid tumors, however, they are associated with UV exposure and alcohol consumption and target the H3K36me3 chromatin of active genes in a mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner. These regions normally have a low mutation rate because error-free MMR also targets H3K36me3 chromatin. Carcinogens and error-prone repair therefore redistribute mutations to the more important regions of the genome, contributing a substantial mutation load in many tumors, including driver mutations.","Supek, Fran;Lehner, Ben"

Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements.

28709002,2017,Cell,Exosome RNA Unshielding Couples Stromal Activation to Pattern Recognition Receptor Signaling in Cancer.,"Interactions between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells generate signals for cancer progression, therapy resistance, and inflammatory responses. Although endogenous RNAs acting as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may represent one such signal, these RNAs must remain unrecognized under non-pathological conditions. We show that triggering of stromal NOTCH-MYC by breast cancer cells results in a POL3-driven increase in RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA normally shielded by RNA binding proteins SRP9/14. This increase in RN7SL1 alters its stoichiometry with SRP9/14 and generates unshielded RN7SL1 in stromal exosomes. After exosome transfer to immune cells, unshielded RN7SL1 drives an inflammatory response. Upon transfer to breast cancer cells, unshielded RN7SL1 activates the PRR RIG-I to enhance tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Corroborated by evidence from patient tumors and blood, these results demonstrate that regulation of RNA unshielding couples stromal activation with deployment of RNA DAMPs that promote aggressive features of cancer.

Here, we find that different immune mononuclear phagocytes share a conserved steady-state program during differentiation and entry into healthy tissue. IFNγ is necessary and sufficient to induce this program, revealing a key instructive role. Remarkably, homeostatic and IFNγ-dependent programs enrich across primary human tumors, including melanoma, and stratify survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals enrichment of homeostatic modules in monocytes and DCs from human metastatic melanoma. Suppressor-of-cytokine-2 (SOCS2) protein, a conserved program transcript, is expressed by mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating primary melanoma and is induced by IFNγ. SOCS2 limits adaptive anti-tumoral immunity and DC-based priming of T cells in vivo, indicating a critical regulatory role.

We find that breakdown of stem cell lineage confinement-granting privileges associated with both fates-is not only hallmark but also functional in cancer development. We show that lineage plasticity is critical in wound repair, where it operates transiently to redirect fates. Investigating mechanism, we discover that irrespective of cellular origin, lineage infidelity occurs in wounding when stress-responsive enhancers become activated and override homeostatic enhancers that govern lineage specificity. In cancer, stress-responsive transcription factor levels rise, causing lineage commanders to reach excess. When lineage and stress factors collaborate, they activate oncogenic enhancers that distinguish cancers from wounds.","Ge, Yejing;Gomez, Nicholas C;Adam, Rene C;Nikolova, Maria;Yang, Hanseul;Verma, Akanksha;Lu, Catherine Pei-Ju;Polak, Lisa;Yuan, Shaopeng;Elemento, Olivier;Fuchs, Elaine"

In human disease, cancer cells within the CSF produced C3 in correlation with clinical course. C3 expression in primary tumors was predictive of leptomeningeal relapse. Mechanistically, we found that cancer-cell-derived C3 activates the C3a receptor in the choroid plexus epithelium to disrupt the blood-CSF barrier.

The search for these ""neoantigens"" has been facilitated by the combination of new sequencing technologies, specialized computational analyses, and HLA binding predictions that evaluate somatic alterations in a cancer genome and interpret their ability to produce an immune-stimulatory peptide. The resulting information can characterize a tumor's neoantigen load, its cadre of infiltrating immune cell types, the T or B cell receptor repertoire, and direct the design of a personalized therapeutic.","Liu, X Shirley;Mardis, Elaine R"

Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.","Wang, Tim;Yu, Haiyan;Hughes, Nicholas W;Liu, Bingxu;Kendirli, Arek;Klein, Klara;Chen, Walter W;Lander, Eric S;Sabatini, David M"
28111070,2017,Cell,Systemic Immunity Is Required for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Immune responses involve coordination across cell types and tissues. However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection.","Spitzer, Matthew H;Carmi, Yaron;Reticker-Flynn, Nathan E;Kwek, Serena S;Madhireddy, Deepthi;Martins, Maria M;Gherardini, Pier Federico;Prestwood, Tyler R;Chabon, Jonathan;Bendall, Sean C;Fong, Lawrence;Nolan, Garry P;Engleman, Edgar G"

Examples include surfactant proteins in lung alveoli, albumin in liver parenchyma, and lipase in the stomach lining. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinomas revealed noncoding somatic mutational hotspots near VMP1/MIR21 and indel hotspots in surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPB, and SFTPC). Extrapolation to other solid cancers demonstrated highly recurrent and tumor-type-specific indel hotspots targeting the noncoding regions of highly expressed genes defining certain secretory cellular lineages: albumin (ALB) in liver carcinoma, gastric lipase (LIPF) in stomach carcinoma, and thyroglobulin (TG) in thyroid carcinoma. The sequence contexts of indels targeting lineage-defining genes were significantly enriched in the AATAATD DNA motif and specific chromatin contexts, including H3K27ac and H3K36me3.

28065413,2017,Cell,Therapeutic Targeting of MLL Degradation Pathways in MLL-Rearranged Leukemia.,"Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras. Stabilization of MLL provides us with a paradigm in the development of therapies for aggressive MLL leukemia and perhaps for other cancers caused by translocations.","Liang, Kaiwei;Volk, Andrew G;Haug, Jeffrey S;Marshall, Stacy A;Woodfin, Ashley R;Bartom, Elizabeth T;Gilmore, Joshua M;Florens, Laurence;Washburn, Michael P;Sullivan, Kelly D;Espinosa, Joaquin M;Cannova, Joseph;Zhang, Jiwang;Smith, Edwin R;Crispino, John D;Shilatifard, Ali"
27984728,2016,Cell,Mutant KRAS Enhances Tumor Cell Fitness by Upregulating Stress Granules.,"There is growing evidence that stress-coping mechanisms represent tumor cell vulnerabilities that may function as therapeutically beneficial targets. Recent work has delineated an integrated stress adaptation mechanism that is characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic mRNA and protein foci, termed stress granules (SGs). Here, we demonstrate that SGs are markedly elevated in mutant KRAS cells following exposure to stress-inducing stimuli. The upregulation of SGs by mutant KRAS is dependent on the production of the signaling lipid molecule 15-deoxy-delta 12,14 prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2) and confers cytoprotection against stress stimuli and chemotherapeutic agents. The secretion of 15-d-PGJ2 by mutant KRAS cells is sufficient to enhance SG formation and stress resistance in cancer cells that are wild-type for KRAS. Our findings identify a mutant KRAS-dependent cell non-autonomous mechanism that may afford the establishment of a stress-resistant niche that encompasses different tumor subclones. These results should inform the design of strategies to eradicate tumor cell communities.","Grabocka, Elda;Bar-Sagi, Dafna"
27912061,2016,Cell,Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade.,"Therapeutic blocking of the PD1 pathway results in significant tumor responses, but resistance is common. We demonstrate that prolonged interferon signaling orchestrates PDL1-dependent and PDL1-independent resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and to combinations such as radiation plus anti-CTLA4. Persistent type II interferon signaling allows tumors to acquire STAT1-related epigenomic changes and augments expression of interferon-stimulated genes and ligands for multiple T cell inhibitory receptors. Both type I and II interferons maintain this resistance program. Crippling the program genetically or pharmacologically interferes with multiple inhibitory pathways and expands distinct T cell populations with improved function despite expressing markers of severe exhaustion. Consequently, tumors resistant to multi-agent ICB are rendered responsive to ICB monotherapy. Finally, we observe that biomarkers for interferon-driven resistance associate with clinical progression after anti-PD1 therapy. Thus, the duration of tumor interferon signaling augments adaptive resistance and inhibition of the interferon response bypasses requirements for combinatorial ICB therapies.","Benci, Joseph L;Xu, Bihui;Qiu, Yu;Wu, Tony J;Dada, Hannah;Twyman-Saint Victor, Christina;Cucolo, Lisa;Lee, David S M;Pauken, Kristen E;Huang, Alexander C;Gangadhar, Tara C;Amaravadi, Ravi K;Schuchter, Lynn M;Feldman, Michael D;Ishwaran, Hemant;Vonderheide, Robert H;Maity, Amit;Wherry, E John;Minn, Andy J"
27912060,2016,Cell,The Hippo Pathway Kinases LATS1/2 Suppress Cancer Immunity.,"Poorly immunogenic tumor cells evade host immunity and grow even in the presence of an intact immune system, but the complex mechanisms regulating tumor immunogenicity have not been elucidated. Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the Hippo pathway in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. We demonstrate that, in three different murine syngeneic tumor models (B16, SCC7, and 4T1), loss of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2) in tumor cells inhibits tumor growth. Tumor regression by LATS1/2 deletion requires adaptive immune responses, and LATS1/2 deficiency enhances tumor vaccine efficacy. Mechanistically, LATS1/2-null tumor cells secrete nucleic-acid-rich extracellular vesicles, which induce a type I interferon response via the Toll-like receptors-MYD88/TRIF pathway. LATS1/2 deletion in tumors thus improves tumor immunogenicity, leading to tumor destruction by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Our observations uncover a key role of the Hippo pathway in modulating tumor immunogenicity and demonstrate a proof of concept for targeting LATS1/2 in cancer immunotherapy.","Moroishi, Toshiro;Hayashi, Tomoko;Pan, Wei-Wei;Fujita, Yu;Holt, Matthew V;Qin, Jun;Carson, Dennis A;Guan, Kun-Liang"
27863244,2016,Cell,Epigenetic Activation of WNT5A Drives Glioblastoma Stem Cell Differentiation and Invasive Growth.,"Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are implicated in tumor neovascularization, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence. Thus, the PAX6/DLX5-WNT5A axis governs the diffuse spread of glioma cells throughout the brain parenchyma, contributing to the lethality of GBM.","Hu, Baoli;Wang, Qianghu;Wang, Y Alan;Hua, Sujun;Sauvé, Charles-Etienne Gabriel;Ong, Derrick;Lan, Zheng D;Chang, Qing;Ho, Yan Wing;Monasterio, Marta Moreno;Lu, Xin;Zhong, Yi;Zhang, Jianhua;Deng, Pingna;Tan, Zhi;Wang, Guocan;Liao, Wen-Ting;Corley, Lynda J;Yan, Haiyan;Zhang, Junxia;You, Yongping;Liu, Ning;Cai, Linbo;Finocchiaro, Gaetano;Phillips, Joanna J;Berger, Mitchel S;Spring, Denise J;Hu, Jian;Sulman, Erik P;Fuller, Gregory N;Chin, Lynda;Verhaak, Roeland G W;DePinho, Ronald A"
27839864,2016,Cell,FMN2 Makes Perinuclear Actin to Protect Nuclei during Confined Migration and Promote Metastasis.,"Cell migration in confined 3D tissue microenvironments is critical for both normal physiological functions and dissemination of tumor cells. We discovered a cytoskeletal structure that prevents damage to the nucleus during migration in confined microenvironments. The formin-family actin filament nucleator FMN2 associates with and generates a perinuclear actin/focal adhesion (FA) system that is distinct from previously characterized actin/FA structures. This system controls nuclear shape and positioning in cells migrating on 2D surfaces. In confined 3D microenvironments, FMN2 promotes cell survival by limiting nuclear envelope damage and DNA double-strand breaks. We found that FMN2 is upregulated in human melanomas and showed that disruption of FMN2 in mouse melanoma cells inhibits their extravasation and metastasis to the lung. Our results indicate a critical role for FMN2 in generating a perinuclear actin/FA system that protects the nucleus and DNA from damage to promote cell survival during confined migration and thus promote cancer metastasis.","Skau, Colleen T;Fischer, Robert S;Gurel, Pinar;Thiam, Hawa Racine;Tubbs, Anthony;Baird, Michelle A;Davidson, Michael W;Piel, Matthieu;Alushin, Gregory M;Nussenzweig, Andre;Steeg, Patricia S;Waterman, Clare M"

27745970,2016,Cell,L-Arginine Modulates T Cell Metabolism and Enhances Survival and Anti-tumor Activity.,"Metabolic activity is intimately linked to T cell fate and function. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we generated dynamic metabolome and proteome profiles of human primary naive T cells following activation. We discovered critical changes in the arginine metabolism that led to a drop in intracellular L-arginine concentration. Elevating L-arginine levels induced global metabolic changes including a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in activated T cells and promoted the generation of central memory-like cells endowed with higher survival capacity and, in a mouse model, anti-tumor activity. Proteome-wide probing of structural alterations, validated by the analysis of knockout T cell clones, identified three transcriptional regulators (BAZ1B, PSIP1, and TSN) that sensed L-arginine levels and promoted T cell survival. Thus, intracellular L-arginine concentrations directly impact the metabolic fitness and survival capacity of T cells that are crucial for anti-tumor responses.","Geiger, Roger;Rieckmann, Jan C;Wolf, Tobias;Basso, Camilla;Feng, Yuehan;Fuhrer, Tobias;Kogadeeva, Maria;Picotti, Paola;Meissner, Felix;Mann, Matthias;Zamboni, Nicola;Sallusto, Federica;Lanzavecchia, Antonio"
27693353,2016,Cell,Engineering T Cells with Customized Therapeutic Response Programs Using Synthetic Notch Receptors.,"Redirecting T cells to attack cancer using engineered chimeric receptors provides powerful new therapeutic capabilities. However, the effectiveness of therapeutic T cells is constrained by the endogenous T cell response: certain facets of natural response programs can be toxic, whereas other responses, such as the ability to overcome tumor immunosuppression, are absent. Thus, the efficacy and safety of therapeutic cells could be improved if we could custom sculpt immune cell responses. Synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors induce transcriptional activation in response to recognition of user-specified antigens. We show that synNotch receptors can be used to sculpt custom response programs in primary T cells: they can drive a la carte cytokine secretion profiles, biased T cell differentiation, and local delivery of non-native therapeutic payloads, such as antibodies, in response to antigen. SynNotch T cells can thus be used as a general platform to recognize and remodel local microenvironments associated with diverse diseases.","Roybal, Kole T;Williams, Jasper Z;Morsut, Leonardo;Rupp, Levi J;Kolinko, Isabel;Choe, Joseph H;Walker, Whitney J;McNally, Krista A;Lim, Wendell A"

Anti-CTLA-4 enhances T cell responses, including production of IFN-γ, which is a critical cytokine for host immune responses. However, the role of IFN-γ signaling in tumor cells in the setting of anti-CTLA-4 therapy remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that patients identified as non-responders to anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) have tumors with genomic defects in IFN-γ pathway genes. Furthermore, mice bearing melanoma tumors with knockdown of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) have impaired tumor rejection upon anti-CTLA-4 therapy. These data highlight that loss of the IFN-γ signaling pathway is associated with primary resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy.

27662089,2016,Cell,Germline NLRP1 Mutations Cause Skin Inflammatory and Cancer Susceptibility Syndromes via Inflammasome Activation.,"Inflammasome complexes function as key innate immune effectors that trigger inflammation in response to pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Here, we report that germline mutations in the inflammasome sensor NLRP1 cause two overlapping skin disorders: multiple self-healing palmoplantar carcinoma (MSPC) and familial keratosis lichenoides chronica (FKLC). We find that NLRP1 is the most prominent inflammasome sensor in human skin, and all pathogenic NLRP1 mutations are gain-of-function alleles that predispose to inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, NLRP1 mutations lead to increased self-oligomerization by disrupting the PYD and LRR domains, which are essential in maintaining NLRP1 as an inactive monomer. Primary keratinocytes from patients experience spontaneous inflammasome activation and paracrine IL-1 signaling, which is sufficient to cause skin inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia. Our findings establish a group of non-fever inflammasome disorders, uncover an unexpected auto-inhibitory function for the pyrin domain, and provide the first genetic evidence linking NLRP1 to skin inflammatory syndromes and skin cancer predisposition.","Zhong, Franklin L;Mamaï, Ons;Sborgi, Lorenzo;Boussofara, Lobna;Hopkins, Richard;Robinson, Kim;Szeverényi, Ildikó;Takeichi, Takuya;Balaji, Reshmaa;Lau, Aristotle;Tye, Hazel;Roy, Keya;Bonnard, Carine;Ahl, Patricia J;Jones, Leigh Ann;Baker, Paul J;Lacina, Lukas;Otsuka, Atsushi;Fournie, Pierre R;Malecaze, François;Lane, E Birgitte;Akiyama, Masashi;Kabashima, Kenji;Connolly, John E;Masters, Seth L;Soler, Vincent J;Omar, Salma Samir;McGrath, John A;Nedelcu, Roxana;Gribaa, Moez;Denguezli, Mohamed;Saad, Ali;Hiller, Sebastian;Reversade, Bruno"

An integrated platform combining in vivo maintenance of these PDTXs along with short-term cultures of PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) was optimized. Remarkably, the intra-tumor genomic clonal architecture present in the originating breast cancers was mostly preserved upon serial passaging in xenografts and in short-term cultured PDTCs. We assessed drug responses in PDTCs on a high-throughput platform and validated several ex vivo responses in vivo.

Therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent a powerful treatment strategy. We leveraged the observation that the majority of AML, despite their genetically heterogeneity, share in the expression of HoxA9, a gene normally downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Using a conditional HoxA9 model system, we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen and defined compounds that overcame differentiation blockade. Target identification led to the unanticipated discovery that inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enables myeloid differentiation in human and mouse AML models. In vivo, DHODH inhibitors reduced leukemic cell burden, decreased levels of leukemia-initiating cells, and improved survival. These data demonstrate the role of DHODH as a metabolic regulator of differentiation and point to its inhibition as a strategy for overcoming differentiation blockade in AML.","Sykes, David B;Kfoury, Youmna S;Mercier, François E;Wawer, Mathias J;Law, Jason M;Haynes, Mark K;Lewis, Timothy A;Schajnovitz, Amir;Jain, Esha;Lee, Dongjun;Meyer, Hanna;Pierce, Kerry A;Tolliday, Nicola J;Waller, Anna;Ferrara, Steven J;Eheim, Ashley L;Stoeckigt, Detlef;Maxcy, Katrina L;Cobert, Julien M;Bachand, Jacqueline;Szekely, Brian A;Mukherjee, Siddhartha;Sklar, Larry A;Kotz, Joanne D;Clish, Clary B;Sadreyev, Ruslan I;Clemons, Paul A;Janzer, Andreas;Schreiber, Stuart L;Scadden, David T"

We identified a uniquely activated γδT cell population, which constituted ∼40% of tumor-infiltrating T cells in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Recruitment and activation of γδT cells was contingent on diverse chemokine signals. Deletion, depletion, or blockade of γδT cell recruitment was protective against PDA and resulted in increased infiltration, activation, and Th1 polarization of αβT cells. Although αβT cells were dispensable to outcome in PDA, they became indispensable mediators of tumor protection upon γδT cell ablation. PDA-infiltrating γδT cells expressed high levels of exhaustion ligands and thereby negated adaptive anti-tumor immunity. Blockade of PD-L1 in γδT cells enhanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell infiltration and immunogenicity and induced tumor protection suggesting that γδT cells are critical sources of immune-suppressive checkpoint ligands in PDA. We describe γδT cells as central regulators of effector T cell activation in cancer via novel cross-talk.","Daley, Donnele;Zambirinis, Constantinos Pantelis;Seifert, Lena;Akkad, Neha;Mohan, Navyatha;Werba, Gregor;Barilla, Rocky;Torres-Hernandez, Alejandro;Hundeyin, Mautin;Mani, Vishnu Raj Kumar;Avanzi, Antonina;Tippens, Daniel;Narayanan, Rajkishen;Jang, Jung-Eun;Newman, Elliot;Pillarisetty, Venu Gopal;Dustin, Michael Loran;Bar-Sagi, Dafna;Hajdu, Cristina;Miller, George"
27565343,2016,Cell,Multi-organ Mapping of Cancer Risk.,"Cancers are distributed unevenly across the body, but the importance of cell intrinsic factors such as stem cell function in determining organ cancer risk is unknown. Therefore, we used Cre-recombination of conditional lineage tracing, oncogene, and tumor suppressor alleles to define populations of stem and non-stem cells in mouse organs and test their life-long susceptibility to tumorigenesis. We show that tumor incidence is determined by the life-long generative capacity of mutated cells. This relationship held true in the presence of multiple genotypes and regardless of developmental stage, strongly supporting the notion that stem cells dictate organ cancer risk. Using the liver as a model system, we further show that damage-induced activation of stem cell function markedly increases cancer risk. Therefore, we propose that a combination of stem cell mutagenesis and extrinsic factors that enhance the proliferation of these cell populations, creates a ""perfect storm"" that ultimately determines organ cancer risk.

27565342,2016,Cell,Oxygen Sensing by T Cells Establishes an Immunologically Tolerant Metastatic Niche.,"Cancer cells must evade immune responses at distant sites to establish metastases. The lung is a frequent site for metastasis. We hypothesized that lung-specific immunoregulatory mechanisms create an immunologically permissive environment for tumor colonization. We found that T-cell-intrinsic expression of the oxygen-sensing prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) proteins is required to maintain local tolerance against innocuous antigens in the lung but powerfully licenses colonization by circulating tumor cells. PHD proteins limit pulmonary type helper (Th)-1 responses, promote CD4(+)-regulatory T (Treg) cell induction, and restrain CD8(+) T cell effector function. Tumor colonization is accompanied by PHD-protein-dependent induction of pulmonary Treg cells and suppression of IFN-γ-dependent tumor clearance. T-cell-intrinsic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PHD proteins limits tumor colonization of the lung and improves the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy.

Using Tied Diffusion through Interacting Events (TieDIE), we integrated differentially expressed master transcriptional regulators, functionally mutated genes, and differentially activated kinases in CRPC tissues to synthesize a robust signaling network consisting of druggable kinase pathways. Using MSigDB hallmark gene sets, six major signaling pathways with phosphorylation of several key residues were significantly enriched in CRPC tumors after incorporation of phosphoproteomic data. Individual autopsy profiles developed using these hallmarks revealed clinically relevant pathway information potentially suitable for patient stratification and targeted therapies in late stage prostate cancer. Here, we describe phosphorylation-based cancer hallmarks using integrated personalized signatures (pCHIPS) that shed light on the diversity of activated signaling pathways in metastatic CRPC while providing an integrative, pathway-based reference for drug prioritization in individual patients.

We isolated pure populations of cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from a genetically engineered mouse model of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to investigate the mechanisms that drive the metastatic spread of this lethal cancer. Genome-wide characterization of chromatin accessibility revealed the opening of large numbers of distal regulatory elements across the genome during metastatic progression. These changes correlate with copy number amplification of the Nfib locus, and differentially accessible sites were highly enriched for Nfib transcription factor binding sites. Nfib is necessary and sufficient to increase chromatin accessibility at a large subset of the intergenic regions.

Integrating our proteomic measurements with the genomic data yielded a number of insights into disease, such as how different copy-number alternations influence the proteome, the proteins associated with chromosomal instability, the sets of signaling pathways that diverse genome rearrangements converge on, and the ones most associated with short overall survival. Specific protein acetylations associated with homologous recombination deficiency suggest a potential means for stratifying patients for therapy.

Intriguingly, TM4SF1 couples the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 to the cortical adaptor syntenin 2 and, hence, to PKCα. The latter kinase phosphorylates and activates JAK2, leading to the activation of STAT3. This non-canonical mechanism of signaling induces the expression of SOX2 and NANOG; sustains the manifestation of cancer stem cell traits; and drives metastatic reactivation in the lung, bone, and brain.

Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1-constituting an ""inducible"" pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.

Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset with a poor prognosis, representing 30%-40% of human PDAC, characterized by reduced SIRT6 expression and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth. Thus, we identify SIRT6 as an important PDAC tumor suppressor and uncover the Lin28b pathway as a potential therapeutic target in a molecularly defined PDAC subset. PAPERCLIP.

The clock is remarkably plastic and adapts to exogenous ""zeitgebers,"" such as light and nutrition. How a pathological condition in a given tissue influences systemic circadian homeostasis in other tissues remains an unanswered question of conceptual and biomedical importance. Here, we show that lung adenocarcinoma operates as an endogenous reorganizer of circadian metabolism. High-throughput transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed unique signatures of transcripts and metabolites cycling exclusively in livers of tumor-bearing mice. Remarkably, lung cancer has no effect on the core clock but rather reprograms hepatic metabolism through altered pro-inflammatory response via the STAT3-Socs3 pathway. This results in disruption of AKT, AMPK, and SREBP signaling, leading to altered insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Thus, lung adenocarcinoma functions as a potent endogenous circadian organizer (ECO), which rewires the pathophysiological dimension of a distal tissue such as the liver. PAPERCLIP.

Here, we show that fibroblasts diminish nuclear accumulation of platinum in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. We demonstrate that glutathione and cysteine released by fibroblasts contribute to this resistance. CD8(+) T cells abolish the resistance by altering glutathione and cystine metabolism in fibroblasts. CD8(+) T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)γ controls fibroblast glutathione and cysteine through upregulation of gamma-glutamyltransferases and transcriptional repression of system xc(-) cystine and glutamate antiporter via the JAK/STAT1 pathway. The presence of stromal fibroblasts and CD8(+) T cells is negatively and positively associated with ovarian cancer patient survival, respectively. Thus, our work uncovers a mode of action for effector T cells: they abrogate stromal-mediated chemoresistance.

By combining cell-specific proteome labeling with multivariate phosphoproteomics, we analyzed heterocellular KRAS(G12D) signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Tumor cell KRAS(G12D) engages heterotypic fibroblasts, which subsequently instigate reciprocal signaling in the tumor cells. Reciprocal signaling employs additional kinases and doubles the number of regulated signaling nodes from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D). Consequently, reciprocal KRAS(G12D) produces a tumor cell phosphoproteome and total proteome that is distinct from cell-autonomous KRAS(G12D) alone. Reciprocal signaling regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and increases mitochondrial capacity via an IGF1R/AXL-AKT axis.

Loss of RACK7 or KDM5C results in overactivation of enhancers, characterized by the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, together with increased transcription of eRNAs and nearby genes. Furthermore, loss of RACK7 or KDM5C leads to de-repression of S100A oncogenes and various cancer-related phenotypes. Our findings reveal a RACK7/KDM5C-regulated, dynamic interchange between histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at active enhancers, representing an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity.

Here, we identify RANBP2 (also known as NUP358) as essential for survival of BRAF-like, but not for non-BRAF-like, CC cells. Suppression of RANBP2 results in mitotic defects only in BRAF-like CC cells, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, RANBP2 silencing reduces microtubule outgrowth from the kinetochores, thereby inducing spindle perturbations, providing an explanation for the observed mitotic defects.

LCC cells show stem-cell-like characteristics and express SOX2 and SOX9 transcription factors, which are essential for their survival in host organs under immune surveillance and for metastatic outgrowth under permissive conditions. Through expression of the WNT inhibitor DKK1, LCC cells self-impose a slow-cycling state with broad downregulation of ULBP ligands for NK cells and evasion of NK-cell-mediated clearance. By expressing a Sox-dependent stem-like state and actively silencing WNT signaling, LCC cells can enter quiescence and evade innate immunity to remain latent for extended periods.

We analyzed the somatic mutanomes and transcriptomes of pretreatment melanoma biopsies to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We find that overall high mutational loads associate with improved survival, and tumors from responding patients are enriched for mutations in the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer.

26924578,2016,Cell,Exploiting Temporal Collateral Sensitivity in Tumor Clonal Evolution.,"The prevailing approach to addressing secondary drug resistance in cancer focuses on treating the resistance mechanisms at relapse. However, the dynamic nature of clonal evolution, along with potential fitness costs and cost compensations, may present exploitable vulnerabilities-a notion that we term ""temporal collateral sensitivity."" Using a combined pharmacological screen and drug resistance selection approach in a murine model of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we indeed find that temporal and/or persistent collateral sensitivity to non-classical BCR-ABL1 drugs arises in emergent tumor subpopulations during the evolution of resistance toward initial treatment with BCR-ABL1-targeted inhibitors. We determined the sensitization mechanism via genotypic, phenotypic, signaling, and binding measurements in combination with computational models and demonstrated significant overall survival extension in mice. Additional stochastic mathematical models and small-molecule screens extended our insights, indicating the value of focusing on evolutionary trajectories and pharmacological profiles to identify new strategies to treat dynamic tumor vulnerabilities.

26898331,2016,Cell,TGF-β Tumor Suppression through a Lethal EMT.,"TGF-β signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-β mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-β induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-β-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-β-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-β. TGF-β-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-β tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network.

26830879,2016,Cell,Precision Tumor Recognition by T Cells With Combinatorial Antigen-Sensing Circuits.,"T cells can be re-directed to kill cancer cells using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs). This approach, however, is constrained by the rarity of tumor-specific single antigens. Targeting antigens also found on bystander tissues can cause life-threatening adverse effects. A powerful way to enhance ON-target activity of therapeutic T cells is to engineer them to require combinatorial antigens. Here, we engineer a combinatorially activated T cell circuit in which a synthetic Notch receptor for one antigen induces the expression of a CAR for a second antigen. These dual-receptor AND-gate T cells are only armed and activated in the presence of dual antigen tumor cells. These T cells show precise therapeutic discrimination in vivo-sparing single antigen ""bystander"" tumors while efficiently clearing combinatorial antigen ""disease"" tumors. This type of precision dual-receptor circuit opens the door to immune recognition of a wider range of tumors.

Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations are associated with increased telomere length. Recent advances in glioma classification based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular subsets.

26806130,2016,Cell,Cancer Immunosurveillance by Tissue-Resident Innate Lymphoid Cells and Innate-like T Cells.,"Malignancy can be suppressed by the immune system in a process termed immunosurveillance. However, to what extent immunosurveillance occurs in spontaneous cancers and the composition of participating cell types remains obscure. Here, we show that cell transformation triggers a tissue-resident lymphocyte response in oncogene-induced murine cancer models. Non-circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes, derived from innate, T cell receptor (TCR)αβ, and TCRγδ lineages, expand in early tumors. Characterized by high expression of NK1.1, CD49a, and CD103, these cells share a gene-expression signature distinct from those of conventional NK cells, T cells, and invariant NKT cells. Generation of these lymphocytes is dependent on the cytokine IL-15, but not the transcription factor Nfil3 that is required for the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, and IL-15 deficiency, but not Nfil3 deficiency, results in accelerated tumor growth. These findings reveal a tumor-elicited immunosurveillance mechanism that engages unconventional type-1-like innate lymphoid cells and type 1 innate-like T cells.","Dadi, Saïda;Chhangawala, Sagar;Whitlock, Benjamin M;Franklin, Ruth A;Luo, Chong T;Oh, Soyoung A;Toure, Ahmed;Pritykin, Yuri;Huse, Morgan;Leslie, Christina S;Li, Ming O"

26687355,2015,Cell,Chromothripsis and Kataegis Induced by Telomere Crisis.,"Telomere crisis occurs during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve leads to frequent telomere fusions. The resulting dicentric chromosomes have been proposed to drive genome instability. Here, we examine the fate of dicentric human chromosomes in telomere crisis. We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into 50-200 μm chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3-20 hr after anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the cytoplasmic 3' nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis.

We postulate that TNBC might be highly dependent on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of transcription. Utilizing kinase inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we show here that triple-negative but not hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells are exceptionally dependent on CDK7, a transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase. TNBC cells are unique in their dependence on this transcriptional CDK and suffer apoptotic cell death upon CDK7 inhibition. An ""Achilles cluster"" of TNBC-specific genes is especially sensitive to CDK7 inhibition and frequently associated with super-enhancers. We conclude that CDK7 mediates transcriptional addiction to a vital cluster of genes in TNBC and CDK7 inhibition may be a useful therapy for this challenging cancer.

These changes inhibit antigen-primed cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell activity, permitting growth of FAK-expressing tumors. Mechanistically, nuclear FAK is associated with chromatin and exists in complex with transcription factors and their upstream regulators that control Ccl5 expression. Furthermore, FAK's immuno-modulatory nuclear activities may be specific to cancerous squamous epithelial cells, as normal keratinocytes do not have nuclear FAK. Finally, we show that a small-molecule FAK kinase inhibitor, VS-4718, which is currently in clinical development, also drives depletion of Tregs and promotes a CD8(+) T cell-mediated anti-tumor response.

Anti-Fn14 antibodies prevented tumor-induced inflammation and loss of fat and muscle mass. Fn14 signaling in the tumor, rather than host, is responsible for inducing this cachexia because tumors in Fn14- and TWEAK-deficient hosts developed cachexia that was comparable to that of wild-type mice.

Transcriptomic alterations across resistant tumors were highly recurrent, in contrast to mutations, and were frequently correlated with differential methylation of tumor cell-intrinsic CpG sites. We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance. Importantly, high intra-tumoral cytolytic T cell inflammation prior to MAPKi therapy preceded CD8 T cell deficiency/exhaustion and loss of antigen presentation in half of disease-progressive melanomas, suggesting cross-resistance to salvage anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.

Here, we show that the growth of tumors formed by mutant Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells in an immunocompetent host requires their production of prostaglandin E2, which suppresses immunity and fuels tumor-promoting inflammation. Genetic ablation of cyclooxygenases (COX) or prostaglandin E synthases in Braf(V600E) mouse melanoma cells, as well as in Nras(G12D) melanoma or in breast or colorectal cancer cells, renders them susceptible to immune control and provokes a shift in the tumor inflammatory profile toward classic anti-cancer immune pathways. This mouse COX-dependent inflammatory signature is remarkably conserved in human cutaneous melanoma biopsies, arguing for COX activity as a driver of immune suppression across species. Pre-clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of COX synergizes with anti-PD-1 blockade in inducing eradication of tumors, implying that COX inhibitors could be useful adjuvants for immune-based therapies in cancer patients.

We propose that a glucose-poor tumor microenvironment limits aerobic glycolysis in tumor-infiltrating T cells, which suppresses tumoricidal effector functions. We discovered a new role for the glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in sustaining T cell receptor-mediated Ca(2+)-NFAT signaling and effector functions by repressing sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity. Tumor-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells could be metabolically reprogrammed by increasing PEP production through overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), which bolstered effector functions. Moreover, PCK1-overexpressing T cells restricted tumor growth and prolonged the survival of melanoma-bearing mice.

We show that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic ""regressor"" tumor is sufficient to override the protective ability of T cells to control tumor growth. We also show that checkpoint blockade antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which are used clinically, restore glucose in tumor microenvironment, permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-γ production. Furthermore, we found that blocking PD-L1 directly on tumors dampens glycolysis by inhibiting mTOR activity and decreasing expression of glycolysis enzymes, reflecting a role for PD-L1 in tumor glucose utilization.

In ovarian cancer (OC), DNMTis trigger cytosolic sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causing a type I interferon response and apoptosis. Knocking down dsRNA sensors TLR3 and MAVS reduces this response 2-fold and blocking interferon beta or its receptor abrogates it. Upregulation of hypermethylated endogenous retrovirus (ERV) genes accompanies the response and ERV overexpression activates the response. Basal levels of ERV and viral defense gene expression significantly correlate in primary OC and the latter signature separates primary samples for multiple tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into low versus high expression groups.

Using a combination of experimental and bioinformatics analyses in colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that low-dose 5-AZA-CdR targets colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) by inducing viral mimicry. This is associated with induction of dsRNAs derived at least in part from endogenous retroviral elements, activation of the MDA5/MAVS RNA recognition pathway, and downstream activation of IRF7. Indeed, disruption of virus recognition pathways, by individually knocking down MDA5, MAVS, or IRF7, inhibits the ability of 5-AZA-CdR to target colorectal CICs and significantly decreases 5-AZA-CdR long-term growth effects. Moreover, transfection of dsRNA into CICs can mimic the effects of 5-AZA-CdR.

Whether infection promotes B cell lymphoma, and if so by which mechanism, remains unknown. To investigate the relationship between parasitic disease and lymphomagenesis, we used Plasmodium chabaudi (Pc) to produce chronic malaria infection in mice. Pc induces prolonged expansion of germinal centers (GCs), unique compartments in which B cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA mutator. GC B cells elicited during Pc infection suffer widespread DNA damage, leading to chromosome translocations. Although infection does not change the overall rate, it modifies lymphomagenesis to favor mature B cell lymphomas that are AID dependent and show chromosome translocations. Thus, malaria infection favors mature B cell cancers by eliciting protracted AID expression in GC B cells.

Here, we perform a cell-line-based screen and identify strong synergistic interactions between cell-cycle checkpoint-abrogating Chk1- and MK2 inhibitors, specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-driven cells. Mechanistically, we show that KRAS-mutant cancer displays intrinsic genotoxic stress, leading to tonic Chk1- and MK2 activity. We demonstrate that simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition leads to mitotic catastrophe in KRAS-mutant cells. This actionable synergistic interaction is validated using xenograft models, as well as distinct Kras- or Braf-driven autochthonous murine cancer models. Lastly, we show that combined checkpoint inhibition induces apoptotic cell death in KRAS- or BRAF-mutant tumor cells directly isolated from patients.

Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators was largely intact in Aim2-deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM2. Susceptibility of Aim2-deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with healthy wild-type mice.

By generating an Eif4e haploinsufficient mouse, we found that a 50% reduction in eIF4E expression, while compatible with normal development and global protein synthesis, significantly impeded cellular transformation. Genome-wide translational profiling uncovered a translational program induced by oncogenic transformation and revealed a critical role for the dose of eIF4E, specifically in translating a network of mRNAs enriched for a unique 5' UTR signature. In particular, we demonstrate that the dose of eIF4E is essential for translating mRNAs that regulate reactive oxygen species, fueling transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo.

Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

We establish a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis suggests that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced by tumor stroma immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.

To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the re-establishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response factor XBP1 promotes intrinsic tumor growth directly, but whether it also regulates the host anti-tumor immune response is not known. Here we show that constitutive activation of XBP1 in tumor-associated DCs (tDCs) drives ovarian cancer (OvCa) progression by blunting anti-tumor immunity. XBP1 activation, fueled by lipid peroxidation byproducts, induced a triglyceride biosynthetic program in tDCs leading to abnormal lipid accumulation and subsequent inhibition of tDC capacity to support anti-tumor T cells. Accordingly, DC-specific XBP1 deletion or selective nanoparticle-mediated XBP1 silencing in tDCs restored their immunostimulatory activity in situ and extended survival by evoking protective type 1 anti-tumor responses.

To determine how such responses are generated, we utilized a murine model of an anti-tumor vaccinal effect against a model neoantigen. We demonstrate that FcγR expression by CD11c(+) antigen-presenting cells is required to generate anti-tumor T cell responses upon ADCC-mediated tumor clearance. Using FcγR-humanized mice, we demonstrate that anti-tumor human (h)IgG1 must engage hFcγRIIIA on macrophages to mediate ADCC, but also engage hFcγRIIA, the sole hFcγR expressed by human dendritic cells (DCs), to generate a potent vaccinal effect. Thus, while next-generation anti-tumor antibodies with enhanced binding to only hFcγRIIIA are now in clinical use, ideal anti-tumor antibodies must be optimized for both cytotoxic effects as well as hFcγRIIA engagement on DCs to stimulate long-term anti-tumor cellular immunity.

25957686,2015,Cell,Endogenous tRNA-Derived Fragments Suppress Breast Cancer Progression via YBX1 Displacement.,"Upon exposure to stress, tRNAs are enzymatically cleaved, yielding distinct classes of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), yielding distinct classes of tRFs. We identify a novel class of tRFs derived from tRNA(Glu), tRNA(Asp), tRNA(Gly), and tRNA(Tyr) that, upon induction, suppress the stability of multiple oncogenic transcripts in breast cancer cells by displacing their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) from the RNA-binding protein YBX1. This mode of post-transcriptional silencing is sequence specific, as these fragments all share a common motif that matches the YBX1 recognition sequence. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, using anti-sense locked-nucleic acids (LNAs) and synthetic RNA mimetics, respectively, revealed that these fragments suppress growth under serum-starvation, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis by breast cancer cells. Highly metastatic cells evade this tumor-suppressive pathway by attenuating the induction of these tRFs.

By using optogenetic control of cortical neuronal activity in a patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma xenograft model, we demonstrate that active neurons similarly promote HGG proliferation and growth in vivo. Conditioned medium from optogenetically stimulated cortical slices promoted proliferation of pediatric and adult patient-derived HGG cultures, indicating secretion of activity-regulated mitogen(s). The synaptic protein neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) was identified as the leading candidate mitogen, and soluble NLGN3 was sufficient and necessary to promote robust HGG cell proliferation. NLGN3 induced PI3K-mTOR pathway activity and feedforward expression of NLGN3 in glioma cells. NLGN3 expression levels in human HGG negatively correlated with patient overall survival. These findings indicate the important role of active neurons in the brain tumor microenvironment and identify secreted NLGN3 as an unexpected mechanism promoting neuronal activity-regulated cancer growth.","Venkatesh, Humsa S;Johung, Tessa B;Caretti, Viola;Noll, Alyssa;Tang, Yujie;Nagaraja, Surya;Gibson, Erin M;Mount, Christopher W;Polepalli, Jai;Mitra, Siddhartha S;Woo, Pamelyn J;Malenka, Robert C;Vogel, Hannes;Bredel, Markus;Mallick, Parag;Monje, Michelle"

Here, we established patient-derived iPSCs from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) family and investigated the role of mutant p53 in the development of osteosarcoma (OS). LFS iPSC-derived osteoblasts (OBs) recapitulated OS features including defective osteoblastic differentiation as well as tumorigenic ability. Systematic analyses revealed that the expression of genes enriched in LFS-derived OBs strongly correlated with decreased time to tumor recurrence and poor patient survival. Furthermore, LFS OBs exhibited impaired upregulation of the imprinted gene H19 during osteogenesis. Restoration of H19 expression in LFS OBs facilitated osteoblastic differentiation and repressed tumorigenic potential. By integrating human imprinted gene network (IGN) into functional genomic analyses, we found that H19 mediates suppression of LFS-associated OS through the IGN component DECORIN (DCN).

One area stems from a detailed knowledge of mutations that activate or inactivate signaling pathways that drive cancer development. This work triggered the development of targeted therapies that lead to clinical responses in the majority of patients bearing the targeted mutation, although responses are often of limited duration. In the second front are the advances in molecular immunology that unveiled the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses. These developments led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints to unleash anti-tumor T cell responses, resulting in durable long-lasting responses but only in a fraction of patients. In this Review, we discuss the evolution of research in these two areas and propose that intercrossing them and increasing funding to guide research of combination of agents represent a path forward for the development of curative therapies for the majority of cancer patients.","Sharma, Padmanee;Allison, James P"

In vitro experiments demonstrated that pseudogenes contribute to cell transformation through several mechanisms. However, in vivo evidence for a causal role of pseudogenes in cancer development is lacking. Here, we report that mice engineered to overexpress either the full-length murine B-Raf pseudogene Braf-rs1 or its pseudo ""CDS"" or ""3' UTR"" develop an aggressive malignancy resembling human diffuse large B cell lymphoma. We show that Braf-rs1 and its human ortholog, BRAFP1, elicit their oncogenic activity, at least in part, as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that elevate BRAF expression and MAPK activation in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we find that transcriptional or genomic aberrations of BRAFP1 occur frequently in multiple human cancers, including B cell lymphomas.

The mutant cell pool rapidly generates metastases when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases and late-stage primary tumors were found to target a small set of genes, suggesting that specific loss-of-function mutations drive tumor growth and metastasis. Individual sgRNAs and a small pool of 624 sgRNAs targeting the top-scoring genes from the primary screen dramatically accelerate metastasis.

To satisfy this unmet need, we developed the Dynamic BH3 Profiling technique to measure early changes in net pro-apoptotic signaling at the mitochondrion (""priming"") induced by chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells, not requiring prolonged ex vivo culture.

However, sources and mechanisms that generate tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistant cell population are still unfolding. Here, we devise a functional reporter system to lineage trace and/or genetic ablate signaling in TGF-β-activated squamous cell carcinoma stem cells (SCC-SCs). Dissecting TGF-β's impact on malignant progression, we demonstrate that TGF-β concentrating near tumor-vasculature generates heterogeneity in TGF-β signaling at tumor-stroma interface and bestows slower-cycling properties to neighboring SCC-SCs. While non-responding progenies proliferate faster and accelerate tumor growth, TGF-β-responding progenies invade, aberrantly differentiate, and affect gene expression. Intriguingly, TGF-β-responding SCC-SCs show increased protection against anti-cancer drugs, but slower-cycling alone does not confer survival. Rather, TGF-β transcriptionally activates p21, which stabilizes NRF2, thereby markedly enhancing glutathione metabolism and diminishing effectiveness of anti-cancer therapeutics. Together, these findings establish a surprising non-genetic paradigm for TGF-β signaling in fueling heterogeneity in SCC-SCs, tumor characteristics, and drug resistance.

Here, we uncover a distinct pathway of telomere-driven genome instability, specifically occurring in cells that maintain telomeres with the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism. We show that, in these cells, telomeric DNA is added to multiple discrete sites throughout the genome, corresponding to regions regulated by NR2C/F transcription factors. These proteins drive local telomere DNA addition by recruiting telomeric chromatin. This mechanism, which we name targeted telomere insertion (TTI), generates potential common fragile sites that destabilize the genome. We propose that TTI driven by NR2C/F proteins contributes to the formation of complex karyotypes in ALT tumors.","Marzec, Paulina;Armenise, Claudia;Pérot, Gaëlle;Roumelioti, Fani-Marlen;Basyuk, Eugenia;Gagos, Sarantis;Chibon, Frédéric;Déjardin, Jérôme"

The phenotypic diversity resulting from karyotypic diversity endows the cell population with superior adaptability. We show here, using a combination of experimental data and a general stochastic model, that the degree of phenotypic variation, thus evolvability, escalates with the degree of overall growth suppression. Such scaling likely explains the challenge of treating aneuploidy diseases with a single stress-inducing agent. Instead, we propose the design of an ""evolutionary trap"" (ET) targeting both karyotypic diversity and fitness. This strategy entails a selective condition ""channeling"" a karyotypically divergent population into one with a predominant and predictably drugable karyotypic feature. We provide a proof-of-principle case in budding yeast and demonstrate the potential efficacy of this strategy toward aneuploidy-based azole resistance in Candida albicans.

25679764,2015,Cell,MEK guards proteome stability and inhibits tumor-suppressive amyloidogenesis via HSF1.,"Signaling through RAS/MAP kinase pathway is central to biology. ERK has long been perceived as the only substrate for MEK. Here, we report that HSF1, the master regulator of the proteotoxic stress response, is a new MEK substrate. Beyond mediating cell-environment interactions, the MEK-HSF1 regulation impacts malignancy. In tumor cells, MEK blockade inactivates HSF1 and thereby provokes proteomic chaos, presented as protein destabilization, aggregation, and, strikingly, amyloidogenesis. Unlike their non-transformed counterparts, tumor cells are particularly susceptible to proteomic perturbation and amyloid induction. Amyloidogenesis is tumor suppressive, reducing in vivo melanoma growth and contributing to the potent anti-neoplastic effects of proteotoxic stressors. Our findings unveil a key biological function of the oncogenic RAS-MEK signaling in guarding proteostasis and suppressing amyloidogenesis. Thus, proteomic instability is an intrinsic feature of malignant state, and disrupting the fragile tumor proteostasis to promote amyloidogenesis may be a feasible therapeutic strategy.","Tang, Zijian;Dai, Siyuan;He, Yishu;Doty, Rosalinda A;Shultz, Leonard D;Sampson, Stephen Byers;Dai, Chengkai"
25679763,2015,Cell,Degradation of AMPK by a cancer-specific ubiquitin ligase.,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master sensor and regulator of cellular energy status. Upon metabolic stress, AMPK suppresses anabolic and promotes catabolic processes to regain energy homeostasis. Cancer cells can occasionally suppress the growth-restrictive AMPK pathway by mutation of an upstream regulatory kinase. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism to suppress AMPK through its ubiquitination and degradation by the cancer-specific MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A6 are highly similar proteins normally expressed only in the male germline but frequently re-activated in human cancers. MAGE-A3/6 are necessary for cancer cell viability and are sufficient to drive tumorigenic properties of non-cancerous cells. Screening for targets of MAGE-A3/6-TRIM28 revealed that it ubiquitinates and degrades AMPKα1. This leads to inhibition of autophagy, activation of mTOR signaling, and hypersensitization to AMPK agonists, such as metformin. These findings elucidate a germline mechanism commonly hijacked in cancer to suppress AMPK.

PTX3 activates and regulates the Complement cascade by interacting with C1q and with Factor H. PTX3 deficiency was associated with increased susceptibility to mesenchymal and epithelial carcinogenesis. Increased susceptibility of Ptx3(-/-) mice was associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration, cytokine production, angiogenesis, and Trp53 mutations. Correlative evidence, gene-targeted mice, and pharmacological blocking experiments indicated that PTX3 deficiency resulted in amplification of Complement activation, CCL2 production, and tumor-promoting macrophage recruitment. PTX3 expression was epigenetically regulated in selected human tumors (e.g., leiomyosarcomas and colorectal cancer) by methylation of the promoter region and of a putative enhancer. Thus, PTX3, an effector molecule belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity, acts as an extrinsic oncosuppressor gene in mouse and man by regulating Complement-dependent, macrophage-sustained, tumor-promoting inflammation.","Bonavita, Eduardo;Gentile, Stefania;Rubino, Marcello;Maina, Virginia;Papait, Roberto;Kunderfranco, Paolo;Greco, Carolina;Feruglio, Francesca;Molgora, Martina;Laface, Ilaria;Tartari, Silvia;Doni, Andrea;Pasqualini, Fabio;Barbati, Elisa;Basso, Gianluca;Galdiero, Maria Rosaria;Nebuloni, Manuela;Roncalli, Massimo;Colombo, Piergiuseppe;Laghi, Luigi;Lambris, John D;Jaillon, Sébastien;Garlanda, Cecilia;Mantovani, Alberto"

These miRNAs convergently target creatine kinase, brain-type (CKB), which phosphorylates the metabolite creatine, to generate phosphocreatine. CKB is released into the extracellular space by metastatic cells encountering hepatic hypoxia and catalyzes production of phosphocreatine, which is imported through the SLC6A8 transporter and used to generate ATP—fueling metastatic survival. Combinatorial therapeutic viral delivery of miR-551a and miR-483-5p through single-dose adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery significantly suppressed colon cancer metastasis, as did CKB inhibition with a small-molecule inhibitor. Importantly, human liver metastases express higher CKB and SLC6A8 levels and reduced miR-551a/miR-483 levels relative to primary tumors.

The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B.

Orthotopically transplanted neoplastic organoids recapitulate the full spectrum of tumor development by forming early-grade neoplasms that progress to locally invasive and metastatic carcinomas.

Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely noncoding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent antiviral signaling. In parallel, stromal cells also activate NOTCH3 on BrCa cells. The paracrine antiviral and juxtacrine NOTCH3 pathways converge as STAT1 facilitates transcriptional responses to NOTCH3 and expands therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells. Primary human and/or mouse BrCa analysis support the role of antiviral/NOTCH3 pathways in NOTCH signaling and stroma-mediated resistance, which is abrogated by combination therapy with gamma secretase inhibitors. Thus, stromal cells orchestrate an intricate crosstalk with BrCa cells by utilizing exosomes to instigate antiviral signaling.

The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma.

BCAR4 binding of SNIP1 and PNUTS in response to CCL21 releases the SNIP1's inhibition of p300-dependent histone acetylation, which in turn enables the BCAR4-recruited PNUTS to bind H3K18ac and relieve inhibition of RNA Pol II via activation of the PP1 phosphatase.

BCAR4 expression correlates with advanced breast cancers, and therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR4 strongly suppresses breast cancer metastasis in mouse models. The findings reveal a disease-relevant lncRNA mechanism consisting of both direct coordinated protein recruitment and indirect regulation of transcription factors.

25303533,2014,Cell,Identification of causal genetic drivers of human disease through systems-level analysis of regulatory networks.,"Identification of driver mutations in human diseases is often limited by cohort size and availability of appropriate statistical models. We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in > 50% of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype.

Conversion of quiescent to activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) drives the severe stromal reaction that characterizes PDA. Here, we reveal that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in stroma from human pancreatic tumors and that treatment with the VDR ligand calcipotriol markedly reduced markers of inflammation and fibrosis in pancreatitis and human tumor stroma. We show that VDR acts as a master transcriptional regulator of PSCs to reprise the quiescent state, resulting in induced stromal remodeling, increased intratumoral gemcitabine, reduced tumor volume, and a 57% increase in survival compared to chemotherapy alone. This work describes a molecular strategy through which transcriptional reprogramming of tumor stroma enables chemotherapeutic response and suggests vitamin D priming as an adjunct in PDA therapy.

By deleting enzymes that affect aerobic glycolysis with different potencies, we examine how modulating glucose metabolism specifically affects hematopoietic and leukemic cell populations. We find that a deficiency in the M2 pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM2) reduces the levels of metabolic intermediates important for biosynthesis and impairs progenitor function without perturbing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) deletion significantly inhibits the function of both HSCs and progenitors during hematopoiesis. In contrast, leukemia initiation by transforming alleles putatively affecting either HSCs or progenitors is inhibited in the absence of either PKM2 or LDHA, indicating that the cell-state-specific responses to metabolic manipulation in hematopoiesis do not apply to the setting of leukemia. This finding suggests that fine-tuning the level of glycolysis may be explored therapeutically for treating leukemia while preserving HSC function.

Although rare in the circulation compared with single CTCs, CTC clusters have 23- to 50-fold increased metastatic potential. In patients with breast cancer, single-cell resolution RNA sequencing of CTC clusters and single CTCs, matched within individual blood samples, identifies the cell junction component plakoglobin as highly differentially expressed. In mouse models, knockdown of plakoglobin abrogates CTC cluster formation and suppresses lung metastases. In breast cancer patients, both abundance of CTC clusters and high tumor plakoglobin levels denote adverse outcomes. Thus, CTC clusters are derived from multicellular groupings of primary tumor cells held together through plakoglobin-dependent intercellular adhesion, and though rare, they greatly contribute to the metastatic spread of cancer.","Aceto, Nicola;Bardia, Aditya;Miyamoto, David T;Donaldson, Maria C;Wittner, Ben S;Spencer, Joel A;Yu, Min;Pely, Adam;Engstrom, Amanda;Zhu, Huili;Brannigan, Brian W;Kapur, Ravi;Stott, Shannon L;Shioda, Toshi;Ramaswamy, Sridhar;Ting, David T;Lin, Charles P;Toner, Mehmet;Haber, Daniel A;Maheswaran, Shyamala"

Moreover, loss of p53 facilitates dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes into nestin-positive progenitor-like cells, which are poised to differentiate into hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) or cholangiocarcinomas (CCs) in response to lineage-specific mutations that target Wnt and Notch signaling, respectively.

We report that the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is frequently activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), where it is a potent enabler of malignancy. HSF1 drives a transcriptional program in CAFs that complements, yet is completely different from, the program it drives in adjacent cancer cells. This CAF program is uniquely structured to support malignancy in a non-cell-autonomous way. Two central stromal signaling molecules-TGF-β and SDF1-play a critical role. In early-stage breast and lung cancer, high stromal HSF1 activation is strongly associated with poor patient outcome.

We report that altering the microbiota composition reduces CRC in APC(Min/+)MSH2(-/-) mice, and that a diet reduced in carbohydrates phenocopies this effect. Gut microbes did not induce CRC in these mice through an inflammatory response or the production of DNA mutagens but rather by providing carbohydrate-derived metabolites such as butyrate that fuel hyperproliferation of MSH2(-/-) colon epithelial cells. Further, we provide evidence that the mismatch repair pathway has a role in regulating β-catenin activity and modulating the differentiation of transit-amplifying cells in the colon.

24630730,2014,Cell,Synonymous mutations frequently act as driver mutations in human cancers.,"Synonymous mutations change the sequence of a gene without directly altering the sequence of the encoded protein. Here, we present evidence that these ""silent"" mutations frequently contribute to human cancer. Selection on synonymous mutations in oncogenes is cancer-type specific, and although the functional consequences of cancer-associated synonymous mutations may be diverse, they recurrently alter exonic motifs that regulate splicing and are associated with changes in oncogene splicing in tumors. The p53 tumor suppressor (TP53) also has recurrent synonymous mutations, but, in contrast to those in oncogenes, these are adjacent to splice sites and inactivate them. We estimate that between one in two and one in five silent mutations in oncogenes have been selected, equating to ~6%- 8% of all selected single-nucleotide changes in these genes. In addition, our analyses suggest that dosage-sensitive oncogenes have selected mutations in their 3' UTRs.","Supek, Fran;Miñana, Belén;Valcárcel, Juan;Gabaldón, Toni;Lehner, Ben"

Using genome sequencing, we characterized the somatic evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC initiated by loss of Trp53 and Rb1. We identified alterations in DNA copy number and complex genomic rearrangements and demonstrated a low somatic point mutation frequency in the absence of tobacco mutagens. Alterations targeting the tumor suppressor Pten occurred in the majority of murine SCLC studied, and engineered Pten deletion accelerated murine SCLC and abrogated loss of Chr19 in Trp53; Rb1; Pten compound mutant tumors. Finally, we found evidence for polyclonal and sequential metastatic spread of murine SCLC by comparative sequencing of families of related primary tumors and metastases.

24581498,2014,Cell,Serpins promote cancer cell survival and vascular co-option in brain metastasis.,"Brain metastasis is an ominous complication of cancer, yet most cancer cells that infiltrate the brain die of unknown causes. Here, we identify plasmin from the reactive brain stroma as a defense against metastatic invasion, and plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitory serpins in cancer cells as a shield against this defense. Plasmin suppresses brain metastasis in two ways: by converting membrane-bound astrocytic FasL into a paracrine death signal for cancer cells, and by inactivating the axon pathfinding molecule L1CAM, which metastatic cells express for spreading along brain capillaries and for metastatic outgrowth. Brain metastatic cells from lung cancer and breast cancer express high levels of anti-PA serpins, including neuroserpin and serpin B2, to prevent plasmin generation and its metastasis-suppressive effects. By protecting cancer cells from death signals and fostering vascular co-option, anti-PA serpins provide a unifying mechanism for the initiation of brain metastasis in lung and breast cancers.

We provide pharmacologic, molecular, and genetic evidence establishing the liver-X nuclear hormone receptor (LXR) as a therapeutic target in melanoma. Oral administration of multiple LXR agonists suppressed melanoma invasion, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Molecular and genetic experiments revealed these effects to be mediated by LXRβ, which elicits these outcomes through transcriptional induction of tumoral and stromal apolipoprotein-E (ApoE). LXRβ agonism robustly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis across a diverse mutational spectrum of melanoma lines. LXRβ targeting significantly prolonged animal survival, suppressed the progression of established metastases, and inhibited brain metastatic colonization. Importantly, LXRβ activation displayed melanoma-suppressive cooperativity with the frontline regimens dacarbazine, B-Raf inhibition, and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody and robustly inhibited melanomas that had acquired resistance to B-Raf inhibition or dacarbazine.

24581491,2014,Cell,Hippo signaling regulates microprocessor and links cell-density-dependent miRNA biogenesis to cancer.,"Global downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is commonly observed in human cancers and can have a causative role in tumorigenesis. The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP, the downstream target of the tumor-suppressive Hippo-signaling pathway regulates miRNA biogenesis in a cell-density-dependent manner. At low cell density, nuclear YAP binds and sequesters p72 (DDX17), a regulatory component of the miRNA-processing machinery. At high cell density, Hippo-mediated cytoplasmic retention of YAP facilitates p72 association with Microprocessor and binding to a specific sequence motif in pri-miRNAs. Inactivation of the Hippo pathway or expression of constitutively active YAP causes widespread miRNA suppression in cells and tumors and a corresponding posttranscriptional induction of MYC expression. Thus, the Hippo pathway links contact-inhibition regulation to miRNA biogenesis and may be responsible for the widespread miRNA repression observed in cancer.","Mori, Masaki;Triboulet, Robinson;Mohseni, Morvarid;Schlegelmilch, Karin;Shrestha, Kriti;Camargo, Fernando D;Gregory, Richard I"
24529377,2014,Cell,Glycosylation-dependent lectin-receptor interactions preserve angiogenesis in anti-VEGF refractory tumors.,"The clinical benefit conferred by vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-targeted therapies is variable, and tumors from treated patients eventually reinitiate growth. Here, we identify a glycosylation-dependent pathway that compensates for the absence of cognate ligand and preserves angiogenesis in response to VEGF blockade. Remodeling of the endothelial cell (EC) surface glycome selectively regulated binding of galectin-1 (Gal1), which upon recognition of complex N-glycans on VEGFR2, activated VEGF-like signaling. Vessels within anti-VEGF-sensitive tumors exhibited high levels of α2-6-linked sialic acid, which prevented Gal1 binding. In contrast, anti-VEGF refractory tumors secreted increased Gal1 and their associated vasculature displayed glycosylation patterns that facilitated Gal1-EC interactions. Interruption of β1-6GlcNAc branching in ECs or silencing of tumor-derived Gal1 converted refractory into anti-VEGF-sensitive tumors, whereas elimination of α2-6-linked sialic acid conferred resistance to anti-VEGF. Disruption of the Gal1-N-glycan axis promoted vascular remodeling, immune cell influx and tumor growth inhibition. Thus, targeting glycosylation-dependent lectin-receptor interactions may increase the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment.","Croci, Diego O;Cerliani, Juan P;Dalotto-Moreno, Tomas;Méndez-Huergo, Santiago P;Mascanfroni, Ivan D;Dergan-Dylon, Sebastián;Toscano, Marta A;Caramelo, Julio J;García-Vallejo, Juan J;Ouyang, Jing;Mesri, Enrique A;Junttila, Melissa R;Bais, Carlos;Shipp, Margaret A;Salatino, Mariana;Rabinovich, Gabriel A"

Here, we describe a murine system in which reprogramming factor expression in vivo can be controlled temporally with doxycycline (Dox). Notably, transient expression of reprogramming factors in vivo results in tumor development in various tissues consisting of undifferentiated dysplastic cells exhibiting global changes in DNA methylation patterns. The Dox-withdrawn tumors arising in the kidney share a number of characteristics with Wilms tumor, a common pediatric kidney cancer. We also demonstrate that iPSCs derived from Dox-withdrawn kidney tumor cells give rise to nonneoplastic kidney cells in mice, proving that they have not undergone irreversible genetic transformation.

24485463,2014,Cell,Mathematical modeling of PDGF-driven glioblastoma reveals optimized radiation dosing schedules.,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and malignant primary brain tumors and are aggressively treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite this treatment, recurrence is inevitable and survival has improved minimally over the last 50 years. Recent studies have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model, we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance. These schedules led to superior survival in mice. Our interdisciplinary approach may also be applicable to other human cancer types treated with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for significantly increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic therapy.

Here, we show that select microenvironments can underlie resistance to antibody-based therapy. Using a humanized model of treatment refractory B cell leukemia, we find that infiltration of leukemia cells into the bone marrow rewires the tumor microenvironment to inhibit engulfment of antibody-targeted tumor cells. Resistance to macrophage-mediated killing can be overcome by combination regimens involving therapeutic antibodies and chemotherapy. Specifically, the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide induces an acute secretory activating phenotype (ASAP), releasing CCL4, IL8, VEGF, and TNFα from treated tumor cells. These factors induce macrophage infiltration and phagocytic activity in the bone marrow. Thus, the acute induction of stress-related cytokines can effectively target cancer cells for removal by the innate immune system. This synergistic chemoimmunotherapeutic regimen represents a potent strategy for using conventional anticancer agents to alter the tumor microenvironment and promote the efficacy of targeted therapeutics.","Pallasch, Christian P;Leskov, Ilya;Braun, Christian J;Vorholt, Daniela;Drake, Adam;Soto-Feliciano, Yadira M;Bent, Eric H;Schwamb, Janine;Iliopoulou, Bettina;Kutsch, Nadine;van Rooijen, Nico;Frenzel, Lukas P;Wendtner, Clemens M;Heukamp, Lukas;Kreuzer, Karl Anton;Hallek, Michael;Chen, Jianzhu;Hemann, Michael T"

It remains unclear how different subpopulations of cancer cells contribute to this process. We developed three-dimensional (3D) organoid assays to identify the most invasive cancer cells in primary breast tumors. Collective invasion was led by specialized cancer cells that were defined by their expression of basal epithelial genes, such as cytokeratin-14 (K14) and p63. Furthermore, K14+ cells led collective invasion in the major human breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, luminal cancer cells were observed to convert phenotypically to invasive leaders following induction of basal epithelial genes. Although only a minority of cells within luminal tumors expressed basal epithelial genes, knockdown of either K14 or p63 was sufficient to block collective invasion. Our data reveal that heterotypic interactions between epithelial subpopulations are critical to collective invasion. We suggest that targeting the basal invasive program could limit metastatic progression. ","Cheung, Kevin J;Gabrielson, Edward;Werb, Zena;Ewald, Andrew J"

GR substituted for the androgen receptor (AR) to activate a similar but distinguishable set of target genes and was necessary for maintenance of the resistant phenotype. The GR agonist dexamethasone was sufficient to confer enzalutamide resistance, whereas a GR antagonist restored sensitivity. Acute AR inhibition resulted in GR upregulation in a subset of prostate cancer cells due to relief of AR-mediated feedback repression of GR expression. These findings establish a mechanism of escape from AR blockade through expansion of cells primed to drive AR target genes via an alternative nuclear receptor upon drug exposure.

To confront this challenge, we have applied parallel screening of chemical and genetic perturbations within a panel of molecularly annotated NSCLC lines to identify intervention opportunities tightly linked to molecular response indicators predictive of target sensitivity. Anchoring this analysis on a matched tumor/normal cell model from a lung adenocarcinoma patient identified three distinct target/response-indicator pairings that are represented with significant frequencies (6%-16%) in the patient population.

Early cancer cell dissemination followed by a protracted period of dormancy potentially explains this prevalent clinical behavior. Increasing evidence suggests that the metastasis-initiating cells are cancer stem cells or revert to this functional state upon infiltrating a target organ. Their entry into dormancy and subsequent reactivation are governed by intrinsic programs and by contextual cues, which resemble those regulating the self-renewal capability of adult stem cells. In addition, metastatic cells undergoing reactivation are nursed by specialized extracellular matrix niches, which support positive signals, such as Wnt and Notch, and attenuate negative signals, such as BMP. In spite of significant remaining uncertainties, these findings provide a framework to understand the logic of metastatic dormancy and reactivation and open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

By analyzing >8,200 tumor-normal pairs, we provide statistical evidence suggesting that many more genes possess cancer driver properties than anticipated, forming a continuum of oncogenic potential. Integrating our driver predictions with information on somatic copy number alterations, we find that the distribution and potency of TSGs (STOP genes), OGs, and essential genes (GO genes) on chromosomes can predict the complex patterns of aneuploidy and copy number variation characteristic of cancer genomes.

PKM2 deletion accelerated mammary tumor formation in a Brca1-loss-driven model of breast cancer. PKM2 null tumors displayed heterogeneous PKM1 expression, with PKM1 found in nonproliferating tumor cells and no detectable pyruvate kinase expression in proliferating cells. This suggests that PKM2 is not necessary for tumor cell proliferation and implies that the inactive state of PKM2 is associated with the proliferating cell population within tumors, whereas nonproliferating tumor cells require active pyruvate kinase. Consistent with these findings, variable PKM2 expression and heterozygous PKM2 mutations are found in human tumors.

23993097,2013,Cell,A gain-of-function mutation in DHT synthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Growth of prostate cancer cells is dependent upon androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen, is usually synthesized in the prostate from testosterone secreted by the testis. Following chemical or surgical castration, prostate cancers usually shrink owing to testosterone deprivation. However, tumors often recur, forming castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses a gain-of-stability mutation that leads to a gain-of-function in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1), which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in conversion of the adrenal-derived steroid dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT. The mutation (N367T) does not affect catalytic function, but it renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to profound accumulation. Whereas dehydroepiandrosterone conversion to DHT is usually very limited, expression of 367T accelerates this conversion and provides the DHT necessary to activate the AR. We suggest that 3βHSD1 is a valid target for the treatment of CRPC.

Here, we show a role of the breast tumor stroma in selecting cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in bone. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in triple-negative (TN) breast tumors skew heterogeneous cancer cell populations toward a predominance of clones that thrive on the CAF-derived factors CXCL12 and IGF1. Limiting concentrations of these factors select for cancer cells with high Src activity, a known clinical predictor of bone relapse and an enhancer of PI3K-Akt pathway activation by CXCL12 and IGF1. Carcinoma clones selected in this manner are primed for metastasis in the CXCL12-rich microenvironment of the bone marrow. The evidence suggests that stromal signals resembling those of a distant organ select for cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in that organ, thus illuminating the evolution of metastatic traits in a primary tumor and its distant metastases.

23954413,2013,Cell,A mechanical checkpoint controls multicellular growth through YAP/TAZ regulation by actin-processing factors.,"Key cellular decisions, such as proliferation or growth arrest, typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues. Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer. Yet, how these patterns are established is incompletely understood. Here, we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ, known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth. YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses, such as stretching, location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet, or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix. We identify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin, CapZ, and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses, including contact inhibition of proliferation. We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts, setting responsiveness to Hippo, WNT, and GPCR signaling.

Oxidative stress affects mTORC1 via inhibitory and stimulatory inputs. Whereas downregulation of TSC1-TSC2 activates mTORC1 upon oxidative stress, the molecular mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition remains unknown. Here, we identify astrin as an essential negative mTORC1 regulator in the cellular stress response. Upon stress, astrin inhibits mTORC1 association and recruits the mTORC1 component raptor to stress granules (SGs), thereby preventing mTORC1-hyperactivation-induced apoptosis. In turn, balanced mTORC1 activity enables expression of stress factors. By identifying astrin as a direct molecular link between mTORC1, SG assembly, and the stress response, we establish a unifying model of mTORC1 inhibition and activation upon stress. Importantly, we show that in cancer cells, apoptosis suppression during stress depends on astrin. Being frequently upregulated in tumors, astrin is a potential clinically relevant target to sensitize tumors to apoptosis.","Thedieck, Kathrin;Holzwarth, Birgit;Prentzell, Mirja Tamara;Boehlke, Christopher;Kläsener, Kathrin;Ruf, Stefanie;Sonntag, Annika Gwendolin;Maerz, Lars;Grellscheid, Sushma-Nagaraja;Kremmer, Elisabeth;Nitschke, Roland;Kuehn, E Wolfgang;Jonker, Johan W;Groen, Albert K;Reth, Michael;Hall, Michael N;Baumeister, Ralf"

Here, we use Drosophila as a model to explore the effects of diet on tumor progression. Feeding Drosophila a diet high in carbohydrates was previously demonstrated to direct metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. We demonstrate that high dietary sugar also converts Ras/Src-transformed tissue from localized growths to aggressive tumors with emergent metastases. Whereas most tissues displayed insulin resistance, Ras/Src tumors retained insulin pathway sensitivity, increased the ability to import glucose, and resisted apoptosis. High dietary sugar increased canonical Wingless/Wnt pathway activity, which upregulated insulin receptor gene expression to promote insulin sensitivity. The result is a feed-forward circuit that amplified diet-mediated malignant phenotypes within Ras/Src-transformed tumors. By targeting multiple steps in this circuit with rationally applied drug combinations, we demonstrate the potential of combinatorial drug intervention to treat diet-enhanced malignant tumors.

In the present study, we identified a specific Skp2 inhibitor using high-throughput in silico screening of large and diverse chemical libraries. This Skp2 inhibitor selectively suppresses Skp2 E3 ligase activity, but not activity of other SCF complexes. It also phenocopies the effects observed upon genetic Skp2 deficiency, such as suppressing survival and Akt-mediated glycolysis and triggering p53-independent cellular senescence. Strikingly, we discovered a critical function of Skp2 in positively regulating cancer stem cell populations and self-renewal ability through genetic and pharmacological approaches. Notably, Skp2 inhibitor exhibits potent antitumor activities in multiple animal models and cooperates with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce cancer cell survival. Our study thus provides pharmacological evidence that Skp2 is a promising target for restricting cancer stem cell and cancer progression.

KDM4A-amplified tumors have increased copy gains for these same regions. 1q12h copy gain occurs within a single cell cycle, requires S phase, and is not stable but is regenerated each cell division. Sites with increased copy number are rereplicated and have increased KDM4A, MCM, and DNA polymerase occupancy. Suv39h1/KMT1A or HP1γ overexpression suppresses the copy gain, whereas H3K9/K36 methylation interference promotes gain.

Critically, miR-22 promotes aggressive metastatic disease in MMTV-miR-22 TG mice, as well as compound MMTV-neu or -PyVT-miR-22 TG mice. We demonstrate that miR-22 exerts its metastatic potential by silencing antimetastatic miR-200 through direct targeting of the TET (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, thereby inhibiting demethylation of the mir-200 promoter. Finally, we show that miR-22 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and silencing of the TET-miR-200 axis in patients.

Using Ub chains of all eight linkage types, we reveal that most human OTU enzymes are linkage specific, preferring one, two, or a defined subset of linkage types, including unstudied atypical Ub chains. Biochemical analysis and five crystal structures of OTU DUBs with or without Ub substrates reveal four mechanisms of linkage specificity. Additional Ub-binding domains, the ubiquitinated sequence in the substrate, and defined S1' and S2 Ub-binding sites on the OTU domain enable OTU DUBs to distinguish linkage types.

23827675,2013,Cell,Poised chromatin at the ZEB1 promoter enables breast cancer cell plasticity and enhances tumorigenicity.,"The recent discovery that normal and neoplastic epithelial cells re-enter the stem cell state raised the intriguing possibility that the aggressiveness of carcinomas derives not from their existing content of cancer stem cells (CSCs) but from their proclivity to generate new CSCs from non-CSC populations. Here, we demonstrate that non-CSCs of human basal breast cancers are plastic cell populations that readily switch from a non-CSC to CSC state. The observed cell plasticity is dependent on ZEB1, a key regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We find that plastic non-CSCs maintain the ZEB1 promoter in a bivalent chromatin configuration, enabling them to respond readily to microenvironmental signals, such as TGFβ. In response, the ZEB1 promoter converts from a bivalent to active chromatin configuration, ZEB1 transcription increases, and non-CSCs subsequently enter the CSC state. Our findings support a dynamic model in which interconversions between low and high tumorigenic states occur frequently, thereby increasing tumorigenic and malignant potential.

23827674,2013,Cell,Catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse in cancer cell micronuclei.,"During mitotic exit, missegregated chromosomes can recruit their own nuclear envelope (NE) to form micronuclei (MN). MN have reduced functioning compared to primary nuclei in the same cell, although the two compartments appear to be structurally comparable. Here we show that over 60% of MN undergo an irreversible loss of compartmentalization during interphase due to NE collapse. This disruption of the MN, which is induced by defects in nuclear lamina assembly, drastically reduces nuclear functions and can trigger massive DNA damage. MN disruption is associated with chromatin compaction and invasion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules into the chromatin. We identified disrupted MN in both major subtypes of human non-small-cell lung cancer, suggesting that disrupted MN could be a useful objective biomarker for genomic instability in solid tumors.

We were also able to show that FBXW7 mutations specifically affect the ubiquitylation and half-life of c-Myc protein, a key T-ALL oncogene. Using animals carrying c-Myc fusion alleles, we connected Fbxw7 function to c-Myc abundance and correlated c-Myc expression to leukemia-initiating activity.

The Mediator-associated kinase CDK8, but not the paralog CDK19, is required for induction of many HIF1A target genes. HIF1A induces binding of CDK8-Mediator and the super elongation complex (SEC), containing AFF4 and CDK9, to alleviate RNAPII pausing. CDK8 is dispensable for HIF1A chromatin binding and histone acetylation, but it is essential for binding of SEC and RNAPII elongation.

We report that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), which is activated by AMP-kinase (AMPK), confers cell survival under acute nutrient depletion by blocking translation elongation. Tumor cells exploit this pathway to adapt to nutrient deprivation by reactivating the AMPK-eEF2K axis. Adaptation of transformed cells to nutrient withdrawal is severely compromised in cells lacking eEF2K. Moreover, eEF2K knockdown restored sensitivity to acute nutrient deprivation in highly resistant human tumor cell lines. In vivo, overexpression of eEF2K rendered murine tumors remarkably resistant to caloric restriction. Expression of eEF2K strongly correlated with overall survival in human medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. Finally, C. elegans strains deficient in efk-1, the eEF2K ortholog, were severely compromised in their response to nutrient depletion.

23663782,2013,Cell,The mTORC1 pathway stimulates glutamine metabolism and cell proliferation by repressing SIRT4.,"Proliferating mammalian cells use glutamine as a source of nitrogen and as a key anaplerotic source to provide metabolites to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) for biosynthesis. Recently, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation has been correlated with increased nutrient uptake and metabolism, but no molecular connection to glutaminolysis has been reported. Here, we show that mTORC1 promotes glutamine anaplerosis by activating glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This regulation requires transcriptional repression of SIRT4, the mitochondrial-localized sirtuin that inhibits GDH. Mechanistically, mTORC1 represses SIRT4 by promoting the proteasome-mediated destabilization of cAMP-responsive element binding 2 (CREB2). Thus, a relationship between mTORC1, SIRT4, and cancer is suggested by our findings. Indeed, SIRT4 expression is reduced in human cancer, and its overexpression reduces cell proliferation, transformation, and tumor development.

They also co-occupied a small set of exceptionally large super-enhancers associated with genes that feature prominently in MM biology, including the MYC oncogene. Treatment of MM tumor cells with the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 led to preferential loss of BRD4 at super-enhancers and consequent transcription elongation defects that preferentially impacted genes with super-enhancers, including MYC.

In vivo cell lineage tracing with constitutive and lineage-specific fluorescent reporters demonstrated that GSCs generate the majority of vascular pericytes. Selective elimination of GSC-derived pericytes disrupts the neovasculature and potently inhibits tumor growth. Analysis of human GBM specimens showed that most pericytes are derived from neoplastic cells. GSCs are recruited toward endothelial cells via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and are induced to become pericytes predominantly by transforming growth factor β.

Herein, we implicate glutamate-driven NMDAR signaling in a mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis (PNET) and in selected human cancers. NMDAR was upregulated at the periphery of PNET tumors, particularly invasive fronts. Moreover, elevated coexpression of NMDAR and glutamate exporters correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Treatment of a tumor-derived cell line with NMDAR antagonists impaired cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Flow conditions mimicking interstitial fluid pressure induced autologous glutamate secretion, activating NMDAR and its downstream MEK-MAPK and CaMK effectors, thereby promoting invasiveness. Congruently, pharmacological inhibition of NMDAR in mice with PNET reduced tumor growth and invasiveness. Therefore, beyond its traditional role in neurons, NMDAR may be activated in human tumors by fluid flow consequent to higher interstitial pressure, inducing an autocrine glutamate signaling circuit with resultant stimulation of malignancy.","Li, Leanne;Hanahan, Douglas"

To investigate the underlying mechanism, we studied human synovial sarcoma (SS), in which transformation results from the translocation of exactly 78 amino acids of SSX to the SS18 subunit of BAF complexes. We demonstrate that the SS18-SSX fusion protein competes for assembly with wild-type SS18, forming an altered complex lacking the tumor suppressor BAF47 (hSNF5). The altered complex binds the Sox2 locus and reverses polycomb-mediated repression, resulting in Sox2 activation. Sox2 is uniformly expressed in SS tumors and is essential for proliferation. Increasing the concentration of wild-type SS18 leads to reassembly of wild-type complexes retargeted away from the Sox2 locus, polycomb-mediated repression of Sox2, and cessation of proliferation. This mechanism of transformation depends on only two amino acids of SSX, providing a potential foundation for therapeutic intervention.","Kadoch, Cigall;Crabtree, Gerald R"
23540689,2013,Cell,Interplay between the cancer genome and epigenome.,"Cancer arises as a consequence of cumulative disruptions to cellular growth control with Darwinian selection for those heritable changes that provide the greatest clonal advantage. These traits can be acquired and stably maintained by either genetic or epigenetic means. Here, we explore the ways in which alterations in the genome and epigenome influence each other and cooperate to promote oncogenic transformation. Disruption of epigenomic control is pervasive in malignancy and can be classified as an enabling characteristic of cancer cells, akin to genome instability and mutation.","Shen, Hui;Laird, Peter W"

These studies have revealed scores of new cancer genes, including many in processes not previously known to be causal targets in cancer. The genes affect cell signaling, chromatin, and epigenomic regulation; RNA splicing; protein homeostasis; metabolism; and lineage maturation. Still, cancer genomics is in its infancy. Much work remains to complete the mutational catalog in primary tumors and across the natural history of cancer, to connect recurrent genomic alterations to altered pathways and acquired cellular vulnerabilities, and to use this information to guide the development and application of therapies.","Garraway, Levi A;Lander, Eric S"
23498933,2013,Cell,Criteria for inference of chromothripsis in cancer genomes.,"Chromothripsis scars the genome when localized chromosome shattering and repair occurs in a one-off catastrophe. Outcomes of this process are detectable as massive DNA rearrangements affecting one or a few chromosomes. Although recent findings suggest a crucial role of chromothripsis in cancer development, the reproducible inference of this process remains challenging, requiring that cataclysmic one-off rearrangements be distinguished from localized lesions that occur progressively. We describe conceptual criteria for the inference of chromothripsis, based on ruling out the alternative hypothesis that stepwise rearrangements occurred. Robust means of inference may facilitate in-depth studies on the impact of, and the mechanisms underlying, chromothripsis.","Korbel, Jan O;Campbell, Peter J"
23452854,2013,Cell,Targeting placental growth factor/neuropilin 1 pathway inhibits growth and spread of medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor. Although current therapies improve survival, these regimens are highly toxic and are associated with significant morbidity. Here, we report that placental growth factor (PlGF) is expressed in the majority of medulloblastomas, independent of their subtype. Moreover, high expression of PlGF receptor neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) correlates with poor overall survival in patients. We demonstrate that PlGF and Nrp1 are required for the growth and spread of medulloblastoma: PlGF/Nrp1 blockade results in direct antitumor effects in vivo, resulting in medulloblastoma regression, decreased metastasis, and increased mouse survival. We reveal that PlGF is produced in the cerebellar stroma via tumor-derived Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and show that PlGF acts through Nrp1-and not vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-to promote tumor cell survival. This critical tumor-stroma interaction-mediated by Shh, PlGF, and Nrp1 across medulloblastoma subtypes-supports the development of therapies targeting PlGF/Nrp1 pathway.","Snuderl, Matija;Batista, Ana;Kirkpatrick, Nathaniel D;Ruiz de Almodovar, Carmen;Riedemann, Lars;Walsh, Elisa C;Anolik, Rachel;Huang, Yuhui;Martin, John D;Kamoun, Walid;Knevels, Ellen;Schmidt, Thomas;Farrar, Christian T;Vakoc, Benjamin J;Mohan, Nishant;Chung, Euiheon;Roberge, Sylvie;Peterson, Teresa;Bais, Carlos;Zhelyazkova, Boryana H;Yip, Stephen;Hasselblatt, Martin;Rossig, Claudia;Niemeyer, Elisabeth;Ferrara, Napoleone;Klagsbrun, Michael;Duda, Dan G;Fukumura, Dai;Xu, Lei;Carmeliet, Peter;Jain, Rakesh K"
23434321,2013,Cell,CXCR4/CXCL12 mediate autocrine cell- cycle progression in NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue sarcomas that arise in connective tissue surrounding peripheral nerves. They occur sporadically in a subset of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). MPNSTs are highly aggressive, therapeutically resistant, and typically fatal. Using comparative transcriptome analysis, we identified CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor, as highly expressed in mouse models of NF1-deficient MPNSTs, but not in nontransformed precursor cells. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, promote MPNST growth by stimulating cyclin D1 expression and cell-cycle progression through PI3-kinase (PI3K) and β-catenin signaling. Suppression of CXCR4 activity either by shRNA or pharmacological inhibition decreases MPNST cell growth in culture and inhibits tumorigenesis in allografts and in spontaneous genetic mouse models of MPNST. We further demonstrate conservation of these activated molecular pathways in human MPNSTs. Our findings indicate a role for CXCR4 in NF1-associated MPNST development and identify a therapeutic target.","Mo, Wei;Chen, Jian;Patel, Amish;Zhang, Liang;Chau, Vincent;Li, Yanjiao;Cho, Woosung;Lim, Kyun;Xu, Jing;Lazar, Alexander J;Creighton, Chad J;Bolshakov, Svetlana;McKay, Renée M;Lev, Dina;Le, Lu Q;Parada, Luis F"
23415222,2013,Cell,Evolution and impact of subclonal mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Clonal evolution is a key feature of cancer progression and relapse. We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.","Landau, Dan A;Carter, Scott L;Stojanov, Petar;McKenna, Aaron;Stevenson, Kristen;Lawrence, Michael S;Sougnez, Carrie;Stewart, Chip;Sivachenko, Andrey;Wang, Lili;Wan, Youzhong;Zhang, Wandi;Shukla, Sachet A;Vartanov, Alexander;Fernandes, Stacey M;Saksena, Gordon;Cibulskis, Kristian;Tesar, Bethany;Gabriel, Stacey;Hacohen, Nir;Meyerson, Matthew;Lander, Eric S;Neuberg, Donna;Brown, Jennifer R;Getz, Gad;Wu, Catherine J"

Of the factors we measured, cis-acting eQTLs accounted for 1.2% of the total variation of tumor gene expression, while somatic copy-number alteration and CpG methylation accounted for 7.3% and 3.3%, respectively. eQTL analyses of 15 previously reported breast cancer risk loci resulted in the discovery of three variants that are significantly associated with transcript levels (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1). Our trans-based analysis identified an additional three risk loci to act through ESR1, MYC, and KLF4. These findings provide a more comprehensive picture of gene expression determinants in breast cancer as well as insights into the underlying biology of breast cancer risk loci.","Li, Qiyuan;Seo, Ji-Heui;Stranger, Barbara;McKenna, Aaron;Pe'er, Itsik;Laframboise, Thomas;Brown, Myles;Tyekucheva, Svitlana;Freedman, Matthew L"

We show that PKCζ deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine through the serine biosynthetic pathway in the absence of glucose. PKCζ represses the expression of two key enzymes of the pathway, PHGDH and PSAT1, and phosphorylates PHGDH at key residues to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the loss of PKCζ in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis and increased levels of these two metabolic enzymes, whereas patients with low levels of PKCζ have a poor prognosis. Furthermore, PKCζ and caspase-3 activities are correlated with PHGDH levels in human intestinal tumors. Taken together, this demonstrates that PKCζ is a critical metabolic tumor suppressor in mouse and human cancer.","Ma, Li;Tao, Yongzhen;Duran, Angeles;Llado, Victoria;Galvez, Anita;Barger, Jennifer F;Castilla, Elias A;Chen, Jing;Yajima, Tomoko;Porollo, Aleksey;Medvedovic, Mario;Brill, Laurence M;Plas, David R;Riedl, Stefan J;Leitges, Michael;Diaz-Meco, Maria T;Richardson, Adam D;Moscat, Jorge"

23332765,2013,Cell,Monitoring tumorigenesis and senescence in vivo with a p16(INK4a)-luciferase model.,"Monitoring cancer and aging in vivo remains experimentally challenging. Here, we describe a luciferase knockin mouse (p16(LUC)), which faithfully reports expression of p16(INK4a), a tumor suppressor and aging biomarker. Lifelong assessment of luminescence in p16(+/LUC) mice revealed an exponential increase with aging, which was highly variable in a cohort of contemporaneously housed, syngeneic mice. Expression of p16(INK4a) with aging did not predict cancer development, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells is not a principal determinant of cancer-related death. In 14 of 14 tested tumor models, expression of p16(LUC) was focally activated by early neoplastic events, enabling visualization of tumors with sensitivity exceeding other imaging modalities. Activation of p16(INK4a) was noted in the emerging neoplasm and surrounding stromal cells. This work suggests that p16(INK4a) activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers, making the p16(LUC) allele a sensitive, unbiased reporter of neoplastic transformation.","Burd, Christin E;Sorrentino, Jessica A;Clark, Kelly S;Darr, David B;Krishnamurthy, Janakiraman;Deal, Allison M;Bardeesy, Nabeel;Castrillon, Diego H;Beach, David H;Sharpless, Norman E"

NF-κB represents a key transcription factor within the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. However, NF-κB's function in tumor-initiating cells has not been examined yet. Using a genetic model of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-restricted constitutive Wnt-activation, which comprises the most common event in the initiation of colon cancer, we demonstrate that NF-κB modulates Wnt signaling and show that IEC-specific ablation of RelA/p65 retards crypt stem cell expansion. In contrast, elevated NF-κB signaling enhances Wnt activation and induces dedifferentiation of nonstem cells that acquire tumor-initiating capacity. Thus, our data support the concept of bidirectional conversion and highlight the importance of inflammatory signaling for dedifferentiation and generation of tumor-initiating cells in vivo.","Schwitalla, Sarah;Fingerle, Alexander A;Cammareri, Patrizia;Nebelsiek, Tim;Göktuna, Serkan I;Ziegler, Paul K;Canli, Ozge;Heijmans, Jarom;Huels, David J;Moreaux, Guenievre;Rupec, Rudolf A;Gerhard, Markus;Schmid, Roland;Barker, Nick;Clevers, Hans;Lang, Roland;Neumann, Jens;Kirchner, Thomas;Taketo, Makoto M;van den Brink, Gijs R;Sansom, Owen J;Arkan, Melek C;Greten, Florian R"

Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by many cell types and enable a potent mode of intercellular communication. Here, we report that fibroblast-secreted exosomes promote breast cancer cell (BCC) protrusive activity and motility via Wnt-planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. We show that exosome-stimulated BCC protrusions display mutually exclusive localization of the core PCP complexes, Fzd-Dvl and Vangl-Pk. In orthotopic mouse models of breast cancer, coinjection of BCCs with fibroblasts dramatically enhances metastasis that is dependent on PCP signaling in BCCs and the exosome component, Cd81 in fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that trafficking in BCCs promotes tethering of autocrine Wnt11 to fibroblast-derived exosomes. This work reveals an intercellular communication pathway whereby fibroblast exosomes mobilize autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling to drive BCC invasive behavior.","Luga, Valbona;Zhang, Liang;Viloria-Petit, Alicia M;Ogunjimi, Abiodun A;Inanlou, Mohammad R;Chiu, Elaine;Buchanan, Marguerite;Hosein, Abdel Nasser;Basik, Mark;Wrana, Jeffrey L"

Inhibiting Ligase IV could result in amassing of DSBs, thereby serving as a strategy toward treatment of cancer. Here, we identify a molecule, SCR7 that inhibits joining of DSBs in cell-free repair system. SCR7 blocks Ligase IV-mediated joining by interfering with its DNA binding but not that of T4 DNA Ligase or Ligase I. SCR7 inhibits NHEJ in a Ligase IV-dependent manner within cells, and activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. More importantly, SCR7 impedes tumor progression in mouse models and when coadministered with DSB-inducing therapeutic modalities enhances their sensitivity significantly.

To decipher the role of β-catenin in transformation, we classified β-catenin activity in 85 cancer cell lines in which we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens and found that β-catenin active cancers are dependent on a signaling pathway involving the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Specifically, we found that YAP1 and the transcription factor TBX5 form a complex with β-catenin. Phosphorylation of YAP1 by the tyrosine kinase YES1 leads to localization of this complex to the promoters of antiapoptotic genes, including BCL2L1 and BIRC5. A small-molecule inhibitor of YES1 impeded the proliferation of β-catenin-dependent cancers in both cell lines and animal models.

Despite being known for decades (Warburg effect), the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored. Here, we identify SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor that regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Importantly, loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes, whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth, suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer. By using a conditional SIRT6 allele, we show that SIRT6 deletion in vivo increases the number, size, and aggressiveness of tumors. SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolism by corepressing MYC transcriptional activity. Lastly, Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers, and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates, highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancer metabolism.

23178117,2012,Cell,MED12 controls the response to multiple cancer drugs through regulation of TGF-β receptor signaling.,"Inhibitors of the ALK and EGF receptor tyrosine kinases provoke dramatic but short-lived responses in lung cancers harboring EML4-ALK translocations or activating mutations of EGFR, respectively. We used a large-scale RNAi screen to identify MED12, a component of the transcriptional MEDIATOR complex that is mutated in cancers, as a determinant of response to ALK and EGFR inhibitors. MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF-βR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-βR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-β signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. MED12 loss induces an EMT-like phenotype, which is associated with chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer patients and to gefitinib in lung cancer. Inhibition of TGF-βR signaling restores drug responsiveness in MED12(KD) cells, suggesting a strategy to treat drug-resistant tumors that have lost MED12.","Huang, Sidong;Hölzel, Michael;Knijnenburg, Theo;Schlicker, Andreas;Roepman, Paul;McDermott, Ultan;Garnett, Mathew;Grernrum, Wipawadee;Sun, Chong;Prahallad, Anirudh;Groenendijk, Floris H;Mittempergher, Lorenza;Nijkamp, Wouter;Neefjes, Jacques;Salazar, Ramon;Ten Dijke, Peter;Uramoto, Hidetaka;Tanaka, Fumihiro;Beijersbergen, Roderick L;Wessels, Lodewyk F A;Bernards, René"
23142051,2012,Cell,Convergent multi-miRNA targeting of ApoE drives LRP1/LRP8-dependent melanoma metastasis and angiogenesis.,"Through in vivo selection of human cancer cell populations, we uncover a convergent and cooperative miRNA network that drives melanoma metastasis. We identify miR-1908, miR-199a-5p, and miR-199a-3p as endogenous promoters of metastatic invasion, angiogenesis, and colonization in melanoma. These miRNAs convergently target apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the heat shock factor DNAJA4. Cancer-secreted ApoE suppresses invasion and metastatic endothelial recruitment (MER) by engaging melanoma cell LRP1 and endothelial cell LRP8 receptors, respectively, while DNAJA4 promotes ApoE expression. Expression levels of these miRNAs and ApoE correlate with human metastatic progression outcomes. Treatment of cells with locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting these miRNAs inhibits metastasis to multiple organs, and therapeutic delivery of these LNAs strongly suppresses melanoma metastasis. We thus identify miRNAs with dual cell-intrinsic/cell-extrinsic roles in cancer, reveal convergent cooperativity in a metastatic miRNA network, identify ApoE as an anti-angiogenic and metastasis-suppressive factor, and uncover multiple prognostic miRNAs with synergistic combinatorial therapeutic potential in melanoma.","Pencheva, Nora;Tran, Hien;Buss, Colin;Huh, Doowon;Drobnjak, Marija;Busam, Klaus;Tavazoie, Sohail F"

Rather than taking a genetic approach favored by many, we took a functional approach to ask how differential mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis (""priming"") might explain individual variation in clinical behavior. We found that mitochondrial priming measured by BH3 profiling was a determinant of initial response to induction chemotherapy, relapse after remission, and requirement for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Differential priming between malignant myeloblasts and normal hematopoietic stem cells supports a mitochondrial basis to the therapeutic index for chemotherapy. BH3 profiling identified BCL-2 inhibition as a targeted strategy likely to have a useful therapeutic index. BH3 profiling refines predictive information provided by conventional biomarkers currently in use and thus may itself have utility as a clinical predictive biomarker.

The effect of high levels of c-Myc on global gene regulation is poorly understood but is widely thought to involve newly activated or repressed ""Myc target genes."" We report here that in tumor cells expressing high levels of c-Myc the transcription factor accumulates in the promoter regions of active genes and causes transcriptional amplification, producing increased levels of transcripts within the cell's gene expression program. Thus, rather than binding and regulating a new set of genes, c-Myc amplifies the output of the existing gene expression program. These results provide an explanation for the diverse effects of oncogenic c-Myc on gene expression in different tumor cells and suggest that transcriptional amplification reduces rate-limiting constraints for tumor cell growth and proliferation.","Lin, Charles Y;Lovén, Jakob;Rahl, Peter B;Paranal, Ronald M;Burge, Christopher B;Bradner, James E;Lee, Tong Ihn;Young, Richard A"

Here, we report that ""loss of 5-hmC"" is an epigenetic hallmark of melanoma, with diagnostic and prognostic implications. Genome-wide mapping of 5-hmC reveals loss of the 5-hmC landscape in the melanoma epigenome. We show that downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and TET family enzymes is likely one of the mechanisms underlying 5-hmC loss in melanoma. Rebuilding the 5-hmC landscape in melanoma cells by reintroducing active TET2 or IDH2 suppresses melanoma growth and increases tumor-free survival in animal models. Thus, our study reveals a critical function of 5-hmC in melanoma development and directly links the IDH and TET activity-dependent epigenetic pathway to 5-hmC-mediated suppression of melanoma progression, suggesting a new strategy for epigenetic cancer therapy.","Lian, Christine Guo;Xu, Yufei;Ceol, Craig;Wu, Feizhen;Larson, Allison;Dresser, Karen;Xu, Wenqi;Tan, Li;Hu, Yeguang;Zhan, Qian;Lee, Chung-Wei;Hu, Di;Lian, Bill Q;Kleffel, Sonja;Yang, Yijun;Neiswender, James;Khorasani, Abraham J;Fang, Rui;Lezcano, Cecilia;Duncan, Lyn M;Scolyer, Richard A;Thompson, John F;Kakavand, Hojabr;Houvras, Yariv;Zon, Leonard I;Mihm, Martin C;Kaiser, Ursula B;Schatton, Tobias;Woda, Bruce A;Murphy, George F;Shi, Yujiang G"

One CYCLOPS gene, PSMC2, encodes an essential member of the 19S proteasome. Normal cells express excess PSMC2, which resides in a complex with PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5 and acts as a reservoir protecting cells from PSMC2 suppression.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities.","Wang, Yuan;Kim, Edward;Wang, Xiaojing;Novitch, Bennett G;Yoshikawa, Kazuaki;Chang, Long-Sheng;Zhu, Yuan"
22901808,2012,Cell,The BMP inhibitor Coco reactivates breast cancer cells at lung metastatic sites.,"The mechanistic underpinnings of metastatic dormancy and reactivation are poorly understood. A gain-of-function cDNA screen reveals that Coco, a secreted antagonist of TGF-β ligands, induces dormant breast cancer cells to undergo reactivation in the lung. Mechanistic studies indicate that Coco exerts this effect by blocking lung-derived BMP ligands. Whereas Coco enhances the manifestation of traits associated with cancer stem cells, BMP signaling suppresses it. Coco induces a discrete gene expression signature, which is strongly associated with metastatic relapse to the lung, but not to the bone or brain in patients. Experiments in mouse models suggest that these latter organs contain niches devoid of bioactive BMP. These findings reveal that metastasis-initiating cells need to overcome organ-specific antimetastatic signals in order to undergo reactivation.","Gao, Hua;Chakraborty, Goutam;Lee-Lim, Ai Ping;Mo, Qianxing;Decker, Markus;Vonica, Alin;Shen, Ronglai;Brogi, Edi;Brivanlou, Ali H;Giancotti, Filippo G"
22901803,2012,Cell,PKM2 phosphorylates histone H3 and promotes gene transcription and tumorigenesis.,"Tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is essential for the Warburg effect. In addition to its well-established role in aerobic glycolysis, PKM2 directly regulates gene transcription. However, the mechanism underlying this nonmetabolic function of PKM2 remains elusive. We show here that PKM2 directly binds to histone H3 and phosphorylates histone H3 at T11 upon EGF receptor activation. This phosphorylation is required for the dissociation of HDAC3 from the CCND1 and MYC promoter regions and subsequent acetylation of histone H3 at K9. PKM2-dependent histone H3 modifications are instrumental in EGF-induced expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, tumor cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and brain tumorigenesis. In addition, levels of histone H3 T11 phosphorylation correlate with nuclear PKM2 expression levels, glioma malignancy grades, and prognosis. These findings highlight the role of PKM2 as a protein kinase in its nonmetabolic functions of histone modification, which is essential for its epigenetic regulation of gene expression and tumorigenesis.","Yang, Weiwei;Xia, Yan;Hawke, David;Li, Xinjian;Liang, Ji;Xing, Dongming;Aldape, Kenneth;Hunter, Tony;Alfred Yung, W K;Lu, Zhimin"
22863010,2012,Cell,Identification of regulators of polyploidization presents therapeutic targets for treatment of AMKL.,"The mechanism by which cells decide to skip mitosis to become polyploid is largely undefined. Here we used a high-content image-based screen to identify small-molecule probes that induce polyploidization of megakaryocytic leukemia cells and serve as perturbagens to help understand this process. Our study implicates five networks of kinases that regulate the switch to polyploidy. Moreover, we find that dimethylfasudil (diMF, H-1152P) selectively increased polyploidization, mature cell-surface marker expression, and apoptosis of malignant megakaryocytes. An integrated target identification approach employing proteomic and shRNA screening revealed that a major target of diMF is Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We further find that MLN8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo. Our findings provide a rationale to support clinical trials of MLN8237 and other inducers of polyploidization and differentiation in AMKL.","Wen, Qiang;Goldenson, Benjamin;Silver, Serena J;Schenone, Monica;Dancik, Vlado;Huang, Zan;Wang, Ling-Zhi;Lewis, Timothy A;An, W Frank;Li, Xiaoyu;Bray, Mark-Anthony;Thiollier, Clarisse;Diebold, Lauren;Gilles, Laure;Vokes, Martha S;Moore, Christopher B;Bliss-Moreau, Meghan;Verplank, Lynn;Tolliday, Nicola J;Mishra, Rama;Vemula, Sasidhar;Shi, Jianjian;Wei, Lei;Kapur, Reuben;Lopez, Cécile K;Gerby, Bastien;Ballerini, Paola;Pflumio, Francoise;Gilliland, D Gary;Goldberg, Liat;Birger, Yehudit;Izraeli, Shai;Gamis, Alan S;Smith, Franklin O;Woods, William G;Taub, Jeffrey;Scherer, Christina A;Bradner, James E;Goh, Boon-Cher;Mercher, Thomas;Carpenter, Anne E;Gould, Robert J;Clemons, Paul A;Carr, Steven A;Root, David E;Schreiber, Stuart L;Stern, Andrew M;Crispino, John D"
22863009,2012,Cell,Tristetraprolin impairs myc-induced lymphoma and abolishes the malignant state.,"Myc oncoproteins directly regulate transcription by binding to target genes, yet this only explains a fraction of the genes affected by Myc. mRNA turnover is controlled via AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that recognize AU-rich elements (AREs) found within many transcripts. Analyses of precancerous and malignant Myc-expressing B cells revealed that Myc regulates hundreds of ARE-containing (ARED) genes and select AUBPs. Notably, Myc directly suppresses transcription of Tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), an mRNA-destabilizing AUBP, and this circuit is also operational during B lymphopoiesis and IL7 signaling. Importantly, TTP suppression is a hallmark of cancers with MYC involvement, and restoring TTP impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and abolishes maintenance of the malignant state. Further, there is a selection for TTP loss in malignancy; thus, TTP functions as a tumor suppressor. Finally, Myc/TTP-directed control of select cancer-associated ARED genes is disabled during lymphomagenesis. Thus, Myc targets AUBPs to regulate ARED genes that control tumorigenesis.","Rounbehler, Robert J;Fallahi, Mohammad;Yang, Chunying;Steeves, Meredith A;Li, Weimin;Doherty, Joanne R;Schaub, Franz X;Sanduja, Sandhya;Dixon, Dan A;Blackshear, Perry J;Cleveland, John L"
22863008,2012,Cell,HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to support highly malignant human cancers.,"Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), master regulator of the heat-shock response, facilitates malignant transformation, cancer cell survival, and proliferation in model systems. The common assumption is that these effects are mediated through regulation of heat-shock protein (HSP) expression. However, the transcriptional network that HSF1 coordinates directly in malignancy and its relationship to the heat-shock response have never been defined. By comparing cells with high and low malignant potential alongside their nontransformed counterparts, we identify an HSF1-regulated transcriptional program specific to highly malignant cells and distinct from heat shock. Cancer-specific genes in this program support oncogenic processes: cell-cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation. HSP genes are integral to this program, however, many are uniquely regulated in malignancy. This HSF1 cancer program is active in breast, colon and lung tumors isolated directly from human patients and is strongly associated with metastasis and death. Thus, HSF1 rewires the transcriptome in tumorigenesis, with prognostic and therapeutic implications.","Mendillo, Marc L;Santagata, Sandro;Koeva, Martina;Bell, George W;Hu, Rong;Tamimi, Rulla M;Fraenkel, Ernest;Ince, Tan A;Whitesell, Luke;Lindquist, Susan"
22817890,2012,Cell,The origin and evolution of mutations in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Most mutations in cancer genomes are thought to be acquired after the initiating event, which may cause genomic instability and drive clonal evolution. However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is ""captured"" as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.","Welch, John S;Ley, Timothy J;Link, Daniel C;Miller, Christopher A;Larson, David E;Koboldt, Daniel C;Wartman, Lukas D;Lamprecht, Tamara L;Liu, Fulu;Xia, Jun;Kandoth, Cyriac;Fulton, Robert S;McLellan, Michael D;Dooling, David J;Wallis, John W;Chen, Ken;Harris, Christopher C;Schmidt, Heather K;Kalicki-Veizer, Joelle M;Lu, Charles;Zhang, Qunyuan;Lin, Ling;O'Laughlin, Michelle D;McMichael, Joshua F;Delehaunty, Kim D;Fulton, Lucinda A;Magrini, Vincent J;McGrath, Sean D;Demeter, Ryan T;Vickery, Tammi L;Hundal, Jasreet;Cook, Lisa L;Swift, Gary W;Reed, Jerry P;Alldredge, Patricia A;Wylie, Todd N;Walker, Jason R;Watson, Mark A;Heath, Sharon E;Shannon, William D;Varghese, Nobish;Nagarajan, Rakesh;Payton, Jacqueline E;Baty, Jack D;Kulkarni, Shashikant;Klco, Jeffery M;Tomasson, Michael H;Westervelt, Peter;Walter, Matthew J;Graubert, Timothy A;DiPersio, John F;Ding, Li;Mardis, Elaine R;Wilson, Richard K"
22817889,2012,Cell,A landscape of driver mutations in melanoma.,"Despite recent insights into melanoma genetics, systematic surveys for driver mutations are challenged by an abundance of passenger mutations caused by carcinogenic UV light exposure. We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy.

Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, cytoplasmic Skp2 correlates with more aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancers. Here, we report that Skp2 is acetylated by p300 at K68 and K71, which is a process that can be antagonized by the SIRT3 deacetylase. Inactivation of SIRT3 leads to elevated Skp2 acetylation, which leads to increased Skp2 stability through impairment of the Cdh1-mediated proteolysis pathway. As a result, Skp2 oncogenic function is increased, whereby cells expressing an acetylation-mimetic mutant display enhanced cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, acetylation of Skp2 in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) promotes its cytoplasmic retention, and cytoplasmic Skp2 enhances cellular migration through ubiquitination and destruction of E-cadherin. Thus, our study identifies an acetylation-dependent regulatory mechanism governing Skp2 oncogenic function and provides insight into how cytoplasmic Skp2 controls cellular migration.","Inuzuka, Hiroyuki;Gao, Daming;Finley, Lydia W S;Yang, Wen;Wan, Lixin;Fukushima, Hidefumi;Chin, Y Rebecca;Zhai, Bo;Shaik, Shavali;Lau, Alan W;Wang, Zhiwei;Gygi, Steven P;Nakayama, Keiko;Teruya-Feldstein, Julie;Toker, Alex;Haigis, Marcia C;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo;Wei, Wenyi"
22770218,2012,Cell,A CXCL1 paracrine network links cancer chemoresistance and metastasis.,"Metastasis and chemoresistance in cancer are linked phenomena, but the molecular basis for this link is unknown. We uncovered a network of paracrine signals between carcinoma, myeloid, and endothelial cells that drives both processes in breast cancer. Cancer cells that overexpress CXCL1 and 2 by transcriptional hyperactivation or 4q21 amplification are primed for survival in metastatic sites. CXCL1/2 attract CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cells into the tumor, which produce chemokines including S100A8/9 that enhance cancer cell survival. Although chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells, these treatments trigger a parallel stromal reaction leading to TNF-α production by endothelial and other stromal cells. TNF-α via NF-kB heightens the CXCL1/2 expression in cancer cells, thus amplifying the CXCL1/2-S100A8/9 loop and causing chemoresistance. CXCR2 blockers break this cycle, augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy against breast tumors and particularly against metastasis. This network of endothelial-carcinoma-myeloid signaling interactions provides a mechanism linking chemoresistance and metastasis, with opportunities for intervention.","Acharyya, Swarnali;Oskarsson, Thordur;Vanharanta, Sakari;Malladi, Srinivas;Kim, Juliet;Morris, Patrick G;Manova-Todorova, Katia;Leversha, Margaret;Hogg, Nancy;Seshan, Venkatraman E;Norton, Larry;Brogi, Edi;Massagué, Joan"

Mice carrying a mesenchymal-specific deletion of CSL/RBP-Jκ, a key Notch effector, exhibit spontaneous multifocal keratinocyte tumors that develop after dermal atrophy and inflammation. CSL-deficient dermal fibroblasts promote increased tumor cell proliferation through upregulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression and consequently higher levels of diffusible growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix-remodeling enzymes. In human skin samples, stromal fields adjacent to multifocal premalignant actinic keratosis lesions exhibit decreased Notch/CSL signaling and associated molecular changes. Importantly, these changes in gene expression are also induced by UVA, a known environmental cause of cutaneous field cancerization and skin cancer.","Hu, Bing;Castillo, Einar;Harewood, Louise;Ostano, Paola;Reymond, Alexandre;Dummer, Reinhard;Raffoul, Wassim;Hoetzenecker, Wolfram;Hofbauer, Günther F L;Dotto, G Paolo"

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.","Nik-Zainal, Serena;Van Loo, Peter;Wedge, David C;Alexandrov, Ludmil B;Greenman, Christopher D;Lau, King Wai;Raine, Keiran;Jones, David;Marshall, John;Ramakrishna, Manasa;Shlien, Adam;Cooke, Susanna L;Hinton, Jonathan;Menzies, Andrew;Stebbings, Lucy A;Leroy, Catherine;Jia, Mingming;Rance, Richard;Mudie, Laura J;Gamble, Stephen J;Stephens, Philip J;McLaren, Stuart;Tarpey, Patrick S;Papaemmanuil, Elli;Davies, Helen R;Varela, Ignacio;McBride, David J;Bignell, Graham R;Leung, Kenric;Butler, Adam P;Teague, Jon W;Martin, Sancha;Jönsson, Goran;Mariani, Odette;Boyault, Sandrine;Miron, Penelope;Fatima, Aquila;Langerød, Anita;Aparicio, Samuel A J R;Tutt, Andrew;Sieuwerts, Anieta M;Borg, Åke;Thomas, Gilles;Salomon, Anne Vincent;Richardson, Andrea L;Børresen-Dale, Anne-Lise;Futreal, P Andrew;Stratton, Michael R;Campbell, Peter J"
22579287,2012,Cell,Oncogenic mutations counteract intrinsic disorder in the EGFR kinase and promote receptor dimerization.,"The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization.

Here, an inducible Kras(G12D)-driven PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on Kras(G12D) expression. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses indicate that Kras(G12D) serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates into the hexosamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP). These studies also reveal that oncogenic Kras promotes ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models, we demonstrate that Kras(G12D) drives glycolysis intermediates into the nonoxidative PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADP/NADPH-mediated redox control.

Here we show that RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells depend on the transcription factor GATA2. Loss of GATA2 reduced the viability of NSCLC cells with RAS-pathway mutations, whereas wild-type cells were unaffected. Integrated gene expression and genome occupancy analyses revealed GATA2 regulation of the proteasome, and IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. These pathways were functionally significant, as reactivation rescued viability after GATA2 depletion. In a Kras-driven NSCLC mouse model, Gata2 loss dramatically reduced tumor development. Furthermore, Gata2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression. Although GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused marked tumor clearance.

Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, and prevention of proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 inhibition, but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression where single agents were ineffective.

22464321,2012,Cell,MYC on the path to cancer.,"The MYC oncogene contributes to the genesis of many human cancers. Recent insights into its expression and function have led to therapeutic opportunities. MYC's activation by bromodomain proteins could be inhibited by drug-like molecules, resulting in tumor inhibition in vivo. Tumor growth can also be curbed by pharmacologically uncoupling bioenergetic pathways involving glucose or glutamine metabolism from Myc-induced cellular biomass accumulation. Other approaches to halt Myc on the path to cancer involve targeting Myc-Max dimerization or Myc-induced microRNA expression. Here the richness of our understanding of MYC is reviewed, highlighting new biological insights and opportunities for cancer therapies.","Dang, Chi V"
22424221,2012,Cell,Converting cancer therapies into cures: lessons from infectious diseases.,"During the past decade, cancer drug development has shifted from a focus on cytotoxic chemotherapies to drugs that target specific molecular alterations in tumors. Although these drugs dramatically shrink tumors, the responses are temporary. Research is now focused on overcoming drug resistance, a frequent cause of treatment failure. Here we reflect on analogous challenges faced by researchers in infectious diseases. We compare and contrast the resistance mechanisms arising in cancer and infectious diseases and discuss how approaches for overcoming viral and bacterial infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis, are instructive for developing a more rational approach for cancer therapy. In particular, maximizing the effect of the initial treatment response, which often requires synergistic combination therapy, is foremost among these approaches. A remaining challenge in both fields is identifying drugs that eliminate drug-tolerant ""persister"" cells (infectious disease) or tumor-initiating/stem cells (cancer) to prevent late relapse and shorten treatment duration.","Glickman, Michael S;Sawyers, Charles L"

22385965,2012,Cell,Slug and Sox9 cooperatively determine the mammary stem cell state.,"Regulatory networks orchestrated by key transcription factors (TFs) have been proposed to play a central role in the determination of stem cell states. However, the master transcriptional regulators of adult stem cells are poorly understood. We have identified two TFs, Slug and Sox9, that act cooperatively to determine the mammary stem cell (MaSC) state. Inhibition of either Slug or Sox9 blocks MaSC activity in primary mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, transient coexpression of exogenous Slug and Sox9 suffices to convert differentiated luminal cells into MaSCs with long-term mammary gland-reconstituting ability. Slug and Sox9 induce MaSCs by activating distinct autoregulatory gene expression programs. We also show that coexpression of Slug and Sox9 promotes the tumorigenic and metastasis-seeding abilities of human breast cancer cells and is associated with poor patient survival, providing direct evidence that human breast cancer stem cells are controlled by key regulators similar to those operating in normal murine MaSCs.","Guo, Wenjun;Keckesova, Zuzana;Donaher, Joana Liu;Shibue, Tsukasa;Tischler, Verena;Reinhardt, Ferenc;Itzkovitz, Shalev;Noske, Aurelia;Zürrer-Härdi, Ursina;Bell, George;Tam, Wai Leong;Mani, Sendurai A;van Oudenaarden, Alexander;Weinberg, Robert A"

To better understand the intratumoral genetics underlying mutations of ccRCC, we carried out single-cell exome sequencing on a ccRCC tumor and its adjacent kidney tissue. Our data indicate that this tumor was unlikely to have resulted from mutations in VHL and PBRM1. Quantitative population genetic analysis indicates that the tumor did not contain any significant clonal subpopulations and also showed that mutations that had different allele frequencies within the population also had different mutation spectrums. Analyses of these data allowed us to delineate a detailed intratumoral genetic landscape at a single-cell level. Our pilot study demonstrates that ccRCC may be more genetically complex than previously thought and provides information that can lead to new ways to investigate individual tumors, with the aim of developing more effective cellular targeted therapies.","Xu, Xun;Hou, Yong;Yin, Xuyang;Bao, Li;Tang, Aifa;Song, Luting;Li, Fuqiang;Tsang, Shirley;Wu, Kui;Wu, Hanjie;He, Weiming;Zeng, Liang;Xing, Manjie;Wu, Renhua;Jiang, Hui;Liu, Xiao;Cao, Dandan;Guo, Guangwu;Hu, Xueda;Gui, Yaoting;Li, Zesong;Xie, Wenyue;Sun, Xiaojuan;Shi, Min;Cai, Zhiming;Wang, Bin;Zhong, Meiming;Li, Jingxiang;Lu, Zuhong;Gu, Ning;Zhang, Xiuqing;Goodman, Laurie;Bolund, Lars;Wang, Jian;Yang, Huanming;Kristiansen, Karsten;Dean, Michael;Li, Yingrui;Wang, Jun"
22341456,2012,Cell,Spatial organization of the mouse genome and its role in recurrent chromosomal translocations.,"The extent to which the three-dimensional organization of the genome contributes to chromosomal translocations is an important question in cancer genomics. We generated a high-resolution Hi-C spatial organization map of the G1-arrested mouse pro-B cell genome and used high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing to map translocations from target DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within it. RAG endonuclease-cleaved antigen-receptor loci are dominant translocation partners for target DSBs regardless of genomic position, reflecting high-frequency DSBs at these loci and their colocalization in a fraction of cells. To directly assess spatial proximity contributions, we normalized genomic DSBs via ionizing radiation. Under these conditions, translocations were highly enriched in cis along single chromosomes containing target DSBs and within other chromosomes and subchromosomal domains in a manner directly related to pre-existing spatial proximity. By combining two high-throughput genomic methods in a genetically tractable system, we provide a new lens for viewing cancer genomes.","Zhang, Yu;McCord, Rachel Patton;Ho, Yu-Jui;Lajoie, Bryan R;Hildebrand, Dominic G;Simon, Aline C;Becker, Michael S;Alt, Frederick W;Dekker, Job"
22341455,2012,Cell,Telomerase reactivation following telomere dysfunction yields murine prostate tumors with bone metastases.,"To determine the role of telomere dysfunction and telomerase reactivation in generating pro-oncogenic genomic events and in carcinoma progression, an inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTert) allele was crossed onto a prostate cancer-prone mouse model null for Pten and p53 tumor suppressors. Constitutive telomerase deficiency and associated telomere dysfunction constrained cancer progression. In contrast, telomerase reactivation in the setting of telomere dysfunction alleviated intratumoral DNA-damage signaling and generated aggressive cancers with rearranged genomes and new tumor biological properties (bone metastases). Comparative oncogenomic analysis revealed numerous recurrent amplifications and deletions of relevance to human prostate cancer. Murine tumors show enrichment of the TGF-β/SMAD4 network, and genetic validation studies confirmed the cooperative roles of Pten, p53, and Smad4 deficiencies in prostate cancer progression, including skeletal metastases. Thus, telomerase reactivation in tumor cells experiencing telomere dysfunction enables full malignant progression and provides a mechanism for acquisition of cancer-relevant genomic events endowing new tumor biological capabilities.","Ding, Zhihu;Wu, Chang-Jiun;Jaskelioff, Mariela;Ivanova, Elena;Kost-Alimova, Maria;Protopopov, Alexei;Chu, Gerald C;Wang, Guocan;Lu, Xin;Labrot, Emma S;Hu, Jian;Wang, Wei;Xiao, Yonghong;Zhang, Hailei;Zhang, Jianhua;Zhang, Jingfang;Gan, Boyi;Perry, Samuel R;Jiang, Shan;Li, Liren;Horner, James W;Wang, Y Alan;Chin, Lynda;DePinho, Ronald A"

Here we describe the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the Tasmanian devil genome and whole-genome sequences for two geographically distant subclones of the cancer. Genomic analysis suggests that the cancer first arose from a female Tasmanian devil and that the clone has subsequently genetically diverged during its spread across Tasmania. The devil cancer genome contains more than 17,000 somatic base substitution mutations and bears the imprint of a distinct mutational process. Genotyping of somatic mutations in 104 geographically and temporally distributed Tasmanian devil tumors reveals the pattern of evolution and spread of this parasitic clonal lineage, with evidence of a selective sweep in one geographical area and persistence of parallel lineages in other populations.","Murchison, Elizabeth P;Schulz-Trieglaff, Ole B;Ning, Zemin;Alexandrov, Ludmil B;Bauer, Markus J;Fu, Beiyuan;Hims, Matthew;Ding, Zhihao;Ivakhno, Sergii;Stewart, Caitlin;Ng, Bee Ling;Wong, Wendy;Aken, Bronwen;White, Simon;Alsop, Amber;Becq, Jennifer;Bignell, Graham R;Cheetham, R Keira;Cheng, William;Connor, Thomas R;Cox, Anthony J;Feng, Zhi-Ping;Gu, Yong;Grocock, Russell J;Harris, Simon R;Khrebtukova, Irina;Kingsbury, Zoya;Kowarsky, Mark;Kreiss, Alexandre;Luo, Shujun;Marshall, John;McBride, David J;Murray, Lisa;Pearse, Anne-Maree;Raine, Keiran;Rasolonjatovo, Isabelle;Shaw, Richard;Tedder, Philip;Tregidgo, Carolyn;Vilella, Albert J;Wedge, David C;Woods, Gregory M;Gormley, Niall;Humphray, Sean;Schroth, Gary;Smith, Geoffrey;Hall, Kevin;Searle, Stephen M J;Carter, Nigel P;Papenfuss, Anthony T;Futreal, P Andrew;Campbell, Peter J;Yang, Fengtang;Bentley, David R;Evers, Dirk J;Stratton, Michael R"

Under conditions of immunosuppression, EBV can spread from these cells and cause life-threatening pathologies. We have generated mice expressing the transforming EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), mimicking a constitutively active CD40 coreceptor, specifically in B cells. Like human EBV-infected cells, LMP1+ B cells were efficiently eliminated by T cells, and breaking immune surveillance resulted in rapid, fatal lymphoproliferation and lymphomagenesis. The lymphoma cells expressed ligands for a natural killer (NK) cell receptor, NKG2D, and could be targeted by an NKG2D-Fc fusion protein. These experiments indicate a central role for LMP1 in the surveillance and transformation of EBV-infected B cells in vivo, establish a preclinical model for B cell lymphomagenesis in immunosuppressed patients, and validate a new therapeutic approach.","Zhang, Baochun;Kracker, Sven;Yasuda, Tomoharu;Casola, Stefano;Vanneman, Matthew;Hömig-Hölzel, Cornelia;Wang, Zhe;Derudder, Emmanuel;Li, Shuang;Chakraborty, Tirtha;Cotter, Shane E;Koyama, Shohei;Currie, Treeve;Freeman, Gordon J;Kutok, Jeffery L;Rodig, Scott J;Dranoff, Glenn;Rajewsky, Klaus"
22341439,2012,Cell,TAK1 inhibition promotes apoptosis in KRAS-dependent colon cancers.,"Colon cancers frequently harbor KRAS mutations, yet only a subset of KRAS mutant colon cancer cell lines are dependent upon KRAS signaling for survival. In a screen for kinases that promote survival of KRAS-dependent colon cancer cells, we found that the TAK1 kinase (MAP3K7) is required for tumor cell viability. The induction of apoptosis by RNAi-mediated depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 is linked to its suppression of hyperactivated Wnt signaling, evident in both endogenous and genetically reconstituted cells. In APC mutant/KRAS-dependent cells, KRAS stimulates BMP-7 secretion and BMP signaling, leading to TAK1 activation and enhancement of Wnt-dependent transcription. An in vitro-derived ""TAK1 dependency signature"" is enriched in primary human colon cancers with mutations in both APC and KRAS, suggesting potential clinical utility in stratifying patient populations. Together, these findings identify TAK1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for a treatment-refractory subset of colon cancers exhibiting aberrant KRAS and Wnt pathway activation.","Singh, Anurag;Sweeney, Michael F;Yu, Min;Burger, Alexa;Greninger, Patricia;Benes, Cyril;Haber, Daniel A;Settleman, Jeff"
22304920,2012,Cell,PKCε promotes oncogenic functions of ATF2 in the nucleus while blocking its apoptotic function at mitochondria.,"The transcription factor ATF2 elicits oncogenic activities in melanoma and tumor suppressor activities in nonmalignant skin cancer. Here, we identify that ATF2 tumor suppressor function is determined by its ability to localize at the mitochondria, where it alters membrane permeability following genotoxic stress. The ability of ATF2 to reach the mitochondria is determined by PKCε, which directs ATF2 nuclear localization. Genotoxic stress attenuates PKCε effect on ATF2; enables ATF2 nuclear export and localization at the mitochondria, where it perturbs the HK1-VDAC1 complex; increases mitochondrial permeability; and promotes apoptosis. Significantly, high levels of PKCε, as seen in melanoma cells, block ATF2 nuclear export and function at the mitochondria, thereby attenuating apoptosis following exposure to genotoxic stress. In melanoma tumor samples, high PKCε levels associate with poor prognosis. Overall, our findings provide the framework for understanding how subcellular localization enables ATF2 oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions.","Lau, Eric;Kluger, Harriet;Varsano, Tal;Lee, KiYoung;Scheffler, Immo;Rimm, David L;Ideker, Trey;Ronai, Ze'ev A"

22265421,2012,Cell,Computational modeling of pancreatic cancer reveals kinetics of metastasis suggesting optimum treatment strategies.,"Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death, largely due to metastatic dissemination. We investigated pancreatic cancer progression by utilizing a mathematical framework of metastasis formation together with comprehensive data of 228 patients, 101 of whom had autopsies. We found that pancreatic cancer growth is initially exponential. After estimating the rates of pancreatic cancer growth and dissemination, we determined that patients likely harbor metastases at diagnosis and predicted the number and size distribution of metastases as well as patient survival. These findings were validated in an independent database. Finally, we analyzed the effects of different treatment modalities, finding that therapies that efficiently reduce the growth rate of cells earlier in the course of treatment appear to be superior to upfront tumor resection. These predictions can be validated in the clinic. Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the dynamics of pancreatic cancer metastasis and identifies optimum therapeutic interventions.","Haeno, Hiroshi;Gonen, Mithat;Davis, Meghan B;Herman, Joseph M;Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A;Michor, Franziska"
22265420,2012,Cell,EMT and dissemination precede pancreatic tumor formation.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated death but has been difficult to study because it involves a series of rare, stochastic events. To capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. EMT and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. Conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. These results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating EMT and entry into the circulation.","Rhim, Andrew D;Mirek, Emily T;Aiello, Nicole M;Maitra, Anirban;Bailey, Jennifer M;McAllister, Florencia;Reichert, Maximilian;Beatty, Gregory L;Rustgi, Anil K;Vonderheide, Robert H;Leach, Steven D;Stanger, Ben Z"
22265415,2012,Cell,Mutant p53 disrupts mammary tissue architecture via the mevalonate pathway.,"p53 is a frequent target for mutation in human tumors, and mutant p53 proteins can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a three-dimensional culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo, whereas breast cancer cells display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to a more acinar-like morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via SREBP transcription factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors.

22265403,2012,Cell,Foxa1 and Foxa2 are essential for sexual dimorphism in liver cancer.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sexually dimorphic in both rodents and humans, with significantly higher incidence in males, an effect that is dependent on sex hormones. The molecular mechanisms by which estrogens prevent and androgens promote liver cancer remain unclear. Here, we discover that sexually dimorphic HCC is completely reversed in Foxa1- and Foxa2-deficient mice after diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Coregulation of target genes by Foxa1/a2 and either the estrogen receptor (ERα) or the androgen receptor (AR) was increased during hepatocarcinogenesis in normal female or male mice, respectively, but was lost in Foxa1/2-deficient mice. Thus, both estrogen-dependent resistance to and androgen-mediated facilitation of HCC depend on Foxa1/2. Strikingly, single nucleotide polymorphisms at FOXA2 binding sites reduce binding of both FOXA2 and ERα to their targets in human liver and correlate with HCC development in women. Thus, Foxa factors and their targets are central for the sexual dimorphism of HCC.","Li, Zhaoyu;Tuteja, Geetu;Schug, Jonathan;Kaestner, Klaus H"

We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia.

Here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is critical for TICs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TICs from primary NSCLC tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor LIN28B and GLDC, which are both required for TIC growth and tumorigenesis. Overexpression of GLDC and other glycine/serine enzymes, but not catalytically inactive GLDC, promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. We found that GLDC induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. In the clinic, aberrant activation of GLDC correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients, and aberrant GLDC expression is observed in multiple cancer types. This link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy.","Zhang, Wen Cai;Shyh-Chang, Ng;Yang, He;Rai, Amit;Umashankar, Shivshankar;Ma, Siming;Soh, Boon Seng;Sun, Li Li;Tai, Bee Choo;Nga, Min En;Bhakoo, Kishore Kumar;Jayapal, Senthil Raja;Nichane, Massimo;Yu, Qiang;Ahmed, Dokeu A;Tan, Christie;Sing, Wong Poo;Tam, John;Thirugananam, Agasthian;Noghabi, Monireh Soroush;Pang, Yin Huei;Ang, Haw Siang;Mitchell, Wayne;Robson, Paul;Kaldis, Philipp;Soo, Ross Andrew;Swarup, Sanjay;Lim, Elaine Hsuen;Lim, Bing"

Cancer cells can show perturbed mitotic spindles and an approach in cancer treatment has been to trigger cell killing by targeting microtubule dynamics or spindle assembly. To identify and characterize proteins necessary for spindle assembly, and potential antimitotic targets, we performed a proteomic and genetic analysis of 592 mitotic microtubule copurifying proteins (MMCPs). Screening for regulators that affect both mitosis and apoptosis, we report the identification and characterization of STARD9, a kinesin-3 family member, which localizes to centrosomes and stabilizes the pericentriolar material (PCM). STARD9-depleted cells have fragmented PCM, form multipolar spindles, activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), arrest in mitosis, and undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, STARD9-depletion synergizes with the chemotherapeutic agent taxol to increase mitotic death, demonstrating that STARD9 is a mitotic kinesin and a potential antimitotic target.","Torres, Jorge Z;Summers, Matthew K;Peterson, David;Brauer, Matthew J;Lee, James;Senese, Silvia;Gholkar, Ankur A;Lo, Yu-Chen;Lei, Xingye;Jung, Kenneth;Anderson, David C;Davis, David P;Belmont, Lisa;Jackson, Peter K"

Moreover, we show that, once this circuit is activated, it maintains suppression of HNF4α and sustains oncogenesis. Systemic administration of miR-124, which modulates inflammatory signaling, prevents and suppresses hepatocellular carcinogenesis by inducing tumor-specific apoptosis without toxic side effects. As we also show that this HNF4α circuit is perturbed in human hepatocellular carcinomas, our data raise the possibility that manipulation of this microRNA feedback-inflammatory loop has therapeutic potential for treating liver cancer.","Hatziapostolou, Maria;Polytarchou, Christos;Aggelidou, Eleni;Drakaki, Alexandra;Poultsides, George A;Jaeger, Savina A;Ogata, Hisanobu;Karin, Michael;Struhl, Kevin;Hadzopoulou-Cladaras, Margarita;Iliopoulos, Dimitrios"

Lin28A recruits a TUTase (Zcchc11/TUT4) to let-7 precursors to block processing by Dicer in the cell cytoplasm. Here we find that unlike Lin28A, Lin28B represses let-7 processing through a Zcchc11-independent mechanism. Lin28B functions in the nucleus by sequestering primary let-7 transcripts and inhibiting their processing by the Microprocessor. The inhibitory effects of Zcchc11 depletion on the tumorigenic capacity and metastatic potential of human cancer cells and xenografts are restricted to Lin28A-expressing tumors. Furthermore, the majority of human colon and breast tumors analyzed exclusively express either Lin28A or Lin28B. Lin28A is expressed in HER2-overexpressing breast tumors, whereas Lin28B expression characterizes triple-negative breast tumors.

Here, we describe the cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, protease, and cytokine systems that underlie tissue invasion by cancer cells. We explain how the reciprocal reprogramming of both the tumor cells and the surrounding tissue structures not only guides invasion, but also generates diverse modes of dissemination.

TAZ protein levels and activity are elevated in prospective CSCs and in poorly differentiated human tumors and have prognostic value. Gain of TAZ endows self-renewal capacity to non-CSCs. In epithelial cells, TAZ forms a complex with the cell-polarity determinant Scribble, and loss of Scribble--or induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)--disrupts the inhibitory association of TAZ with the core Hippo kinases MST and LATS.

22036564,2011,Cell,The Eph-receptor A7 is a soluble tumor suppressor for follicular lymphoma.,"Insights into cancer genetics can lead to therapeutic opportunities. By cross-referencing chromosomal changes with an unbiased genetic screen we identify the ephrin receptor A7 (EPHA7) as a tumor suppressor in follicular lymphoma (FL). EPHA7 is a target of 6q deletions and inactivated in 72% of FLs. Knockdown of EPHA7 drives lymphoma development in a murine FL model. In analogy to its physiological function in brain development, a soluble splice variant of EPHA7 (EPHA7(TR)) interferes with another Eph-receptor and blocks oncogenic signals in lymphoma cells. Consistent with this drug-like activity, administration of the purified EPHA7(TR) protein produces antitumor effects against xenografted human lymphomas. Further, by fusing EPHA7(TR) to the anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) we can directly target this tumor suppressor to lymphomas in vivo.

22000016,2011,Cell,In vivo identification of tumor- suppressive PTEN ceRNAs in an oncogenic BRAF-induced mouse model of melanoma.,"We recently proposed that competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) sequester microRNAs to regulate mRNA transcripts containing common microRNA recognition elements (MREs). However, the functional role of ceRNAs in cancer remains unknown. Loss of PTEN, a tumor suppressor regulated by ceRNA activity, frequently occurs in melanoma. Here, we report the discovery of significant enrichment of putative PTEN ceRNAs among genes whose loss accelerates tumorigenesis following Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of melanoma. We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels. Our study genetically identifies multiple putative microRNA decoys for PTEN, validates ZEB2 mRNA as a bona fide PTEN ceRNA, and demonstrates that abrogated ZEB2 expression cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanomagenesis.","Karreth, Florian A;Tay, Yvonne;Perna, Daniele;Ala, Ugo;Tan, Shen Mynn;Rust, Alistair G;DeNicola, Gina;Webster, Kaitlyn A;Weiss, Dror;Perez-Mancera, Pedro A;Krauthammer, Michael;Halaban, Ruth;Provero, Paolo;Adams, David J;Tuveson, David A;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo"
22000015,2011,Cell,An extensive microRNA-mediated network of RNA-RNA interactions regulates established oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma.,"By analyzing gene expression data in glioblastoma in combination with matched microRNA profiles, we have uncovered a posttranscriptional regulation layer of surprising magnitude, comprising more than 248,000 microRNA (miR)-mediated interactions. These include ∼7,000 genes whose transcripts act as miR ""sponges"" and 148 genes that act through alternative, nonsponge interactions. Biochemical analyses in cell lines confirmed that this network regulates established drivers of tumor initiation and subtype implementation, including PTEN, PDGFRA, RB1, VEGFA, STAT3, and RUNX1, suggesting that these interactions mediate crosstalk between canonical oncogenic pathways. siRNA silencing of 13 miR-mediated PTEN regulators, whose locus deletions are predictive of PTEN expression variability, was sufficient to downregulate PTEN in a 3'UTR-dependent manner and to increase tumor cell growth rates. Thus, miR-mediated interactions provide a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for the loss of PTEN expression in a large number of glioma samples with an intact PTEN locus.","Sumazin, Pavel;Yang, Xuerui;Chiu, Hua-Sheng;Chung, Wei-Jen;Iyer, Archana;Llobet-Navas, David;Rajbhandari, Presha;Bansal, Mukesh;Guarnieri, Paolo;Silva, Jose;Califano, Andrea"

However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis.

Each of these events is driven by the acquisition of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations within tumor cells and the co-option of nonneoplastic stromal cells, which together endow incipient metastatic cells with traits needed to generate macroscopic metastases.

ID ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation occur in differentiated tissues, but IDs in many neoplasms appear to escape degradation. We show that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 promotes ID protein stability and stem cell-like characteristics in osteosarcoma. USP1 bound, deubiquitinated, and thereby stabilized ID1, ID2, and ID3. A subset of primary human osteosarcomas coordinately overexpressed USP1 and ID proteins. USP1 knockdown in osteosarcoma cells precipitated ID protein destabilization, cell-cycle arrest, and osteogenic differentiation. Conversely, ectopic USP1 expression in mesenchymal stem cells stabilized ID proteins, inhibited osteoblastic differentiation, and enhanced proliferation. Consistent with USP1 functioning in normal mesenchymal stem cells, USP1-deficient mice were osteopenic. Our observations implicate USP1 in preservation of the stem cell state that characterizes osteosarcoma and identify USP1 as a target for differentiation therapy.","Williams, Samuel A;Maecker, Heather L;French, Dorothy M;Liu, Jinfeng;Gregg, Andrew;Silverstein, Leah B;Cao, Tim C;Carano, Richard A D;Dixit, Vishva M"

Recently, a chromosome catastrophe phenomenon termed chromothripsis, in which numerous genomic rearrangements are apparently acquired in one single catastrophic event, was described in multiple cancers. Here, we show that constitutionally acquired CGRs share similarities with cancer chromothripsis. In the 17 CGR cases investigated, we observed localization and multiple copy number changes including deletions, duplications, and/or triplications, as well as extensive translocations and inversions. Genomic rearrangements involved varied in size and complexities; in one case, array comparative genomic hybridization revealed 18 copy number changes. Breakpoint sequencing identified characteristic features, including small templated insertions at breakpoints and microhomology at breakpoint junctions, which have been attributed to replicative processes. The resemblance between CGR and chromothripsis suggests similar mechanistic underpinnings.

21889194,2011,Cell,BET bromodomain inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc.,"MYC contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted MYC transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to RNA polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, we identify BET bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of JQ1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for BET bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.","Delmore, Jake E;Issa, Ghayas C;Lemieux, Madeleine E;Rahl, Peter B;Shi, Junwei;Jacobs, Hannah M;Kastritis, Efstathios;Gilpatrick, Timothy;Paranal, Ronald M;Qi, Jun;Chesi, Marta;Schinzel, Anna C;McKeown, Michael R;Heffernan, Timothy P;Vakoc, Christopher R;Bergsagel, P Leif;Ghobrial, Irene M;Richardson, Paul G;Young, Richard A;Hahn, William C;Anderson, Kenneth C;Kung, Andrew L;Bradner, James E;Mitsiades, Constantine S"

We show a converse role for AKT/FOXOs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Rather than decreased FOXO activity, we observed that FOXOs are active in ∼40% of AML patient samples regardless of genetic subtype. We also observe this activity in human MLL-AF9 leukemia allele-induced AML in mice, where either activation of Akt or compound deletion of FoxO1/3/4 reduced leukemic cell growth, with the latter markedly diminishing leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) function in vivo and improving animal survival. FOXO inhibition resulted in myeloid maturation and subsequent AML cell death. FOXO activation inversely correlated with JNK/c-JUN signaling, and leukemic cells resistant to FOXO inhibition responded to JNK inhibition. These data reveal a molecular role for AKT/FOXO and JNK/c-JUN in maintaining a differentiation blockade that can be targeted to inhibit leukemias with a range of genetic lesions.","Sykes, Stephen M;Lane, Steven W;Bullinger, Lars;Kalaitzidis, Demetrios;Yusuf, Rushdia;Saez, Borja;Ferraro, Francesca;Mercier, Francois;Singh, Harshabad;Brumme, Kristina M;Acharya, Sanket S;Scholl, Claudia;Schöll, Claudia;Tothova, Zuzana;Attar, Eyal C;Fröhling, Stefan;DePinho, Ronald A;Armstrong, Scott A;Gilliland, D Gary;Scadden, David T"
21854987,2011,Cell,Stochastic state transitions give rise to phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.,"Cancer cells within individual tumors often exist in distinct phenotypic states that differ in functional attributes. While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.","Gupta, Piyush B;Fillmore, Christine M;Jiang, Guozhi;Shapira, Sagi D;Tao, Kai;Kuperwasser, Charlotte;Lander, Eric S"

Thus, an ideal approach to identify the cell of origin is to analyze proliferative abnormalities in distinct lineages prior to malignancy. Here, we use mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) in mice to model gliomagenesis by initiating concurrent p53/Nf1 mutations sporadically in neural stem cells (NSCs). Surprisingly, MADM-based lineage tracing revealed significant aberrant growth prior to malignancy only in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but not in any other NSC-derived lineages or NSCs themselves. Upon tumor formation, phenotypic and transcriptome analyses of tumor cells revealed salient OPC features. Finally, introducing the same p53/Nf1 mutations directly into OPCs consistently led to gliomagenesis. Our findings suggest OPCs as the cell of origin in this model, even when initial mutations occur in NSCs, and highlight the importance of analyzing premalignant stages to identify the cancer cell of origin.","Liu, Chong;Sage, Jonathan C;Miller, Michael R;Verhaak, Roel G W;Hippenmeyer, Simon;Vogel, Hannes;Foreman, Oded;Bronson, Roderick T;Nishiyama, Akiko;Luo, Liqun;Zong, Hui"
21729786,2011,Cell,Biomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasis.,"Mechanotransduction is a key determinant of tissue homeostasis and tumor progression. It is driven by intercellular adhesions, cell contractility, and forces generated within the microenvironment and is dependent on extracellular matrix composition, organization, and compliance. We show that caveolin-1 (Cav1) favors cell elongation in three-dimensional cultures and promotes Rho- and force-dependent contraction, matrix alignment, and microenvironment stiffening through regulation of p190RhoGAP. In turn, microenvironment remodeling by Cav1 fibroblasts forces cell elongation. Cav1-deficient mice have disorganized stromal tissue architecture. Stroma associated with human carcinomas and melanoma metastases is enriched in Cav1-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Cav1 expression in breast CAFs correlates with low survival, and Cav1 depletion in CAFs decreases CAF contractility. Consistently, fibroblast expression of Cav1, through p190RhoGAP regulation, favors directional migration and invasiveness of carcinoma cells in vitro. In vivo, stromal Cav1 remodels peri- and intratumoral microenvironments to facilitate tumor invasion, correlating with increased metastatic potency. Thus, Cav1 modulates tissue responses through force-dependent architectural regulation of the microenvironment.","Goetz, Jacky G;Minguet, Susana;Navarro-Lérida, Inmaculada;Lazcano, Juan José;Samaniego, Rafael;Calvo, Enrique;Tello, Marta;Osteso-Ibáñez, Teresa;Pellinen, Teijo;Echarri, Asier;Cerezo, Ana;Klein-Szanto, Andres J P;Garcia, Ricardo;Keely, Patricia J;Sánchez-Mateos, Paloma;Cukierman, Edna;Del Pozo, Miguel A"

As in other cancers, recent studies have identified highly tumorigenic subpopulations within malignant gliomas, known generally as cancer stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that glioma stem cells (GSCs) produce nitric oxide via elevated nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) expression. GSCs depend on NOS2 activity for growth and tumorigenicity, distinguishing them from non-GSCs and normal neural progenitors. Gene expression profiling identified many NOS2-regulated genes, including the cell-cycle inhibitor cell division autoantigen-1 (CDA1). Further, high NOS2 expression correlates with decreased survival in human glioma patients, and NOS2 inhibition slows glioma growth in a murine intracranial model. These data provide insight into how GSCs are mechanistically distinct from their less tumorigenic counterparts and suggest that NOS2 inhibition may be an efficacious approach to treating this devastating disease.","Eyler, Christine E;Wu, Qiulian;Yan, Kenneth;MacSwords, Jennifer M;Chandler-Militello, Devin;Misuraca, Katherine L;Lathia, Justin D;Forrester, Michael T;Lee, Jeongwu;Stamler, Jonathan S;Goldman, Steven A;Bredel, Markus;McLendon, Roger E;Sloan, Andrew E;Hjelmeland, Anita B;Rich, Jeremy N"

We show here that p63 null embryos rapidly develop intestine-like metaplasia with gene expression profiles similar to Barrett's metaplasia. We track its source to a unique embryonic epithelium that is normally undermined and replaced by p63-expressing cells. Significantly, we show that a discrete population of these embryonic cells persists in adult mice and humans at the squamocolumnar junction, the source of Barrett's metaplasia. We show that upon programmed damage to the squamous epithelium, these embryonic cells migrate toward adjacent, specialized squamous cells in a process that may recapitulate early Barrett's.

During both normal development and tumor pathogenesis, this change in cell phenotype is induced by contextual signals that epithelial cells receive from their microenvironment. The signals that are responsible for inducing an EMT and maintaining the resulting cellular state have been unclear. We describe three signaling pathways, involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling, that collaborate to induce activation of the EMT program and thereafter function in an autocrine fashion to maintain the resulting mesenchymal state. Downregulation of endogenously synthesized inhibitors of autocrine signals in epithelial cells enables the induction of the EMT program. Conversely, disruption of autocrine signaling by added inhibitors of these pathways inhibits migration and self-renewal in primary mammary epithelial cells and reduces tumorigenicity and metastasis by their transformed derivatives.","Scheel, Christina;Eaton, Elinor Ng;Li, Sophia Hsin-Jung;Chaffer, Christine L;Reinhardt, Ferenc;Kah, Kong-Jie;Bell, George;Guo, Wenjun;Rubin, Jeffrey;Richardson, Andrea L;Weinberg, Robert A"
21620138,2011,Cell,Pyruvate kinase M2 is a PHD3-stimulated coactivator for hypoxia-inducible factor 1.,"The pyruvate kinase isoforms PKM1 and PKM2 are alternatively spliced products of the PKM2 gene. PKM2, but not PKM1, alters glucose metabolism in cancer cells and contributes to tumorigenesis by mechanisms that are not explained by its known biochemical activity. We show that PKM2 gene transcription is activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). PKM2 interacts directly with the HIF-1α subunit and promotes transactivation of HIF-1 target genes by enhancing HIF-1 binding and p300 recruitment to hypoxia response elements, whereas PKM1 fails to regulate HIF-1 activity. Interaction of PKM2 with prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) enhances PKM2 binding to HIF-1α and PKM2 coactivator function. Mass spectrometry and anti-hydroxyproline antibody assays demonstrate PKM2 hydroxylation on proline-403/408. PHD3 knockdown inhibits PKM2 coactivator function, reduces glucose uptake and lactate production, and increases O(2) consumption in cancer cells. Thus, PKM2 participates in a positive feedback loop that promotes HIF-1 transactivation and reprograms glucose metabolism in cancer cells.","Luo, Weibo;Hu, Hongxia;Chang, Ryan;Zhong, Jun;Knabel, Matthew;O'Meally, Robert;Cole, Robert N;Pandey, Akhilesh;Semenza, Gregg L"

In addition to protein-coding genes, estrogen regulates the distribution and activity of all three RNA polymerases and virtually every class of noncoding RNA that has been described to date.

Aberrant activation of this pathway by HPV-16 E6/E7 or cyclin E oncogenes significantly decreased the cellular nucleotide levels in the newly transformed cells. Exogenously supplied nucleosides rescued the replication stress and DNA damage and dramatically decreased oncogene-induced transformation. Increased transcription of nucleotide biosynthesis genes, mediated by expressing the transcription factor c-myc, increased the nucleotide pool and also rescued the replication-induced DNA damage.

Using a genetic screen, we identify the PTPN12 tyrosine phosphatase as a tumor suppressor in TNBC. PTPN12 potently suppresses mammary epithelial cell proliferation and transformation. PTPN12 is frequently compromised in human TNBCs, and we identify an upstream tumor-suppressor network that posttranscriptionally controls PTPN12. PTPN12 suppresses transformation by interacting with and inhibiting multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases, including HER2 and EGFR. The tumorigenic and metastatic potential of PTPN12-deficient TNBC cells is severely impaired upon restoration of PTPN12 function or combined inhibition of PTPN12-regulated tyrosine kinases, suggesting that TNBCs are dependent on the proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinases constrained by PTPN12.

They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction.

These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2%-3% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in ∼25% of bone cancers.

Specifically, IL-6 and Timp-1 are released in the thymus in response to DNA damage, creating a ""chemo-resistant niche"" that promotes the survival of a minimal residual tumor burden and serves as a reservoir for eventual tumor relapse. Notably, IL-6 is released acutely from thymic endothelial cells in a p38-dependent manner following genotoxic stress, and this acute secretory response precedes the gradual induction of senescence in tumor-associated stromal cells. Thus, conventional chemotherapies can induce tumor regression while simultaneously eliciting stress responses that protect subsets of tumor cells in select anatomical locations from drug action.","Gilbert, Luke A;Hemann, Michael T"
20946988,2010,Cell,A Myc network accounts for similarities between embryonic stem and cancer cell transcription programs.,"c-Myc (Myc) is an important transcriptional regulator in embryonic stem (ES) cells, somatic cell reprogramming, and cancer. Here, we identify a Myc-centered regulatory network in ES cells by combining protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction studies and show that Myc interacts with the NuA4 complex, a regulator of ES cell identity. In combination with regulatory network information, we define three ES cell modules (Core, Polycomb, and Myc) and show that the modules are functionally separable, illustrating that the overall ES cell transcription program is composed of distinct units. With these modules as an analytical tool, we have reassessed the hypothesis linking an ES cell signature with cancer or cancer stem cells. We find that the Myc module, independent of the Core module, is active in various cancers and predicts cancer outcome. The apparent similarity of cancer and ES cell signatures reflects, in large part, the pervasive nature of Myc regulatory networks.","Kim, Jonghwan;Woo, Andrew J;Chu, Jianlin;Snow, Jonathan W;Fujiwara, Yuko;Kim, Chul Geun;Cantor, Alan B;Orkin, Stuart H"
20946980,2010,Cell,Cytohesins are cytoplasmic ErbB receptor activators.,"Signaling by ErbB receptors requires the activation of their cytoplasmic kinase domains, which is initiated by ligand binding to the receptor ectodomains. Cytoplasmic factors contributing to the activation are unknown. Here we identify members of the cytohesin protein family as such factors. Cytohesin inhibition decreased ErbB receptor autophosphorylation and signaling, whereas cytohesin overexpression stimulated receptor activation. Monitoring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) conformation by anisotropy microscopy together with cell-free reconstitution of cytohesin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation indicate that cytohesins facilitate conformational rearrangements in the intracellular domains of dimerized receptors. Consistent with cytohesins playing a prominent role in ErbB receptor signaling, we found that cytohesin overexpression correlated with EGF signaling pathway activation in human lung adenocarcinomas. Chemical inhibition of cytohesins resulted in reduced proliferation of EGFR-dependent lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results establish cytohesins as cytoplasmic conformational activators of ErbB receptors that are of pathophysiological relevance.","Bill, Anke;Schmitz, Anton;Albertoni, Barbara;Song, Jin-Na;Heukamp, Lukas C;Walrafen, David;Thorwirth, Franziska;Verveer, Peter J;Zimmer, Sebastian;Meffert, Lisa;Schreiber, Arne;Chatterjee, Sampurna;Thomas, Roman K;Ullrich, Roland T;Lang, Thorsten;Famulok, Michael"
20887894,2010,Cell,Store-independent activation of Orai1 by SPCA2 in mammary tumors.,"Ca(2+) is an essential and ubiquitous second messenger. Changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) trigger events critical for tumorigenesis, such as cellular motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. We show that an isoform of Secretory Pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase, SPCA2, is upregulated in breast cancer-derived cells and human breast tumors, and suppression of SPCA2 attenuates basal Ca(2+) levels and tumorigenicity. Contrary to its conventional role in Golgi Ca(2+) sequestration, expression of SPCA2 increased Ca(2+) influx by a mechanism dependent on the store-operated Ca(2+) channel Orai1. Unexpectedly, SPCA2-Orai1 signaling was independent of ER Ca(2+) stores or STIM1 and STIM2 sensors and uncoupled from Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of SPCA2. Binding of the SPCA2 amino terminus to Orai1 enabled access of its carboxyl terminus to Orai1 and activation of Ca(2+) influx. Our findings reveal a signaling pathway in which the Orai1-SPCA2 complex elicits constitutive store-independent Ca(2+) signaling that promotes tumorigenesis.","Feng, Mingye;Grice, Desma M;Faddy, Helen M;Nguyen, Nguyen;Leitch, Sharon;Wang, Yingyu;Muend, Sabina;Kenny, Paraic A;Sukumar, Saraswati;Roberts-Thomson, Sarah J;Monteith, Gregory R;Rao, Rajini"
20850014,2010,Cell,DNA demethylase activity maintains intestinal cells in an undifferentiated state following loss of APC.,"Although genome-wide hypomethylation is a hallmark of many cancers, roles for active DNA demethylation during tumorigenesis are unknown. Here, loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene causes upregulation of a DNA demethylase system and the concomitant hypomethylation of key intestinal cell fating genes. Notably, this hypomethylation maintained zebrafish intestinal cells in an undifferentiated state that was released upon knockdown of demethylase components. Mechanistically, the demethylase genes are directly activated by Pou5f1 and Cebpβ and are indirectly repressed by retinoic acid, which antagonizes Pou5f1 and Cebpβ. Apc mutants lack retinoic acid as a result of the transcriptional repression of retinol dehydrogenase l1 via a complex that includes Lef1, Groucho2, Ctbp1, Lsd1, and Corest. Our findings imply a model wherein APC controls intestinal cell fating through a switch in DNA methylation dynamics. Wild-type APC and retinoic acid downregulate demethylase components, thereby promoting DNA methylation of key genes and helping progenitors commit to differentiation.","Rai, Kunal;Sarkar, Sharmistha;Broadbent, Talmage J;Voas, Matthew;Grossmann, Kenneth F;Nadauld, Lincoln D;Dehghanizadeh, Somaye;Hagos, Fanuel T;Li, Yumei;Toth, Rachel K;Chidester, Stephanie;Bahr, Timothy M;Johnson, W Evan;Sklow, Brad;Burt, Randall;Cairns, Bradley R;Jones, David A"

Rituximab and other antibodies are not curative and must be combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy for clinical benefit. Here we report the eradication of human NHL solely with a monoclonal antibody therapy combining rituximab with a blocking anti-CD47 antibody. We identified increased expression of CD47 on human NHL cells and determined that higher CD47 expression independently predicted adverse clinical outcomes in multiple NHL subtypes. Blocking anti-CD47 antibodies preferentially enabled phagocytosis of NHL cells and synergized with rituximab. Treatment of human NHL-engrafted mice with anti-CD47 antibody reduced lymphoma burden and improved survival, while combination treatment with rituximab led to elimination of lymphoma and cure. These antibodies synergized through a mechanism combining Fc receptor (FcR)-dependent and FcR-independent stimulation of phagocytosis that might be applicable to many other cancers.","Chao, Mark P;Alizadeh, Ash A;Tang, Chad;Myklebust, June H;Varghese, Bindu;Gill, Saar;Jan, Max;Cha, Adriel C;Chan, Charles K;Tan, Brent T;Park, Christopher Y;Zhao, Feifei;Kohrt, Holbrook E;Malumbres, Raquel;Briones, Javier;Gascoyne, Randy D;Lossos, Izidore S;Levy, Ronald;Weissman, Irving L;Majeti, Ravindra"
20723755,2010,Cell,Reversal of cancer cachexia and muscle wasting by ActRIIB antagonism leads to prolonged survival.,"Muscle wasting and cachexia have long been postulated to be key determinants of cancer-related death, but there has been no direct experimental evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. Here, we show that in several cancer cachexia models, pharmacological blockade of ActRIIB pathway not only prevents further muscle wasting but also completely reverses prior loss of skeletal muscle and cancer-induced cardiac atrophy. This treatment dramatically prolongs survival, even of animals in which tumor growth is not inhibited and fat loss and production of proinflammatory cytokines are not reduced. ActRIIB pathway blockade abolished the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the induction of atrophy-specific ubiquitin ligases in muscles and also markedly stimulated muscle stem cell growth. These findings establish a crucial link between activation of the ActRIIB pathway and the development of cancer cachexia. Thus ActRIIB antagonism is a promising new approach for treating cancer cachexia, whose inhibition per se prolongs survival.","Zhou, Xiaolan;Wang, Jin Lin;Lu, John;Song, Yanping;Kwak, Keith S;Jiao, Qingsheng;Rosenfeld, Robert;Chen, Qing;Boone, Thomas;Simonet, W Scott;Lacey, David L;Goldberg, Alfred L;Han, H Q"
20655465,2010,Cell,NF1 is a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma that determines retinoic acid response and disease outcome.,"Retinoic acid (RA) induces differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and is used with variable success to treat aggressive forms of this disease. This variability in clinical response to RA is enigmatic, as no mutations in components of the RA signaling cascade have been found. Using a large-scale RNAi genetic screen, we identify crosstalk between the tumor suppressor NF1 and retinoic acid-induced differentiation in neuroblastoma. Loss of NF1 activates RAS-MEK signaling, which in turn represses ZNF423, a critical transcriptional coactivator of the retinoic acid receptors. Neuroblastomas with low levels of both NF1 and ZNF423 have extremely poor outcome. We find NF1 mutations in neuroblastoma cell lines and in primary tumors. Inhibition of MEK signaling downstream of NF1 restores responsiveness to RA, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to overcome RA resistance in NF1-deficient neuroblastomas.","Hölzel, Michael;Huang, Sidong;Koster, Jan;Ora, Ingrid;Lakeman, Arjan;Caron, Huib;Nijkamp, Wouter;Xie, Jing;Callens, Tom;Asgharzadeh, Shahab;Seeger, Robert C;Messiaen, Ludwine;Versteeg, Rogier;Bernards, René"
20603014,2010,Cell,Environmental and genetic activation of a brain-adipocyte BDNF/leptin axis causes cancer remission and inhibition.,"Cancer is influenced by its microenvironment, yet broader, environmental effects also play a role but remain poorly defined. We report here that mice living in an enriched housing environment show reduced tumor growth and increased remission. We found this effect in melanoma and colon cancer models, and that it was not caused by physical activity alone. Serum from animals held in an enriched environment (EE) inhibited cancer proliferation in vitro and was markedly lower in leptin. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was selectively upregulated by EE, and its genetic overexpression reduced tumor burden, whereas BDNF knockdown blocked the effect of EE. Mechanistically, we show that hypothalamic BDNF downregulated leptin production in adipocytes via sympathoneural beta-adrenergic signaling. These results suggest that genetic or environmental activation of this BDNF/leptin axis may have therapeutic significance for cancer.","Cao, Lei;Liu, Xianglan;Lin, En-Ju D;Wang, Chuansong;Choi, Eugene Y;Riban, Veronique;Lin, Benjamin;During, Matthew J"
20603000,2010,Cell,A MicroRNA targeting dicer for metastasis control.,"Although specific microRNAs (miRNAs) can be upregulated in cancer, global miRNA downregulation is a common trait of human malignancies. The mechanisms of this phenomenon and the advantages it affords remain poorly understood. Here we identify a microRNA family, miR-103/107, that attenuates miRNA biosynthesis by targeting Dicer, a key component of the miRNA processing machinery. In human breast cancer, high levels of miR-103/107 are associated with metastasis and poor outcome. Functionally, miR-103/107 confer migratory capacities in vitro and empower metastatic dissemination of otherwise nonaggressive cells in vivo. Inhibition of miR-103/107 opposes migration and metastasis of malignant cells. At the cellular level, a key event fostered by miR-103/107 is induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), attained by downregulating miR-200 levels. These findings suggest a new pathway by which Dicer inhibition drifts epithelial cancer toward a less-differentiated, mesenchymal fate to foster metastasis.","Martello, Graziano;Rosato, Antonio;Ferrari, Francesco;Manfrin, Andrea;Cordenonsi, Michelangelo;Dupont, Sirio;Enzo, Elena;Guzzardo, Vincenza;Rondina, Maria;Spruce, Thomas;Parenti, Anna R;Daidone, Maria Grazia;Bicciato, Silvio;Piccolo, Stefano"
20478260,2010,Cell,IGFBP7 is not required for B-RAF-induced melanocyte senescence.,"Induction of senescence permanently restricts cellular proliferation after oncogenic stimulation thereby acting as a potent barrier to tumor development. The relevant effector proteins may therefore be fundamental to cancer development. A recent study identified IGFBP7 as a secreted factor mediating melanocyte senescence induced by oncogenic B-RAF, which is found commonly in cutaneous nevi. In contrast to the previous report, we demonstrate that B-RAF signaling does not induce IGFBP7 expression, nor the expression of the IGFBP7 targets, BNIP3L, SMARCB1, or PEA15, in human melanocytes or fibroblasts. We also found no correlation between B-RAF mutational status and IGFBP7 protein expression levels in 22 melanoma cell lines, 90 melanomas, and 46 benign nevi. Furthermore, using a lentiviral silencing strategy we show that B-RAF induces senescence in melanocytes and fibroblasts, irrespective of the presence of IGFBP7. Therefore, we conclude that the secreted protein IGFBP7 is dispensable for B-RAF(V600E)-induced senescence in human melanocytes.","Scurr, Lyndee L;Pupo, Gulietta M;Becker, Therese M;Lai, Ken;Schrama, David;Haferkamp, Sebastian;Irvine, Mal;Scolyer, Richard A;Mann, Graham J;Becker, Jürgen C;Kefford, Richard F;Rizos, Helen"
20478252,2010,Cell,A temporarily distinct subpopulation of slow-cycling melanoma cells is required for continuous tumor growth.,"Melanomas are highly heterogeneous tumors, but the biological significance of their different subpopulations is not clear. Using the H3K4 demethylase JARID1B (KDM5B/PLU-1/RBP2-H1) as a biomarker, we have characterized a small subpopulation of slow-cycling melanoma cells that cycle with doubling times of >4 weeks within the rapidly proliferating main population. Isolated JARID1B-positive melanoma cells give rise to a highly proliferative progeny. Knockdown of JARID1B leads to an initial acceleration of tumor growth followed by exhaustion which suggests that the JARID1B-positive subpopulation is essential for continuous tumor growth. Expression of JARID1B is dynamically regulated and does not follow a hierarchical cancer stem cell model because JARID1B-negative cells can become positive and even single melanoma cells irrespective of selection are tumorigenic. These results suggest a new understanding of melanoma heterogeneity with tumor maintenance as a dynamic process mediated by a temporarily distinct subpopulation.","Roesch, Alexander;Fukunaga-Kalabis, Mizuho;Schmidt, Elizabeth C;Zabierowski, Susan E;Brafford, Patricia A;Vultur, Adina;Basu, Devraj;Gimotty, Phyllis;Vogt, Thomas;Herlyn, Meenhard"

Also, genetic ablation of the tyrosine kinase domain of VEGFR-1 in the host did not result in growth inhibition of the anti-VEGF-A sensitive or resistant tumors tested. Furthermore, combination of anti-PlGF with anti-VEGF-A antibodies did not result in greater antitumor efficacy than anti-VEGF-A monotherapy. In conclusion, our data argue against an important role of PlGF during primary tumor growth in most models and suggest that clinical evaluation of anti-PlGF antibodies may be challenging.","Bais, Carlos;Wu, Xiumin;Yao, Jenny;Yang, Suya;Crawford, Yongping;McCutcheon, Krista;Tan, Christine;Kolumam, Ganesh;Vernes, Jean-Michel;Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey;Haughney, Peter;Kowanetz, Marcin;Hagenbeek, Thijs;Kasman, Ian;Reslan, Hani Bou;Ross, Jed;Van Bruggen, Nick;Carano, Richard A D;Meng, Yu-Ju Gloria;Hongo, Jo-Anne;Stephan, Jean-Philippe;Shibuya, Masabumi;Ferrara, Napoleone"
20371347,2010,Cell,Persistent telomere damage induces bypass of mitosis and tetraploidy.,"Tetraploidization has been proposed as an intermediate step toward aneuploidy in human cancer but a general mechanism for the induction of tetraploidy during tumorigenesis is lacking. We report that tetraploidization occurs in p53-deficient cells experiencing a prolonged DNA damage signal due to persistent telomere dysfunction. Live-cell imaging revealed that these cells have an extended G2 due to ATM/ATR- and Chk1/Chk2-mediated inhibition of Cdk1/CyclinB and eventually bypass mitosis. Despite their lack of mitosis, the cells showed APC/Cdh1-dependent degradation of the replication inhibitor geminin, followed by accumulation of Cdt1, which is required for origin licensing. Cells then entered a second S phase resulting in whole-genome reduplication and tetraploidy. Upon restoration of telomere protection, these tetraploid cells resumed cell division cycles and proliferated. These observations suggest a general mechanism for the induction of tetraploidization in the early stages of tumorigenesis when telomere dysfunction can result from excessive telomere shortening.","Davoli, Teresa;Denchi, Eros Lazzerini;de Lange, Titia"
20371346,2010,Cell,A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations.,"Accumulating evidence implicates heterogeneity within cancer cell populations in the response to stressful exposures, including drug treatments. While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly ""drug-tolerant"" cells. These cells demonstrate >100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures.","Sharma, Sreenath V;Lee, Diana Y;Li, Bihua;Quinlan, Margaret P;Takahashi, Fumiyuki;Maheswaran, Shyamala;McDermott, Ultan;Azizian, Nancy;Zou, Lee;Fischbach, Michael A;Wong, Kwok-Kin;Brandstetter, Kathleyn;Wittner, Ben;Ramaswamy, Sridhar;Classon, Marie;Settleman, Jeff"

In cancer, altered proteolysis leads to unregulated tumor growth, tissue remodeling, inflammation, tissue invasion, and metastasis. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) represent the most prominent family of proteinases associated with tumorigenesis. Recent technological developments have markedly advanced our understanding of MMPs as modulators of the tumor microenvironment. In addition to their role in extracellular matrix turnover and cancer cell migration, MMPs regulate signaling pathways that control cell growth, inflammation, or angiogenesis and may even work in a nonproteolytic manner.

During tumor initiation, they create an inflammatory environment that is mutagenic and promotes growth. As tumors progress to malignancy, macrophages stimulate angiogenesis, enhance tumor cell migration and invasion, and suppress antitumor immunity. At metastatic sites, macrophages prepare the target tissue for arrival of tumor cells, and then a different subpopulation of macrophages promotes tumor cell extravasation, survival, and subsequent growth.

Here, we highlight recent advances toward understanding the origin of chromosomal translocations in incipient lymphoid cancers and how tumor-suppressive pathways normally limit the frequency of these aberrant recombination events.

Here, we report that loss of miR-328 occurs in blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BC) in a BCR/ABL dose- and kinase-dependent manner through the MAPK-hnRNP E2 pathway. Restoration of miR-328 expression rescues differentiation and impairs survival of leukemic blasts by simultaneously interacting with the translational regulator poly(rC)-binding protein hnRNP E2 and with the mRNA encoding the survival factor PIM1, respectively. The interaction with hnRNP E2 is independent of the microRNA's seed sequence and it leads to release of CEBPA mRNA from hnRNP E2-mediated translational inhibition. Altogether, these data reveal the dual ability of a microRNA to control cell fate both through base pairing with mRNA targets and through a decoy activity that interferes with the function of regulatory proteins.","Eiring, Anna M;Harb, Jason G;Neviani, Paolo;Garton, Christopher;Oaks, Joshua J;Spizzo, Riccardo;Liu, Shujun;Schwind, Sebastian;Santhanam, Ramasamy;Hickey, Christopher J;Becker, Heiko;Chandler, Jason C;Andino, Raul;Cortes, Jorge;Hokland, Peter;Huettner, Claudia S;Bhatia, Ravi;Roy, Denis C;Liebhaber, Stephen A;Caligiuri, Michael A;Marcucci, Guido;Garzon, Ramiro;Croce, Carlo M;Calin, George A;Perrotti, Danilo"

Here, we show that the closed, growth-inhibitory form of Merlin accumulates in the nucleus, binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1), and suppresses its activity. Depletion of DCAF1 blocks the promitogenic effect of inactivation of Merlin. Conversely, enforced expression of a Merlin-insensitive mutant of DCAF1 counteracts the antimitogenic effect of Merlin. Re-expression of Merlin and silencing of DCAF1 implement a similar, tumor-suppressive program of gene expression. Tumor-derived mutations invariably disrupt Merlin's ability to interact with or inhibit CRL4(DCAF1). Finally, depletion of DCAF1 inhibits the hyperproliferation of Schwannoma cells from NF2 patients and suppresses the oncogenic potential of Merlin-deficient tumor cell lines. We propose that Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by translocating to the nucleus to inhibit CRL4(DCAF1).","Li, Wei;You, Liru;Cooper, Jonathan;Schiavon, Gaia;Pepe-Caprio, Angela;Zhou, Lu;Ishii, Ryohei;Giovannini, Marco;Hanemann, C Oliver;Long, Stephen B;Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye;Zhou, Pengbo;Tempst, Paul;Giancotti, Filippo G"
20141840,2010,Cell,Autocrine VEGF signaling synergizes with EGFR in tumor cells to promote epithelial cancer development.,"It is established that tumor cell-derived VEGF acts on endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. Here, we demonstrate that in K5-SOS-dependent mouse skin tumors, autocrine VEGF is required for tumor cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous and angiogenesis-independent manner. VEGF is upregulated in SOS-expressing tumors, and its deletion in epidermal cells delays tumorigenesis by suppressing angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Epidermis-specific Flt1 deletion also impairs tumorigenesis and proliferation. Surprisingly, complete tumor inhibition occurs in the absence of VEGF in EGFR mutant mice, demonstrating that VEGFR and EGFR synergize in neoplastic cells to promote tumor growth. Mechanistically, K5-SOS upregulates VEGF, Flt1, and Neuropilin-1 in an Erk-dependent manner, thereby activating an autocrine proliferation loop, whereas EGFR prevents tumor cells from apoptosis. Moreover, Flt1 is upregulated in human SCC, and its inhibition in SCC cells impairs proliferation. Thus, in addition to regulating angiogenesis, VEGF has to be considered as a potent growth factor for epidermal tumors.","Lichtenberger, Beate M;Tan, Poi Kiang;Niederleithner, Heide;Ferrara, Napoleone;Petzelbauer, Peter;Sibilia, Maria"

This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice.

We now demonstrate that either dietary or genetic obesity is a potent bona fide liver tumor promoter in mice. Obesity-promoted HCC development was dependent on enhanced production of the tumor-promoting cytokines IL-6 and TNF, which cause hepatic inflammation and activation of the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. The chronic inflammatory response caused by obesity and enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF may also increase the risk of other cancers.","Park, Eek Joong;Lee, Jun Hee;Yu, Guann-Yi;He, Guobin;Ali, Syed Raza;Holzer, Ryan G;Osterreicher, Christoph H;Takahashi, Hiroyuki;Karin, Michael"

How stored fats are liberated and remodeled to support cancer pathogenesis, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is highly expressed in aggressive human cancer cells and primary tumors, where it regulates a fatty acid network enriched in oncogenic signaling lipids that promotes migration, invasion, survival, and in vivo tumor growth. Overexpression of MAGL in nonaggressive cancer cells recapitulates this fatty acid network and increases their pathogenicity-phenotypes that are reversed by an MAGL inhibitor. Impairments in MAGL-dependent tumor growth are rescued by a high-fat diet, indicating that exogenous sources of fatty acids can contribute to malignancy in cancers lacking MAGL activity.

This results in the expression of point-mutated p53 proteins that have both lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and show gain of functions that contribute to transformation and metastasis. Here, we show that mutant p53 expression can promote invasion, loss of directionality of migration, and metastatic behavior. These activities of p53 reflect enhanced integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, which depends on Rab-coupling protein (RCP) and results in constitutive activation of EGFR/integrin signaling. We provide evidence that mutant p53 promotes cell invasion via the inhibition of TAp63, and simultaneous loss of p53 and TAp63 recapitulates the phenotype of mutant p53 in cells. These findings open the possibility that blocking alpha5/beta1-integrin and/or the EGF receptor will have therapeutic benefit in mutant p53-expressing cancers.","Muller, Patricia A J;Caswell, Patrick T;Doyle, Brendan;Iwanicki, Marcin P;Tan, Ee H;Karim, Saadia;Lukashchuk, Natalia;Gillespie, David A;Ludwig, Robert L;Gosselin, Pauline;Cromer, Anne;Brugge, Joan S;Sansom, Owen J;Norman, Jim C;Vousden, Karen H"
20064377,2009,Cell,Tumor self-seeding by circulating cancer cells.,"Cancer cells that leave the primary tumor can seed metastases in distant organs, and it is thought that this is a unidirectional process. Here we show that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can also colonize their tumors of origin, in a process that we call ""tumor self-seeding."" Self-seeding of breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma tumors in mice is preferentially mediated by aggressive CTCs, including those with bone, lung, or brain-metastatic tropism. We find that the tumor-derived cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 act as CTC attractants whereas MMP1/collagenase-1 and the actin cytoskeleton component fascin-1 are mediators of CTC infiltration into mammary tumors. We show that self-seeding can accelerate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and stromal recruitment through seed-derived factors including the chemokine CXCL1. Tumor self-seeding could explain the relationships between anaplasia, tumor size, vascularity and prognosis, and local recurrence seeded by disseminated cells following ostensibly complete tumor excision.","Kim, Mi-Young;Oskarsson, Thordur;Acharyya, Swarnali;Nguyen, Don X;Zhang, Xiang H-F;Norton, Larry;Massagué, Joan"

By establishing a cellular model that mimics the relative frequency of authentic translocation events without proliferation selection, we report mechanisms of nuclear receptor-dependent tumor translocations. Intronic binding of liganded androgen receptor (AR) first juxtaposes translocation loci by triggering intra- and interchromosomal interactions. AR then promotes site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at translocation loci by recruiting two types of enzymatic activities induced by genotoxic stress and liganded AR, including activation-induced cytidine deaminase and the LINE-1 repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease. These enzymes synergistically generate site-selective DSBs at juxtaposed translocation loci that are ligated by nonhomologous end joining pathway for specific translocations. Our data suggest that the confluence of two parallel pathways initiated by liganded nuclear receptor and genotoxic stress underlies nonrandom tumor translocations, which may function in many types of tumors and pathological processes.","Lin, Chunru;Yang, Liuqing;Tanasa, Bogdan;Hutt, Kasey;Ju, Bong-gun;Ohgi, Kenny;Zhang, Jie;Rose, David W;Fu, Xiang-Dong;Glass, Christopher K;Rosenfeld, Michael G"

EMT endows cells with migratory and invasive properties, induces stem cell properties, prevents apoptosis and senescence, and contributes to immunosuppression. Thus, the mesenchymal state is associated with the capacity of cells to migrate to distant organs and maintain stemness, allowing their subsequent differentiation into multiple cell types during development and the initiation of metastasis.","Thiery, Jean Paul;Acloque, Hervé;Huang, Ruby Y J;Nieto, M Angela"

We found that breast tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen crosslinking, ECM stiffening, and increased focal adhesions. Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibition of integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling, and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reduction of lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy, and lowered tumor incidence. These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue fibrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions, growth factor signaling and breast malignancy.","Levental, Kandice R;Yu, Hongmei;Kass, Laura;Lakins, Johnathon N;Egeblad, Mikala;Erler, Janine T;Fong, Sheri F T;Csiszar, Katalin;Giaccia, Amato;Weninger, Wolfgang;Yamauchi, Mitsuo;Gasser, David L;Weaver, Valerie M"

Direct proof is still lacking, mainly because of our poor understanding of the biological differences between normal and cancer stem cells (SCs). Using the ErbB2 transgenic model of breast cancer, we found that self-renewing divisions of cancer SCs are more frequent than their normal counterparts, unlimited and symmetric, thus contributing to increasing numbers of SCs in tumoral tissues. SCs with targeted mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 possess the same self-renewal properties as cancer SCs, and their number increases progressively in the p53 null premalignant mammary gland. Pharmacological reactivation of p53 correlates with restoration of asymmetric divisions in cancer SCs and tumor growth reduction, without significant effects on additional cancer cells. These data demonstrate that p53 regulates polarity of cell division in mammary SCs and suggest that loss of p53 favors symmetric divisions of cancer SCs, contributing to tumor growth.","Cicalese, Angelo;Bonizzi, Giuseppina;Pasi, Cristina E;Faretta, Mario;Ronzoni, Simona;Giulini, Barbara;Brisken, Cathrin;Minucci, Saverio;Di Fiore, Pier Paolo;Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe"

Here, we report that LSD1 is an integral component of the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Transcriptional target analysis revealed that the LSD1/NuRD complexes regulate several cellular signaling pathways including TGFbeta1 signaling pathway that are critically involved in cell proliferation, survival, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We demonstrated that LSD1 inhibits the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and suppresses breast cancer metastatic potential in vivo. We found that LSD1 is downregulated in breast carcinomas and that its level of expression is negatively correlated with that of TGFbeta1. Our data provide a molecular basis for the interplay of histone demethylation and deacetylation in chromatin remodeling.

One compound, salinomycin, reduces the proportion of CSCs by >100-fold relative to paclitaxel, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug. Treatment of mice with salinomycin inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo and induces increased epithelial differentiation of tumor cells.

We hypothesized that increased CD47 expression on human AML LSC contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting their phagocytosis through the interaction of CD47 with an inhibitory receptor on phagocytes. We found that CD47 was more highly expressed on AML LSC than their normal counterparts, and that increased CD47 expression predicted worse overall survival in three independent cohorts of adult AML patients. Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 preferentially enabled phagocytosis of AML LSC and inhibited their engraftment in vivo. Finally, treatment of human AML LSC-engrafted mice with anti-CD47 antibody depleted AML and targeted AML LSC. In summary, increased CD47 expression is an independent, poor prognostic factor that can be targeted on human AML stem cells with blocking monoclonal antibodies capable of enabling phagocytosis of LSC.","Majeti, Ravindra;Chao, Mark P;Alizadeh, Ash A;Pang, Wendy W;Jaiswal, Siddhartha;Gibbs, Kenneth D;van Rooijen, Nico;Weissman, Irving L"

The androgen receptor (AR) is essential in both, though its function in androgen-independent cancers is poorly understood. We have defined the direct AR-dependent target genes in both androgen-dependent and -independent cancer cells by generating AR-dependent gene expression profiles and AR cistromes. In contrast to what is found in androgen-dependent cells, AR selectively upregulates M-phase cell-cycle genes in androgen-independent cells, including UBE2C, a gene that inactivates the M-phase checkpoint. We find that epigenetic marks at the UBE2C enhancer, notably histone H3K4 methylation and FoxA1 transcription factor binding, are present in androgen-independent cells and direct AR-enhancer binding and UBE2C activation. Thus, the role of AR in androgen-independent cancer cells is not to direct the androgen-dependent gene expression program without androgen, but rather to execute a distinct program resulting in androgen-independent growth.","Wang, Qianben;Li, Wei;Zhang, Yong;Yuan, Xin;Xu, Kexin;Yu, Jindan;Chen, Zhong;Beroukhim, Rameen;Wang, Hongyun;Lupien, Mathieu;Wu, Tao;Regan, Meredith M;Meyer, Clifford A;Carroll, Jason S;Manrai, Arjun Kumar;Jänne, Olli A;Balk, Steven P;Mehra, Rohit;Han, Bo;Chinnaiyan, Arul M;Rubin, Mark A;True, Lawrence;Fiorentino, Michelangelo;Fiore, Christopher;Loda, Massimo;Kantoff, Philip W;Liu, X Shirley;Brown, Myles"

19576624,2009,Cell,WNT/TCF signaling through LEF1 and HOXB9 mediates lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.,"Metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma can occur swiftly to multiple organs within months of diagnosis. The mechanisms that confer this rapid metastatic capacity to lung tumors are unknown. Activation of the canonical WNT/TCF pathway is identified here as a determinant of metastasis to brain and bone during lung adenocarcinoma progression. Gene expression signatures denoting WNT/TCF activation are associated with relapse to multiple organs in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Metastatic subpopulations isolated from independent lymph node-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell lines harbor a hyperactive WNT/TCF pathway. Reduction of TCF activity in these cells attenuates their ability to form brain and bone metastases in mice, independently of effects on tumor growth in the lungs. The WNT/TCF target genes HOXB9 and LEF1 are identified as mediators of chemotactic invasion and colony outgrowth. Thus, a distinct WNT/TCF signaling program through LEF1 and HOXB9 enhances the competence of lung adenocarcinoma cells to colonize the bones and the brain.

Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) mediate RA effects by directly regulating gene expression. To define the genetic network regulated by RARs in breast cancer, we identified RAR genomic targets using chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression analysis. We found that RAR binding throughout the genome is highly coincident with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding, resulting in a widespread crosstalk of RA and estrogen signaling to antagonistically regulate breast cancer-associated genes. ERalpha- and RAR-binding sites appear to be coevolved on a large scale throughout the human genome, often resulting in competitive binding activity at nearby or overlapping cis-regulatory elements. The highly coordinated intersection between these two critical nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways provides a global mechanism for balancing gene expression output via local regulatory interactions dispersed throughout the genome.","Hua, Sujun;Kittler, Ralf;White, Kevin P"

While tumor cells utilize autophagy to survive metabolic stress, autophagy also mitigates the resulting cellular damage that may limit tumorigenesis. In response to stress, autophagy-defective tumor cells preferentially accumulated p62/SQSTM1 (p62), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, damaged mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genome damage. Moreover, suppressing ROS or p62 accumulation prevented damage resulting from autophagy defects indicating that failure to regulate p62 caused oxidative stress. Importantly, sustained p62 expression resulting from autophagy defects was sufficient to alter NF-kappaB regulation and gene expression and to promote tumorigenesis. Thus, defective autophagy is a mechanism for p62 upregulation commonly observed in human tumors that contributes directly to tumorigenesis likely by perturbing the signal transduction adaptor function of p62-controlling pathways critical for oncogenesis.","Mathew, Robin;Karp, Cristina M;Beaudoin, Brian;Vuong, Nhan;Chen, Guanghua;Chen, Hsin-Yi;Bray, Kevin;Reddy, Anupama;Bhanot, Gyan;Gelinas, Celine;Dipaola, Robert S;Karantza-Wadsworth, Vassiliki;White, Eileen"

We found that Cyfip1, a subunit of the WAVE complex, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics, is commonly deleted in human epithelial cancers. Reduced expression of CYFIP1 is commonly observed during invasion of epithelial tumors and is associated with poor prognosis in this setting. Silencing of Cyfip1 disturbed normal epithelial morphogenesis in vitro and cooperated with oncogenic Ras to produce invasive carcinomas in vivo. Mechanistically, we have linked alterations in WAVE-regulated actin dynamics with impaired cell-cell adhesion and cell-ECM interactions. Thus, we propose Cyfip1 as an invasion suppressor gene.","Silva, Jose M;Ezhkova, Elena;Silva, Javier;Heart, Stephen;Castillo, Mireia;Campos, Yolanda;Castro, Veronica;Bonilla, Felix;Cordon-Cardo, Carlos;Muthuswamy, Senthil K;Powers, Scott;Fuchs, Elaine;Hannon, Gregory J"
19524507,2009,Cell,"A pleiotropically acting microRNA, miR-31, inhibits breast cancer metastasis.","MicroRNAs are well suited to regulate tumor metastasis because of their capacity to coordinately repress numerous target genes, thereby potentially enabling their intervention at multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade. We identify a microRNA exemplifying these attributes, miR-31, whose expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-31 in otherwise-aggressive breast tumor cells suppresses metastasis. We deploy a stable microRNA sponge strategy to inhibit miR-31 in vivo; this allows otherwise-nonaggressive breast cancer cells to metastasize. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR-31-mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization. Such pleiotropy is achieved via coordinate repression of a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes, including RhoA. Indeed, RhoA re-expression partially reverses miR-31-imposed metastasis suppression. These findings indicate that miR-31 uses multiple mechanisms to oppose metastasis.","Valastyan, Scott;Reinhardt, Ferenc;Benaich, Nathan;Calogrias, Diana;Szász, Attila M;Wang, Zhigang C;Brock, Jane E;Richardson, Andrea L;Weinberg, Robert A"

Here, we show that retinoblastoma cells express markers of postmitotic cone precursors but not markers of other retinal cell types. We also demonstrate that human cone precursors prominently express MDM2 and N-Myc, that retinoblastoma cells require both of these proteins for proliferation and survival, and that MDM2 is needed to suppress ARF-induced apoptosis in cultured retinoblastoma cells. Interestingly, retinoblastoma cell MDM2 expression was regulated by the cone-specific RXRgamma transcription factor and a human-specific RXRgamma consensus binding site, and proliferation required RXRgamma, as well as the cone-specific thyroid hormone receptor-beta2. These findings provide support for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma and suggest that human cone-specific signaling circuitry sensitizes to the oncogenic effects of RB1 mutations.","Xu, Xiaoliang L;Fang, Yuqiang;Lee, Thomas C;Forrest, Douglas;Gregory-Evans, Cheryl;Almeida, Dena;Liu, Aihong;Jhanwar, Suresh C;Abramson, David H;Cobrinik, David"

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a miRNA replacement therapy for liver cancer. We demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit reduced expression of miR-26a, a miRNA that is normally expressed at high levels in diverse tissues. Expression of this miRNA in liver cancer cells in vitro induces cell-cycle arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclins D2 and E2. Systemic administration of this miRNA in a mouse model of HCC using adeno-associated virus (AAV) results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic protection from disease progression without toxicity.

We undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the KRAS oncogene. We discovered a diverse set of proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and the proteasome that, when inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature.

We used high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) to identify synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS, the most commonly mutated human oncogene. We find that cells that are dependent on mutant KRAS exhibit sensitivity to suppression of the serine/threonine kinase STK33 irrespective of tissue origin, whereas STK33 is not required by KRAS-independent cells. STK33 promotes cancer cell viability in a kinase activity-dependent manner by regulating the suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis mediated through S6K1-induced inactivation of the death agonist BAD selectively in mutant KRAS-dependent cells.

Using zebrafish and human cells, we show that homozygous loss of APC causes failed intestinal cell differentiation but that this occurs in the absence of nuclear beta-catenin and increased intestinal cell proliferation. Therefore, loss of APC is insufficient for causing beta-catenin nuclear localization. APC mutation-induced intestinal differentiation defects instead depend on the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein-1 (CtBP1), whereas proliferation defects and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin require the additional activation of KRAS. These findings suggest that, following APC loss, CtBP1 contributes to adenoma initiation as a first step, whereas KRAS activation and beta-catenin nuclear localization promote adenoma progression to carcinomas as a second step. Consistent with this model, human FAP adenomas showed robust upregulation of CtBP1 in the absence of detectable nuclear beta-catenin, whereas nuclear beta-catenin was detected in carcinomas.","Phelps, Reid A;Chidester, Stephanie;Dehghanizadeh, Somaye;Phelps, Jason;Sandoval, Imelda T;Rai, Kunal;Broadbent, Talmage;Sarkar, Sharmistha;Burt, Randall W;Jones, David A"
19446321,2009,Cell,DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.,"The mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival. We identify DEPTOR as an mTOR-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. Loss of DEPTOR activates S6K1, Akt, and SGK1, promotes cell growth and survival, and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities. DEPTOR overexpression suppresses S6K1 but, by relieving feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K signaling, activates Akt. Consistent with many human cancers having activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways, DEPTOR expression is low in most cancers. Surprisingly, DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in a subset of multiple myelomas harboring cyclin D1/D3 or c-MAF/MAFB translocations. In these cells, high DEPTOR expression is necessary to maintain PI3K and Akt activation and a reduction in DEPTOR levels leads to apoptosis. Thus, we identify a novel mTOR-interacting protein whose deregulated overexpression in multiple myeloma cells represents a mechanism for activating PI3K/Akt signaling and promoting cell survival.","Peterson, Timothy R;Laplante, Mathieu;Thoreen, Carson C;Sancak, Yasemin;Kang, Seong A;Kuehl, W Michael;Gray, Nathanael S;Sabatini, David M"

This burgeoning range of responses to p53 is reflected by an increasing variety of mechanisms through which p53 can function, although the ability to activate transcription remains key to p53's modus operandi. Control of p53's transcriptional activity is crucial for determining which p53 response is activated, a decision we must understand if we are to exploit efficiently the next generation of drugs that selectively activate or inhibit p53.","Vousden, Karen H;Prives, Carol"

19345189,2009,Cell,A Mutant-p53/Smad complex opposes p63 to empower TGFbeta-induced metastasis.,"TGFbeta ligands act as tumor suppressors in early stage tumors but are paradoxically diverted into potent prometastatic factors in advanced cancers. The molecular nature of this switch remains enigmatic. Here, we show that TGFbeta-dependent cell migration, invasion and metastasis are empowered by mutant-p53 and opposed by p63. Mechanistically, TGFbeta acts in concert with oncogenic Ras and mutant-p53 to induce the assembly of a mutant-p53/p63 protein complex in which Smads serve as essential platforms. Within this ternary complex, p63 functions are antagonized. Downstream of p63, we identified two candidate metastasis suppressor genes associated with metastasis risk in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. Thus, two common oncogenic lesions, mutant-p53 and Ras, selected in early neoplasms to promote growth and survival, also prefigure a cellular set-up with particular metastasis proclivity by TGFbeta-dependent inhibition of p63 function.","Adorno, Maddalena;Cordenonsi, Michelangelo;Montagner, Marco;Dupont, Sirio;Wong, Christine;Hann, Byron;Solari, Aldo;Bobisse, Sara;Rondina, Maria Beatrice;Guzzardo, Vincenza;Parenti, Anna R;Rosato, Antonio;Bicciato, Silvio;Balmain, Allan;Piccolo, Stefano"

We describe a conceptual framework of how oncogene and non-oncogene addictions contribute to these hallmarks and how they can be exploited through stress sensitization and stress overload to selectively kill cancer cells. In particular, we present evidence for a large class of non-oncogenes that are essential for cancer cell survival and present attractive drug targets.

19217150,2009,Cell,Heterozygous deficiency of PHD2 restores tumor oxygenation and inhibits metastasis via endothelial normalization.,"A key function of blood vessels, to supply oxygen, is impaired in tumors because of abnormalities in their endothelial lining. PHD proteins serve as oxygen sensors and may regulate oxygen delivery. We therefore studied the role of endothelial PHD2 in vessel shaping by implanting tumors in PHD2(+/-) mice. Haplodeficiency of PHD2 did not affect tumor vessel density or lumen size, but normalized the endothelial lining and vessel maturation. This resulted in improved tumor perfusion and oxygenation and inhibited tumor cell invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. Haplodeficiency of PHD2 redirected the specification of endothelial tip cells to a more quiescent cell type, lacking filopodia and arrayed in a phalanx formation. This transition relied on HIF-driven upregulation of (soluble) VEGFR-1 and VE-cadherin. Thus, decreased activity of an oxygen sensor in hypoxic conditions prompts endothelial cells to readjust their shape and phenotype to restore oxygen supply. Inhibition of PHD2 may offer alternative therapeutic opportunities for anticancer therapy.","Mazzone, Massimiliano;Dettori, Daniela;de Oliveira, Rodrigo Leite;Loges, Sonja;Schmidt, Thomas;Jonckx, Bart;Tian, Ya-Min;Lanahan, Anthony A;Pollard, Patrick;de Almodovar, Carmen Ruiz;De Smet, Frederik;Vinckier, Stefan;Aragonés, Julián;Debackere, Koen;Luttun, Aernout;Wyns, Sabine;Jordan, Benedicte;Pisacane, Alberto;Gallez, Bernard;Lampugnani, Maria Grazia;Dejana, Elisabetta;Simons, Michael;Ratcliffe, Peter;Maxwell, Patrick;Carmeliet, Peter"
19203586,2009,Cell,PH domain-only protein PHLDA3 is a p53-regulated repressor of Akt.,"p53 And Akt are critical players regulating tumorigenesis with opposite effects: whereas p53 transactivates target genes to exert its function as a tumor suppressor, Akt phosphorylates its substrates and transduces downstream survival signals. In addition, p53 and Akt negatively regulate each other to balance survival and death signals within a cell. We now identify PHLDA3 as a p53 target gene that encodes a PH domain-only protein. We find that PHLDA3 competes with the PH domain of Akt for binding of membrane lipids, thereby inhibiting Akt translocation to the cellular membrane and activation. Ablation of endogenous PHLDA3 results in enhanced Akt activity and decrease of p53-dependent apoptosis. We also demonstrate the suppression of anchorage-independent cell growth by PHLDA3. Loss of the PHLDA3 genomic locus was frequently observed in primary lung cancers, suggesting a role of PHLDA3 in tumor suppression. Our results reveal a new mode of coordination between the p53 and Akt pathways.","Kawase, Tatsuya;Ohki, Rieko;Shibata, Tatsuhiro;Tsutsumi, Shuichi;Kamimura, Naoko;Inazawa, Johji;Ohta, Tsutomu;Ichikawa, Hitoshi;Aburatani, Hiroyuki;Tashiro, Fumio;Taya, Yoichi"

Using this database, we show that although the CpG dinucleotide constitutes only 1% of the human genome, it accounts for 40%-70% of breakpoints at pro-B/pre-B stage translocation regions-specifically, those near the bcl-2, bcl-1, and E2A genes. We do not observe CpG hotspots in rearrangements involving lymphoid-myeloid progenitors, mature B cells, or T cells. The stage specificity, lineage specificity, CpG targeting, and unique breakpoint distributions at these cluster regions may be explained by a lesion-specific double-strand breakage mechanism involving the RAG complex acting at AID-deaminated methyl-CpGs.","Tsai, Albert G;Lu, Haihui;Raghavan, Sathees C;Muschen, Markus;Hsieh, Chih-Lin;Lieber, Michael R"
19041750,2008,Cell,Deregulation of scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and reveals a role for cell polarity in carcinoma.,"Loss of cell polarity proteins such as Scribble induces neoplasia in Drosophila by promoting uncontrolled proliferation. In mammals, the role that polarity proteins play during tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Scribble in mammary epithelia disrupts cell polarity, blocks three-dimensional morphogenesis, inhibits apoptosis, and induces dysplasia in vivo that progress to tumors after long latency. Loss of Scribble cooperates with oncogenes such as c-myc to transform epithelial cells and induce tumors in vivo by blocking activation of an apoptosis pathway. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble from cell-cell junction was sufficient to promote cell transformation. Interestingly, spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans possess both downregulated and mislocalized Scribble. Thus, we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death.","Zhan, Lixing;Rosenberg, Avi;Bergami, Kenneth C;Yu, Min;Xuan, Zhenyu;Jaffe, Aron B;Allred, Craig;Muthuswamy, Senthil K"

However, the role of telomerase in organismal aging has remained unaddressed, in part because of the cancer-promoting activity of telomerase. To circumvent this problem, we have constitutively expressed telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), one of the components of telomerase, in mice engineered to be cancer resistant by means of enhanced expression of the tumor suppressors p53, p16, and p19ARF. In this context, TERT overexpression improves the fitness of epithelial barriers, particularly the skin and the intestine, and produces a systemic delay in aging accompanied by extension of the median life span. These results demonstrate that constitutive expression of Tert provides antiaging activity in the context of a mammalian organism.","Tomás-Loba, Antonia;Flores, Ignacio;Fernández-Marcos, Pablo J;Cayuela, María L;Maraver, Antonio;Tejera, Agueda;Borrás, Consuelo;Matheu, Ander;Klatt, Peter;Flores, Juana M;Viña, José;Serrano, Manuel;Blasco, Maria A"

To functionally identify tumor suppressor genes relevant to human cancer, we compiled pools of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the mouse orthologs of genes recurrently deleted in a series of human hepatocellular carcinomas and tested their ability to promote tumorigenesis in a mosaic mouse model. In contrast to randomly selected shRNA pools, many deletion-specific pools accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Through further analysis, we identified and validated 13 tumor suppressor genes, 12 of which had not been linked to cancer before. One gene, XPO4, encodes a nuclear export protein whose substrate, EIF5A2, is amplified in human tumors, is required for proliferation of XPO4-deficient tumor cells, and promotes hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.

18984162,2008,Cell,Rac activation and inactivation control plasticity of tumor cell movement.,"Tumor cells exhibit two different modes of individual cell movement. Mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular morphology and requires extracellular proteolysis. In amoeboid movement, cells have a rounded morphology, are less dependent on proteases, and require high Rho-kinase signaling to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes of cell movement are interconvertible. We show that mesenchymal-type movement in melanoma cells is driven by activation of the GTPase Rac through a complex containing NEDD9, a recently identified melanoma metastasis gene, and DOCK3, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rac signals through WAVE2 to direct mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement through decreasing actomyosin contractility. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho-kinase signaling activates a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, that suppresses mesenchymal movement by inactivating Rac. We demonstrate tight interplay between Rho and Rac in determining different modes of tumor cell movement, revealing how tumor cells switch between different modes of movement.","Sanz-Moreno, Victoria;Gadea, Gilles;Ahn, Jessica;Paterson, Hugh;Marra, Pierfrancesco;Pinner, Sophie;Sahai, Erik;Marshall, Christopher J"

Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas. Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1 deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in Nf1+/- hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression.

Yet, paradoxically, TGFbeta also modulates processes such as cell invasion, immune regulation, and microenvironment modification that cancer cells may exploit to their advantage. Consequently, the output of a TGFbeta response is highly contextual throughout development, across different tissues, and also in cancer.

18555776,2008,Cell,Systemic endocrine instigation of indolent tumor growth requires osteopontin.,"The effects of primary tumors on the host systemic environment and resulting contributions of the host to tumor growth are poorly understood. Here, we find that human breast carcinomas instigate the growth of otherwise-indolent tumor cells, micrometastases, and human tumor surgical specimens located at distant anatomical sites. This systemic instigation is accompanied by incorporation of bone-marrow cells (BMCs) into the stroma of the distant, once-indolent tumors. We find that BMCs of hosts bearing instigating tumors are functionally activated prior to their mobilization; hence, when coinjected with indolent cells, these activated BMCs mimic the systemic effects imparted by instigating tumors. Secretion of osteopontin by instigating tumors is necessary for BMC activation and the subsequent outgrowth of the distant otherwise-indolent tumors. These results reveal that outgrowth of indolent tumors can be governed on a systemic level by endocrine factors released by certain instigating tumors, and hold important experimental and therapeutic implications.","McAllister, Sandra S;Gifford, Ann M;Greiner, Ashley L;Kelleher, Stephen P;Saelzler, Matthew P;Ince, Tan A;Reinhardt, Ferenc;Harris, Lyndsay N;Hylander, Bonnie L;Repasky, Elizabeth A;Weinberg, Robert A"

However, whether deregulated pol III transcription contributes to transformation has been unclear. Generating cell lines expressing an inducible pol III-specific transcription factor, Brf1, allowed us to raise tRNA and 5S rRNA levels specifically. Brf1 induction caused an increase in cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation, whereas depletion of Brf1 impeded transformation. Among the gene products induced by Brf1 is the tRNA(iMet) that initiates polypeptide synthesis. Overexpression of tRNA(iMet) is sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation and allow immortalized fibroblasts to form foci in culture and tumors in mice. The data indicate that elevated tRNA synthesis can promote cellular transformation.","Marshall, Lynne;Kenneth, Niall S;White, Robert J"
18394990,2008,Cell,TGFbeta primes breast tumors for lung metastasis seeding through angiopoietin-like 4.,"Cells released from primary tumors seed metastases to specific organs by a nonrandom process, implying the involvement of biologically selective mechanisms. Based on clinical, functional, and molecular evidence, we show that the cytokine TGFbeta in the breast tumor microenvironment primes cancer cells for metastasis to the lungs. Central to this process is the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) by TGFbeta via the Smad signaling pathway. TGFbeta induction of Angptl4 in cancer cells that are about to enter the circulation enhances their subsequent retention in the lungs, but not in the bone. Tumor cell-derived Angptl4 disrupts vascular endothelial cell-cell junctions, increases the permeability of lung capillaries, and facilitates the trans-endothelial passage of tumor cells. These results suggest a mechanism for metastasis whereby a cytokine in the primary tumor microenvironment induces the expression of another cytokine in departing tumor cells, empowering these cells to disrupt lung capillary walls and seed pulmonary metastases.","Padua, David;Zhang, Xiang H-F;Wang, Qiongqing;Nadal, Cristina;Gerald, William L;Gomis, Roger R;Massagué, Joan"

Because miRNAs can regulate cell-fate decisions, we compared miRNA expression in self-renewing and differentiated cells from breast cancer lines and in breast T-IC (BT-IC) and non-BT-IC from 1 degrees breast cancers. let-7 miRNAs were markedly reduced in BT-IC and increased with differentiation. Infecting BT-IC with let-7-lentivirus reduced proliferation, mammosphere formation, and the proportion of undifferentiated cells in vitro and tumor formation and metastasis in NOD/SCID mice, while antagonizing let-7 by antisense oligonucleotides enhanced in vitro self renewal of non-T-IC. Increased let-7 paralleled reduced H-RAS and HMGA2, known let-7 targets. Silencing H-RAS in a BT-IC-enriched cell line reduced self renewal but had no effect on differentiation, while silencing HMGA2 enhanced differentiation but did not affect self renewal. Therefore let-7 regulates multiple BT-IC stem cell-like properties by silencing more than one target.","Yu, Fengyan;Yao, Herui;Zhu, Pengcheng;Zhang, Xiaoqin;Pan, Qiuhui;Gong, Chang;Huang, Yijun;Hu, Xiaoqu;Su, Fengxi;Lieberman, Judy;Song, Erwei"

Rb and p130 are redundantly expressed in the neurons of the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina.

We report that eliminating HSF1 protects mice from tumors induced by mutations of the RAS oncogene or a hot spot mutation in the tumor suppressor p53. In cell culture, HSF1 supports malignant transformation by orchestrating a network of core cellular functions including proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, and glucose metabolism. The striking effects of HSF1 on oncogenic transformation are not limited to mouse systems or tumor initiation; human cancer lines of diverse origins show much greater dependence on HSF1 function to maintain proliferation and survival than their nontransformed counterparts. While it enhances organismal survival and longevity under most circumstances, HSF1 has the opposite effect in supporting the lethal phenomenon of cancer.","Dai, Chengkai;Whitesell, Luke;Rogers, Arlin B;Lindquist, Susan"

17632056,2007,Cell,CIP2A inhibits PP2A in human malignancies.,"Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity has been identified as a prerequisite for the transformation of human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PP2A activity is inhibited in human cancers are currently unclear. In this study, we describe a cellular inhibitor of PP2A with oncogenic activity. The protein, designated Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), interacts directly with the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, inhibits PP2A activity toward c-Myc serine 62 (S62), and thereby prevents c-Myc proteolytic degradation. In addition to its function in c-Myc stabilization, CIP2A promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. The oncogenic activity of CIP2A is demonstrated by transformation of human cells by overexpression of CIP2A. Importantly, CIP2A is overexpressed in two common human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colon cancer. Thus, our data show that CIP2A is a human oncoprotein that inhibits PP2A and stabilizes c-Myc in human malignancies.","Junttila, Melissa R;Puustinen, Pietri;Niemelä, Minna;Ahola, Raija;Arnold, Hugh;Böttzauw, Trine;Ala-aho, Risto;Nielsen, Christina;Ivaska, Johanna;Taya, Yoichi;Lu, Shi-Long;Lin, Shujun;Chan, Edward K L;Wang, Xiao-Jing;Grènman, Reidar;Kast, Juergen;Kallunki, Tuula;Sears, Rosalie;Kähäri, Veli-Matti;Westermarck, Jukka"

Here we integrate complementary genomic approaches to identify human oncogenes. We show that activation of the ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways cooperate to transform human cells. Using a library of activated kinases, we identify several kinases that replace PI3K signaling and render cells tumorigenic. Whole genome structural analyses reveal that one of these kinases, IKBKE (IKKepsilon), is amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumors. Suppression of IKKepsilon expression in breast cancer cell lines that harbor IKBKE amplifications induces cell death. IKKepsilon activates the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in both cell lines and breast cancers. These observations suggest a mechanism for NF-kappaB activation in breast cancer, implicate the NF-kappaB pathway as a downstream mediator of PI3K, and provide a framework for integrated genomic approaches in oncogene discovery.","Boehm, Jesse S;Zhao, Jean J;Yao, Jun;Kim, So Young;Firestein, Ron;Dunn, Ian F;Sjostrom, Sarah K;Garraway, Levi A;Weremowicz, Stanislawa;Richardson, Andrea L;Greulich, Heidi;Stewart, Carly J;Mulvey, Laura A;Shen, Rhine R;Ambrogio, Lauren;Hirozane-Kishikawa, Tomoko;Hill, David E;Vidal, Marc;Meyerson, Matthew;Grenier, Jennifer K;Hinkle, Greg;Root, David E;Roberts, Thomas M;Lander, Eric S;Polyak, Kornelia;Hahn, William C"

Although the ability of Ras to control PI 3-kinase has been well established in manipulated cell culture models, evidence for a role of the interaction of endogenous Ras with PI 3-kinase in normal and malignant cell growth in vivo has been lacking. Here we generate mice with mutations in the Pi3kca gene encoding the catalytic p110alpha isoform that block its interaction with Ras. Cells from these mice show proliferative defects and selective disruption of signaling from growth factors to PI 3-kinase. The mice display defective development of the lymphatic vasculature, resulting in perinatal appearance of chylous ascites. Most importantly, they are highly resistant to endogenous Ras oncogene-induced tumorigenesis.

We show that loss or reduced expression of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) underlies cases of heritable predisposition to CLL and the majority of sporadic CLL. Epigenetic silencing of DAPK1 by promoter methylation occurs in almost all sporadic CLL cases. Furthermore, we defined a disease haplotype, which segregates with the CLL phenotype in a large family. DAPK1 expression of the CLL allele is downregulated by 75% in germline cells due to increased HOXB7 binding. In the blood cells from affected family members, promoter methylation results in additional loss of DAPK1 expression.

17512406,2007,Cell,Opposing effects of retinoic acid on cell growth result from alternate activation of two different nuclear receptors.,"Transcriptional activation of the nuclear receptor RAR by retinoic acid (RA) often leads to inhibition of cell growth. However, in some tissues, RA promotes cell survival and hyperplasia, activities that are unlikely to be mediated by RAR. Here, we show that, in addition to functioning through RAR, RA activates the ""orphan"" nuclear receptor PPARbeta/delta, which, in turn, induces the expression of prosurvival genes. Partitioning of RA between the two receptors is regulated by the intracellular lipid binding proteins CRABP-II and FABP5. These proteins specifically deliver RA from the cytosol to nuclear RAR and PPARbeta/delta, respectively, thereby selectively enhancing the transcriptional activity of their cognate receptors. Consequently, RA functions through RAR and is a proapoptotic agent in cells with high CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio, but it signals through PPARbeta/delta and promotes survival in cells that highly express FABP5. Opposing effects of RA on cell growth thus emanate from alternate activation of two different nuclear receptors.","Schug, Thaddeus T;Berry, Daniel C;Shaw, Natacha S;Travis, Skylar N;Noy, Noa"

While germline or somatic deletion of up to five FoxO alleles produced remarkably modest neoplastic phenotypes, broad somatic deletion of all FoxOs engendered a progressive cancer-prone condition characterized by thymic lymphomas and hemangiomas, demonstrating that the mammalian FoxOs are indeed bona fide tumor suppressors. Transcriptome and promoter analyses of differentially affected endothelium identified direct FoxO targets and revealed that FoxO regulation of these targets in vivo is highly context-specific, even in the same cell type.

However, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways mediating the senescence response. p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) is a p38 MAPK substrate whose physiological functions are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for PRAK in tumor suppression by demonstrating that PRAK mediates senescence upon activation by p38 in response to oncogenic ras. PRAK deficiency in mice enhances DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis, coinciding with compromised senescence induction. In primary cells, inactivation of PRAK prevents senescence and promotes oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, we show that PRAK activates p53 by direct phosphorylation. We propose that phosphorylation of p53 by PRAK following activation of p38 MAPK by ras plays an important role in ras-induced senescence and tumor suppression.","Sun, Peiqing;Yoshizuka, Naoto;New, Liguo;Moser, Bettina A;Li, Yilei;Liao, Rong;Xie, Changchuan;Chen, Jianming;Deng, Qingdong;Yamout, Maria;Dong, Meng-Qiu;Frangou, Costas G;Yates, John R;Wright, Peter E;Han, Jiahuai"

Here, we present data indicating that the oncogenic kinase Src regulates p27 stability through phosphorylation of p27 at tyrosine 74 and tyrosine 88. Src inhibitors increase cellular p27 stability, and Src overexpression accelerates p27 proteolysis. Src-phosphorylated p27 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 poorly in vitro, and Src transfection reduces p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. Our data indicate that phosphorylation by Src impairs the Cdk2 inhibitory action of p27 and reduces its steady-state binding to cyclin E-Cdk2 to facilitate cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 proteolysis. Furthermore, we find that Src-activated breast cancer lines show reduced p27 and observe a correlation between Src activation and reduced nuclear p27 in 482 primary human breast cancers. Importantly, we report that in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines, Src inhibition can increase p27 levels and restore tamoxifen sensitivity. These data provide a new rationale for Src inhibitors in cancer therapy.","Chu, Isabel;Sun, Jun;Arnaout, Angel;Kahn, Harriette;Hanna, Wedad;Narod, Steven;Sun, Ping;Tan, Cheng-Keat;Hengst, Ludger;Slingerland, Joyce"
17254966,2007,Cell,Cdk-inhibitory activity and stability of p27Kip1 are directly regulated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases.,"p27Kip1 controls cell proliferation by binding to and regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we show that Cdk inhibition and p27 stability are regulated through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. A conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of p27 can be phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn and the oncogene product BCR-ABL. Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent p27 binding to cyclin A/Cdk2. Instead, it causes phosphorylated Y88 and the entire inhibitory 3(10)-helix of p27 to be ejected from the Cdk2 active site, thus restoring partial Cdk activity. Importantly, this allows Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently phosphorylated on threonine 187 by Cdk2 which in turn promotes its SCF-Skp2-dependent degradation. This direct link between transforming tyrosine kinases and p27 may provide an explanation for Cdk kinase activities observed in p27 complexes and for premature p27 elimination in cells that have been transformed by activated tyrosine kinases.","Grimmler, Matthias;Wang, Yuefeng;Mund, Thomas;Cilensek, Zoran;Keidel, Eva-Maria;Waddell, M Brett;Jäkel, Heidelinde;Kullmann, Michael;Kriwacki, Richard W;Hengst, Ludger"

This complex is regulated by the 4E-BPs, which compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E and which have tumor-suppressor activity. To pharmacologically mimic 4E-BP function we developed a high-throughput screening assay for identifying small-molecule inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. The most potent compound identified, 4EGI-1, binds eIF4E, disrupts eIF4E/eIF4G association, and inhibits cap-dependent translation but not initiation factor-independent translation. While 4EGI-1 displaces eIF4G from eIF4E, it effectively enhances 4E-BP1 association both in vitro and in cells. 4EGI-1 inhibits cellular expression of oncogenic proteins encoded by weak mRNAs, exhibits activity against multiple cancer cell lines, and appears to have a preferential effect on transformed versus nontransformed cells.

To explore the efficacy of p53 reinstatement as a tumor therapy, we used a reversibly switchable p53 knockin (KI) mouse model that permits modulation of p53 status from wild-type to knockout, at will. Using the well-characterized Emu-myc lymphoma model, we show that p53 is spontaneously activated when restored in established Emu-myc lymphomas in vivo, triggering rapid apoptosis and conferring a significant increase in survival. Nonetheless, reimposition of p53 function potently selects for emergence of p53-resistant tumors through inactivation of p19(ARF) or p53. Our study provides important insights into the nature and timing of p53-activating signals in established tumors and how resistance to p53 evolves, which will aid in the optimization of p53-based tumor therapies.","Martins, Carla P;Brown-Swigart, Lamorna;Evan, Gerard I"

We present a multiscale mathematical model of cancer invasion, which considers cellular and microenvironmental factors simultaneously and interactively. Unexpectedly, the model simulations predict that harsh tumor microenvironment conditions (e.g., hypoxia, heterogenous extracellular matrix) exert a dramatic selective force on the tumor, which grows as an invasive mass with fingering margins, dominated by a few clones with aggressive traits. In contrast, mild microenvironment conditions (e.g., normoxia, homogeneous matrix) allow clones with similar aggressive traits to coexist with less aggressive phenotypes in a heterogeneous tumor mass with smooth, noninvasive margins. Thus, the genetic make-up of a cancer cell may realize its invasive potential through a clonal evolution process driven by definable microenvironmental selective forces.

Specifically, RalB is required to suppress apoptotic checkpoint activation, the mechanistic basis of which is unknown. Reported effector proteins of RalB include the Sec5 component of the exocyst, an octameric protein complex implicated in tethering of vesicles to membranes. Surprisingly, we find that the RalB/Sec5 effector complex directly recruits and activates the atypical IkappaB kinase family member TBK1. In cancer cells, constitutive engagement of this pathway, via chronic RalB activation, restricts initiation of apoptotic programs typically engaged in the context of oncogenic stress. Although dispensable for survival in a nontumorigenic context, this pathway helps mount an innate immune response to virus exposure.

16901784,2006,Cell,A novel role for high-mobility group a proteins in cellular senescence and heterochromatin formation.,"Cellular senescence is a stable state of proliferative arrest that provides a barrier to malignant transformation and contributes to the antitumor activity of certain chemotherapies. Senescent cells can accumulate senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may provide a chromatin buffer that prevents activation of proliferation-associated genes by mitogenic transcription factors. Surprisingly, we show that the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins, which can promote tumorigenesis, accumulate on the chromatin of senescent fibroblasts and are essential structural components of SAHFs. HMGA proteins cooperate with the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor to promote SAHF formation and proliferative arrest and stabilize senescence by contributing to the repression of proliferation-associated genes. These antiproliferative activities are canceled by coexpression of the HDM2 and CDK4 oncogenes, which are often coamplified with HMGA2 in human cancers. Our results identify a component of the senescence machinery that contributes to heterochromatin formation and imply that HMGA proteins also act in tumor suppressor networks.","Narita, Masashi;Narita, Masako;Krizhanovsky, Valery;Nuñez, Sabrina;Chicas, Agustin;Hearn, Stephen A;Myers, Michael P;Lowe, Scott W"
16901783,2006,Cell,Beta 4 integrin amplifies ErbB2 signaling to promote mammary tumorigenesis.,"Amplification of the ErbB2 locus, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, is common in aggressive breast tumors and correlates with poor prognosis. The mechanisms underlying ErbB2-mediated breast carcinoma progression remain incompletely defined. To examine the role of the signaling and cell-adhesion receptor beta 4 integrin during ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis, we introduced a targeted deletion of the beta 4 signaling domain into a mouse model of ErbB2-induced mammary carcinoma. Loss of beta 4 signaling suppresses mammary tumor onset and invasive growth. Ex vivo studies indicate that beta 4 forms a complex with ErbB2 and enhances activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun. STAT3 contributes to disruption of epithelial adhesion and polarity, while c-Jun is required for hyperproliferation. Finally, deletion of the beta 4 signaling domain enhances the efficacy of ErbB2-targeted therapy. These results indicate that beta 4 integrin promotes tumor progression by amplifying ErbB2 signaling and identify beta 4 as a potential target for molecular therapy of breast cancer.","Guo, Wenjun;Pylayeva, Yuliya;Pepe, Angela;Yoshioka, Toshiaki;Muller, William J;Inghirami, Giorgio;Giancotti, Filippo G"

In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its host. Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into two subclades.

We have identified a p53-inducible gene named TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator). TIGAR expression lowered fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels in cells, resulting in an inhibition of glycolysis and an overall decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These functions of TIGAR correlated with an ability to protect cells from ROS-associated apoptosis, and consequently, knockdown of endogenous TIGAR expression sensitized cells to p53-induced death. Expression of TIGAR may therefore modulate the apoptotic response to p53, allowing survival in the face of mild or transient stress signals that may be reversed or repaired. The decrease of intracellular ROS levels in response to TIGAR may also play a role in the ability of p53 to protect from the accumulation of genomic damage.","Bensaad, Karim;Tsuruta, Atsushi;Selak, Mary A;Vidal, M Nieves Calvo;Nakano, Katsunori;Bartrons, Ramon;Gottlieb, Eyal;Vousden, Karen H"

Further analyses identified Nedd9, an adaptor protein related to p130CAS, as the only gene within the minimal common region that exhibited amplification-associated overexpression. A series of functional, biochemical, and clinical studies established NEDD9 as a bona fide melanoma metastasis gene. NEDD9 enhanced invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo of both normal and transformed melanocytes, functionally interacted with focal adhesion kinase and modulated focal contact formation, and exhibited frequent robust overexpression in human metastatic melanoma relative to primary melanoma.

Genome-wide analyses of tumors in this mouse model and in human hepatocellular carcinomas revealed a recurrent amplification at mouse chromosome 9qA1, the syntenic region of human chromosome 11q22. Gene-expression analyses delineated cIAP1, a known inhibitor of apoptosis, and Yap, a transcription factor, as candidate oncogenes in the amplicon. In the genetic context of their amplification, both cIAP1 and Yap accelerated tumorigenesis and were required to sustain rapid growth of amplicon-containing tumors.

16713561,2006,Cell,Cyld inhibits tumor cell proliferation by blocking Bcl-3-dependent NF-kappaB signaling.,"Mutations in the CYLD gene cause tumors of hair-follicle keratinocytes. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinase that removes lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF2 and inhibits p65/p50 NF-kappaB activation. Here we show that mice lacking Cyld are highly susceptible to chemically induced skin tumors. Cyld-/- tumors and keratinocytes treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) or UV light are hyperproliferative and have elevated cyclin D1 levels. The cyclin D1 elevation is caused not by increased p65/p50 action but rather by increased nuclear activity of Bcl-3-associated NF-kappaB p50 and p52. In Cyld+/+ keratinocytes, TPA or UV light triggers the translocation of Cyld from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region, where Cyld binds and deubiquitinates Bcl-3, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of Bcl-3 and p50/Bcl-3- or p52/Bcl-3-dependent proliferation. These data indicate that, depending on the external signals, Cyld can negatively regulate different NF-kappaB pathways; inactivation of TRAF2 controls survival and inflammation, while inhibition of Bcl-3 controls proliferation and tumor growth.","Massoumi, Ramin;Chmielarska, Katarzyna;Hennecke, Katharina;Pfeifer, Alexander;Fässler, Reinhard"

Many eukaryotic viruses serve for transgene delivery but require elimination of native tropism for mammalian cells; in contrast, prokaryotic viruses can be adapted to bind to mammalian receptors but are otherwise poor vehicles. Here we introduce a system containing cis-elements from adeno-associated virus (AAV) and single-stranded bacteriophage. Our AAV/phage (AAVP) prototype targets an integrin. We show that AAVP provides superior tumor transduction over phage and that incorporation of inverted terminal repeats is associated with improved fate of the delivered transgene. Moreover, we show that the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of gene expression mediated by targeted AAVP can be monitored by positron emission tomography. This new class of targeted hybrid viral particles will enable a wide range of applications in biology and medicine.","Hajitou, Amin;Trepel, Martin;Lilley, Caroline E;Soghomonyan, Suren;Alauddin, Mian M;Marini, Frank C;Restel, Bradley H;Ozawa, Michael G;Moya, Catherine A;Rangel, Roberto;Sun, Yan;Zaoui, Karim;Schmidt, Manfred;von Kalle, Christof;Weitzman, Matthew D;Gelovani, Juri G;Pasqualini, Renata;Arap, Wadih"

Here, we show that Drosophila larval neuroblasts-stem cell-like precursors of the adult brain-regulate proliferation by segregating the growth inhibitor Brat and the transcription factor Prospero into only one daughter cell. Like Prospero, Brat binds and cosegregates with the adaptor protein Miranda. In larval neuroblasts, both Brat and Prospero are required to inhibit self-renewal in one of the two daughter cells. While Prospero regulates cell-cycle gene transcription, Brat acts as a posttranscriptional inhibitor of dMyc. In brat or prospero mutants, both daughter cells grow and behave like neuroblasts leading to the formation of larval brain tumors. Similar defects are seen in lethal giant larvae (lgl) mutants where Brat and Prospero are not asymmetric. We have identified a molecular mechanism that may control self-renewal and prevent tumor formation in other stem cells as well.","Betschinger, Joerg;Mechtler, Karl;Knoblich, Juergen A"

To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2.

Better understanding of microbial pattern-recognition receptors and innate immune signaling pathways of the host is helping to elucidate the connection between microbial infection and chronic disease. We propose that a key aspect of pathogenesis is an aberrant epithelial barrier that can be instigated by microbial toxins, environmental insults, or the genetic predisposition of the host. Loss of epithelial integrity results in activation of resident inflammatory cells by microbial invaders or endogenous ligands. When coupled with a failure of normal control mechanisms that limit leukocyte activation, a cascade is established that induces chronic inflammation and its consequences. Here, we outline this mechanistic framework and briefly review how alteration of innate immune response genes in murine models can provide insights into the potential microbial origins of diverse conditions including Crohn's disease, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and liver cancer.","Karin, Michael;Lawrence, Toby;Nizet, Victor"

Here we report specific prostate cancer cell/macrophage interactions that mediate a switch in function of selective androgen receptor antagonists/modulators (SARMs) from repression to activation in vivo. This is based on an evolutionarily conserved receptor N-terminal L/HX7LL motif, selectively present in sex steroid receptors, that causes recruitment of TAB2 as a component of an N-CoR corepressor complex. TAB2 acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals by serving as a molecular beacon for recruitment of MEKK1, which in turn mediates dismissal of the N-CoR/HDAC complex and permits derepression of androgen and estrogen receptor target genes. Surprisingly, this conserved sensor strategy may have arisen to mediate reversal of sex steroid-dependent repression of a limited cohort of target genes in response to inflammatory signals, linking inflammatory and nuclear receptor ligand responses to essential reproductive functions.","Zhu, Ping;Baek, Sung Hee;Bourk, Eliot M;Ohgi, Kenneth A;Garcia-Bassets, Ivan;Sanjo, Hideki;Akira, Shizuo;Kotol, Paul F;Glass, Christopher K;Rosenfeld, Michael G;Rose, David W"

Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectH9 ubiquitinates Myc in vivo and in vitro, forming a lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain. Miz1 inhibits this ubiquitination. HectH9-mediated ubiquitination of Myc is required for transactivation of multiple target genes, recruitment of the coactivator p300, and induction of cell proliferation by Myc. HectH9 is overexpressed in multiple human tumors and is essential for proliferation of a subset of tumor cells. Our results suggest that site-specific ubiquitination regulates the switch between an activating and a repressive state of the Myc protein, and they suggest a strategy to interfere with Myc function in vivo.","Adhikary, Sovana;Marinoni, Federica;Hock, Andreas;Hulleman, Esther;Popov, Nikita;Beier, Rudi;Bernard, Sandra;Quarto, Micaela;Capra, Maria;Goettig, Stephan;Kogel, Ulrike;Scheffner, Martin;Helin, Kristian;Eilers, Martin"
16239140,2005,Cell,The menin tumor suppressor protein is an essential oncogenic cofactor for MLL-associated leukemogenesis.,"The Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein is a histone methyltransferase that is mutated in clinically and biologically distinctive subsets of acute leukemia. MLL normally associates with a cohort of highly conserved cofactors to form a macromolecular complex that includes menin, a product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in heritable and sporadic endocrine tumors. We demonstrate here that oncogenic MLL fusion proteins retain an ability to stably associate with menin through a high-affinity, amino-terminal, conserved binding motif and that this interaction is required for the initiation of MLL-mediated leukemogenesis. Furthermore, menin is essential for maintenance of MLL-associated but not other oncogene induced myeloid transformation. Acute genetic ablation of menin reverses aberrant Hox gene expression mediated by MLL-menin promoter-associated complexes, and specifically abrogates the differentiation arrest and oncogenic properties of MLL-transformed leukemic blasts. These results demonstrate that a human oncoprotein is critically dependent on direct physical interaction with a tumor suppressor protein for its oncogenic activity, validate a potential target for molecular therapy, and suggest central roles for menin in altered epigenetic functions underlying the pathogenesis of hematopoietic cancers.","Yokoyama, Akihiko;Somervaille, Tim C P;Smith, Kevin S;Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit;Meyerson, Matthew;Cleary, Michael L"

The human tumor antigen PRAME is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, but its function has remained unclear. We identify here PRAME as a dominant repressor of RAR signaling. PRAME binds to RAR in the presence of RA, preventing ligand-induced receptor activation and target gene transcription through recruitment of Polycomb proteins. PRAME is present at RAR target promoters and inhibits RA-induced differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of PRAME expression by RNA interference in RA-resistant human melanoma restores RAR signaling and reinstates sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of RA in vitro and in vivo.

15989956,2005,Cell,ARF-BP1/Mule is a critical mediator of the ARF tumor suppressor.,"Although the importance of the ARF tumor suppressor in p53 regulation is well established, numerous studies indicate that ARF also suppresses cell growth in a p53/Mdm2-independent manner. To understand the mechanism of ARF-mediated tumor suppression, we identified a ubiquitin ligase, ARF-BP1, as a key factor associated with ARF in vivo. ARF-BP1 harbors a signature HECT motif, and its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by ARF. Notably, inactivation of ARF-BP1, but not Mdm2, suppresses the growth of p53 null cells in a manner reminiscent of ARF induction. Surprisingly, in p53 wild-type cells, ARF-BP1 directly binds and ubiquitinates p53, and inactivation of endogenous ARF-BP1 is crucial for ARF-mediated p53 stabilization. Thus, our study modifies the current view of ARF-mediated p53 activation and reveals that ARF-BP1 is a critical mediator of both the p53-independent and p53-dependent tumor suppressor functions of ARF. As such, ARF-BP1 may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in tumors regardless of p53 status.","Chen, Delin;Kon, Ning;Li, Muyang;Zhang, Wenzhu;Qin, Jun;Gu, Wei"
15989949,2005,Cell,IKKbeta couples hepatocyte death to cytokine-driven compensatory proliferation that promotes chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.,"IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), required for NF-kappaB activation, links chronic inflammation with carcinogenesis. We investigated whether IKKbeta is involved in chemically induced liver cancer, a model not involving overt inflammation. Surprisingly, mice lacking IKKbeta only in hepatocytes (Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice) exhibited a marked increase in hepatocarcinogenesis caused by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). This correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased JNK activation, and hepatocyte death, giving rise to augmented compensatory proliferation of surviving hepatocytes. Brief oral administration of an antioxidant around the time of DEN exposure blocked prolonged JNK activation and compensatory proliferation and prevented excessive DEN-induced carcinogenesis in Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice. Decreased hepatocarcinogenesis was also found in mice lacking IKKbeta in both hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived Kupffer cells. These mice exhibited reduced hepatocyte regeneration and diminished induction of hepatomitogens, which were unaltered in Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice. IKKbeta, therefore, orchestrates inflammatory crosstalk between hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells that promotes chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.","Maeda, Shin;Kamata, Hideaki;Luo, Jun-Li;Leffert, Hyam;Karin, Michael"
15960971,2005,Cell,Identification of bronchioalveolar stem cells in normal lung and lung cancer.,"Injury models have suggested that the lung contains anatomically and functionally distinct epithelial stem cell populations.

Identified at the bronchioalveolar duct junction, BASCs were resistant to bronchiolar and alveolar damage and proliferated during epithelial cell renewal in vivo. BASCs exhibited self-renewal and were multipotent in clonal assays, highlighting their stem cell properties. Furthermore, BASCs expanded in response to oncogenic K-ras in culture and in precursors of lung tumors in vivo. These data support the hypothesis that BASCs are a stem cell population that maintains the bronchiolar Clara cells and alveolar cells of the distal lung and that their transformed counterparts give rise to adenocarcinoma. Although bronchiolar cells and alveolar cells are proposed to be the precursor cells of adenocarcinoma, this work points to BASCs as the putative cells of origin for this subtype of lung cancer.","Kim, Carla F Bender;Jackson, Erica L;Woolfenden, Amber E;Lawrence, Sharon;Babar, Imran;Vogel, Sinae;Crowley, Denise;Bronson, Roderick T;Jacks, Tyler"

Using a coimplantation tumor xenograft model, we demonstrate that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) extracted from human breast carcinomas promote the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells significantly more than do normal mammary fibroblasts derived from the same patients. The CAFs, which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, play a central role in promoting the growth of tumor cells through their ability to secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1); CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into carcinomas, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. CAF-secreted SDF-1 also stimulates tumor growth directly, acting through the cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is expressed by carcinoma cells. Our findings indicate that fibroblasts within invasive breast carcinomas contribute to tumor promotion in large part through the secretion of SDF-1.","Orimo, Akira;Gupta, Piyush B;Sgroi, Dennis C;Arenzana-Seisdedos, Fernando;Delaunay, Thierry;Naeem, Rizwan;Carey, Vincent J;Richardson, Andrea L;Weinberg, Robert A"

TSC tumorigenesis is not always accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) has been found activated in TSC lesions lacking TSC1 or TSC2 LOH. Here, we show that Erk may play a critical role in TSC progression through posttranslational inactivation of TSC2. Erk-dependent phosphorylation leads to TSC1-TSC2 dissociation and markedly impairs TSC2 ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. Importantly, expression of an Erk nonphosphorylatable TSC2 mutant in TSC2+/- tumor cells where Erk is constitutively activated blocks tumorigenecity in vivo, while wild-type TSC2 is ineffective. Our findings position the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream of the TSC complex and suggest that Erk may modulate mTOR signaling and contribute to disease progression through phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2.","Ma, Li;Chen, Zhenbang;Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye;Tempst, Paul;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo"
15851025,2005,Cell,hDOT1L links histone methylation to leukemogenesis.,"Epigenetic modifications play an important role in human cancer. One such modification, histone methylation, contributes to human cancer through deregulation of cancer-relevant genes. The yeast Dot1 and its human counterpart, hDOT1L, methylate lysine 79 located within the globular domain of histone H3. Here we report that hDOT1L interacts with AF10, an MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemia, through the OM-LZ region of AF10 required for MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis. We demonstrate that direct fusion of hDOT1L to MLL results in leukemic transformation in an hDOT1L methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. Transformation by MLL-hDOT1L and MLL-AF10 results in upregulation of a number of leukemia-relevant genes, such as Hoxa9, concomitant with hypermethylation of H3-K79. Our studies thus establish that mistargeting of hDOT1L to Hoxa9 plays an important role in MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis and suggests that the enzymatic activity of hDOT1L may provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","Okada, Yuki;Feng, Qin;Lin, Yihui;Jiang, Qi;Li, Yaqiang;Coffield, Vernon M;Su, Lishan;Xu, Guoliang;Zhang, Yi"

Recent studies have identified the Large tumor suppressor (Lats)/Warts (Wts) protein kinase as a key component of a pathway that controls the coordination between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we describe growth inhibitory functions for a Mob superfamily protein, termed Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor), in Drosophila. Loss of Mats function results in increased cell proliferation, defective apoptosis, and induction of tissue overgrowth. We show that mats and wts function in a common pathway. Mats physically associates with Wts to stimulate the catalytic activity of the Wts kinase. A human Mats ortholog (Mats1) can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in Drosophila. As Mats1 is mutated in human tumors, Mats-mediated growth inhibition and tumor suppression is likely conserved in humans.","Lai, Zhi-Chun;Wei, Xiaomu;Shimizu, Takeshi;Ramos, Edward;Rohrbaugh, Margaret;Nikolaidis, Nikolas;Ho, Li-Lun;Li, Ying"

PAR1 is proposed to be involved in the invasive and metastatic processes of various cancers. However, the protease responsible for activating the proinvasive functions of PAR1 remains to be identified. Here, we show that expression of PAR1 is both required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast carcinoma cells in a xenograft model. Further, we show that the matrix metalloprotease, MMP-1, functions as a protease agonist of PAR1 cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate PAR1-dependent Ca2+ signals and migration. MMP-1 activity is derived from fibroblasts and is absent from the breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that MMP-1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell migration and invasion.","Boire, Adrienne;Covic, Lidija;Agarwal, Anika;Jacques, Suzanne;Sherifi, Sheida;Kuliopulos, Athan"

Although p53+/515A mice display a similar tumor spectrum and survival curve as p53+/- mice, tumors from p53+/515A mice metastasized with high frequency. Correspondingly, the embryonic fibroblasts from the p53515A/515A mutant mice displayed enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation potential. The disruption of p63 and p73 in p53-/- cells increased transformation capacity and reinitiated DNA synthesis to levels observed in p53515A/515A cells. Additionally, p63 and p73 were functionally inactivated in p53515A cells. These results provide in vivo validation for the gain-of-function properties of certain p53 missense mutations and suggest a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.","Lang, Gene A;Iwakuma, Tomoo;Suh, Young-Ah;Liu, Geng;Rao, V Ashutosh;Parant, John M;Valentin-Vega, Yasmine A;Terzian, Tamara;Caldwell, Lisa C;Strong, Louise C;El-Naggar, Adel K;Lozano, Guillermina"
15607980,2004,Cell,Mutant p53 gain of function in two mouse models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly altered in human tumors, predominantly through missense mutations that result in accumulation of mutant p53 protein. These mutations may confer dominant-negative or gain-of-function properties to p53. To ascertain the physiological effects of p53 point mutation, the structural mutant p53R172H and the contact mutant p53R270H (codons 175 and 273 in humans) were engineered into the endogenous p53 locus in mice. p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice are models of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome; they developed allele-specific tumor spectra distinct from p53+/- mice. In addition, p53R270H/- and p53R172H/- mice developed novel tumors compared to p53-/- mice, including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors. Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in primary cells derived from p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice. These results demonstrate that point mutant p53 alleles expressed under physiological control have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond the simple loss of p53 function.","Olive, Kenneth P;Tuveson, David A;Ruhe, Zachary C;Yin, Bob;Willis, Nicholas A;Bronson, Roderick T;Crowley, Denise;Jacks, Tyler"

It is therefore reasonable to assume that naturally occurring polymorphic genetic variants in the p53 stress response pathway might determine an individual's susceptibility to cancer. A central node in the p53 pathway is the MDM2 protein, a direct negative regulator of p53. In this report, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309) is found in the MDM2 promoter and is shown to increase the affinity of the transcriptional activator Sp1, resulting in higher levels of MDM2 RNA and protein and the subsequent attenuation of the p53 pathway. In humans, SNP309 is shown to associate with accelerated tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic cancers. A model is proposed whereby SNP309 serves as a rate-limiting event in carcinogenesis.","Bond, Gareth L;Hu, Wenwei;Bond, Elisabeth E;Robins, Harlan;Lutzker, Stuart G;Arva, Nicoleta C;Bargonetti, Jill;Bartel, Frank;Taubert, Helge;Wuerl, Peter;Onel, Kenan;Yip, Linwah;Hwang, Shih-Jen;Strong, Louise C;Lozano, Guillermina;Levine, Arnold J"

Inactivation of JunB in postnatal mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling early human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Here, we show that JunB regulates the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD.","Passegué, Emmanuelle;Wagner, Erwin F;Weissman, Irving L"

15369676,2004,Cell,JunD reduces tumor angiogenesis by protecting cells from oxidative stress.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancer. In this study, we show that JunD, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, reduces tumor angiogenesis by limiting Ras-mediated production of ROS. Using junD-deficient cells, we demonstrate that JunD regulates genes involved in antioxidant defense, H2O2 production, and angiogenesis. The accumulation of H2O2 in junD-/- cells decreases the availability of FeII and reduces the activity of HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that target hypoxia-inducible factors-alpha (HIFalpha) for degradation. Subsequently, HIF-alpha proteins accumulate and enhance the transcription of VEGF-A, a potent proangiogenic factor. Our study uncovers the mechanism by which JunD protects cells from oxidative stress and exerts an antiangiogenic effect. Furthermore, we provide new insights into the regulation of PHD activity, allowing immediate reactive adaptation to changes in O2 or iron levels in the cell.","Gerald, Damien;Berra, Edurne;Frapart, Yves M;Chan, Denise A;Giaccia, Amato J;Mansuy, Daniel;Pouysségur, Jacques;Yaniv, Moshe;Mechta-Grigoriou, Fatima"

15294155,2004,Cell,IKKbeta links inflammation and tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer.,"A link between inflammation and cancer has long been suspected, but its molecular nature remained ill defined. A key player in inflammation is transcription factor NF-kappaB whose activity is triggered in response to infectious agents and proinflammatory cytokines via the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. Using a colitis-associated cancer model, we show that although deletion of IKKbeta in intestinal epithelial cells does not decrease inflammation, it leads to a dramatic decrease in tumor incidence without affecting tumor size. This is linked to increased epithelial apoptosis during tumor promotion. Deleting IKKbeta in myeloid cells, however, results in a significant decrease in tumor size. This deletion diminishes expression of proinflammatory cytokines that may serve as tumor growth factors, without affecting apoptosis. Thus, specific inactivation of the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway in two different cell types can attenuate formation of inflammation-associated tumors. In addition to suppressing apoptosis in advanced tumors, IKKbeta may link inflammation to cancer.","Greten, Florian R;Eckmann, Lars;Greten, Tim F;Park, Jin Mo;Li, Zhi-Wei;Egan, Laurence J;Kagnoff, Martin F;Karin, Michael"

Profiles of cancer cell signaling networks might therefore identify mechanisms by which such cells interpret environmental cues for continued growth. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we monitored phospho-protein responses to environmental cues in acute myeloid leukemia at the single cell level. By exposing cancer cell signaling networks to potentiating inputs, rather than relying upon the basal levels of protein phosphorylation alone, we could discern unique cancer network profiles that correlated with genetics and disease outcome. Strikingly, individual cancers manifested multiple cell subsets with unique network profiles, reflecting cancer heterogeneity at the level of signaling response. The results revealed a dramatic remodeling of signaling networks in cancer cells. Thus, single cell measurements of phospho-protein responses reveal shifts in signaling potential of a phospho-protein network, allowing for categorizing of cell network phenotypes by multidimensional molecular profiles of signaling.","Irish, Jonathan M;Hovland, Randi;Krutzik, Peter O;Perez, Omar D;Bruserud, Øystein;Gjertsen, Bjørn T;Nolan, Garry P"
15210113,2004,Cell,"Twist, a master regulator of morphogenesis, plays an essential role in tumor metastasis.","Metastasis is a multistep process during which cancer cells disseminate from the site of primary tumors and establish secondary tumors in distant organs. In a search for key regulators of metastasis in a murine breast tumor model, we have found that the transcription factor Twist, a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis, plays an essential role in metastasis. Suppression of Twist expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, activation of mesenchymal markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In human breast cancers, high level of Twist expression is correlated with invasive lobular carcinoma, a highly infiltrating tumor type associated with loss of E-cadherin expression. These results establish a mechanistic link between Twist, EMT, and tumor metastasis.","Yang, Jing;Mani, Sendurai A;Donaher, Joana Liu;Ramaswamy, Sridhar;Itzykson, Raphael A;Come, Christophe;Savagner, Pierre;Gitelman, Inna;Richardson, Andrea;Weinberg, Robert A"

Their transcriptional output is controlled via a two-tiered mechanism of phosphorylation and acetylation. Modest alterations of this balance can result in profound effects.

We investigated the pathological relationship between phosphoylated-Akt (Akt-p) and FOXO3a in primary tumors. Surprisingly, FOXO3a was found to be excluded from the nuclei of some tumors lacking Akt-p, suggesting an Akt-independent mechanism of regulating FOXO3a localization. We provide evidence for such a mechanism by showing that IkappaB kinase (IKK) physically interacts with, phosphorylates, and inhibits FOXO3a independent of Akt and causes proteolysis of FOXO3a via the Ub-dependent proteasome pathway. Cytoplasmic FOXO3a correlates with expression of IKKbeta or Akt-p in many tumors and associates with poor survival in breast cancer. Further, constitutive expression of IKKbeta promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis that can be overridden by FOXO3a. These results suggest the negative regulation of FOXO factors by IKK as a key mechanism for promoting cell growth and tumorigenesis.","Hu, Mickey C-T;Lee, Dung-Fang;Xia, Weiya;Golfman, Leonard S;Ou-Yang, Fu;Yang, Jer-Yen;Zou, Yiyu;Bao, Shilai;Hanada, Norihisa;Saso, Hitomi;Kobayashi, Ryuji;Hung, Mien-Chie"

Smad proteins activated by TGF-beta form a complex with FoxO proteins to turn on the growth inhibitory gene p21Cip1. This process is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway, a known inhibitor of FoxO localization in the nucleus, and by the telencephalic development factor FoxG1, which we show binds to FoxO-Smad complexes and blocks p21Cip1 expression. We suggest that the activity of this network confers resistance to TGF-beta-mediated cytostasis during the development of the telencephalic neuroepithelium and in glioblastoma brain tumor cells.","Seoane, Joan;Le, Hong-Van;Shen, Lijian;Anderson, Stewart A;Massagué, Joan"

15035987,2004,Cell,Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF.,"Over 30 mutations of the B-RAF gene associated with human cancers have been identified, the majority of which are located within the kinase domain. Here we show that of 22 B-RAF mutants analyzed, 18 have elevated kinase activity and signal to ERK in vivo. Surprisingly, three mutants have reduced kinase activity towards MEK in vitro but, by activating C-RAF in vivo, signal to ERK in cells. The structures of wild type and oncogenic V599EB-RAF kinase domains in complex with the RAF inhibitor BAY43-9006 show that the activation segment is held in an inactive conformation by association with the P loop. The clustering of most mutations to these two regions suggests that disruption of this interaction converts B-RAF into its active conformation. The high activity mutants signal to ERK by directly phosphorylating MEK, whereas the impaired activity mutants stimulate MEK by activating endogenous C-RAF, possibly via an allosteric or transphosphorylation mechanism.","Wan, Paul T C;Garnett, Mathew J;Roe, S Mark;Lee, Sharlene;Niculescu-Duvaz, Dan;Good, Valerie M;Jones, C Michael;Marshall, Christopher J;Springer, Caroline J;Barford, David;Marais, Richard"

EMSY is capable of silencing the activation potential of BRCA2 exon 3, associates with chromatin regulators HP1beta and BS69, and localizes to sites of repair following DNA damage. EMSY maps to chromosome 11q13.5, a region known to be involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We show that the EMSY gene is amplified almost exclusively in sporadic breast cancer (13%) and higher-grade ovarian cancer (17%). In addition, EMSY amplification is associated with worse survival, particularly in node-negative breast cancer, suggesting that it may be of prognostic value. The remarkable clinical overlap between sporadic EMSY amplification and familial BRCA2 deletion implicates a BRCA2 pathway in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer.","Hughes-Davies, Luke;Huntsman, David;Ruas, Margarida;Fuks, Francois;Bye, Jacqueline;Chin, Suet-Feung;Milner, Jonathon;Brown, Lindsay A;Hsu, Forrest;Gilks, Blake;Nielsen, Torsten;Schulzer, Michael;Chia, Stephen;Ragaz, Joseph;Cahn, Anthony;Linger, Lori;Ozdag, Hilal;Cattaneo, Elena;Jordanova, E S;Schuuring, Edward;Yu, David S;Venkitaraman, Ashok;Ponder, Bruce;Doherty, Aidan;Aparicio, Samuel;Bentley, David;Theillet, Charles;Ponting, Chris P;Caldas, Carlos;Kouzarides, Tony"

PML-RARalpha is cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease is neutrophil elastase (NE). Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that the cleavage of PML-RARalpha must occur within the cell, and perhaps, within the nucleus. The functional importance of NE for APL development was assessed in NE deficient mice. Greater than 90% of bone marrow PML-RARalpha cleaving activity was lost in the absence of NE, and NE (but not Cathepsin G) deficient animals were protected from APL development. Primary mouse and human APL cells also contain NE-dependent PML-RARalpha cleaving activity. Since NE is maximally produced in promyelocytes, this protease may play a role in APL pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARalpha.","Lane, Andrew A;Ley, Timothy J"

A variety of extracellular stimuli, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), activate Cdc42. Here, we show that activation of Cdc42 protects the EGF receptor from the negative regulatory activity of the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase. Activated Cdc42 binds to p85Cool-1 (for cloned-out-of-library)/beta-Pix (for Pak-interactive exchange factor), a protein that directly associates with c-Cbl. This inhibits the binding of Cbl by the EGF receptor and thus prevents Cbl from catalyzing receptor ubiquitination. The role played by Cdc42 in regulating the timing of EGF receptor-Cbl interactions is underscored by the fact that constitutively active Cdc42(F28L), by persistently blocking the binding of Cbl to these receptors, leads to their aberrant accumulation and sustained EGF-stimulated ERK activation, thus resulting in cellular transformation.","Wu, Wen Jin;Tu, Shine;Cerione, Richard A"
12914700,2003,Cell,Histone H2AX: a dosage-dependent suppressor of oncogenic translocations and tumors.,"We employed gene targeting to study H2AX, a histone variant phosphorylated in chromatin surrounding DNA double-strand breaks. Mice deficient for both H2AX and p53 (H(delta/delta)P(-/-)) rapidly developed immature T and B lymphomas and solid tumors. Moreover, H2AX haploinsufficiency caused genomic instability in normal cells and, on a p53-deficient background, early onset of various tumors including more mature B lymphomas. Most H2AX(delta/delta)p53(-/-) or H2AX(+/delta)p53(-/-) B lineage lymphomas harbored chromosome 12 (IgH)/15 (c-myc) translocations with hallmarks of either aberrant V(D)J or class switch recombination. In contrast, H2AX(delta/delta)p53(-/-) thymic lymphomas had clonal translocations that did not involve antigen receptor loci and which likely occurred during cellular expansion. Thus, H2AX helps prevent aberrant repair of both programmed and general DNA breakage and, thereby, functions as a dosage-dependent suppressor of genomic instability and tumors in mice. Notably, H2AX maps to a cytogenetic region frequently altered in human cancers, possibly implicating similar functions in man.","Bassing, Craig H;Suh, Heikyung;Ferguson, David O;Chua, Katrin F;Manis, John;Eckersdorff, Mark;Gleason, Megan;Bronson, Rodrick;Lee, Charles;Alt, Frederick W"

The mechanisms used by tumor cells to circumvent endogenous antigrowth signals have yet to be clearly defined. We find that the matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, confers tumor cells with a distinct 3D growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. The replicative advantage conferred by MT1-MMP requires pericellular proteolysis of the ECM, as proliferation is fully suppressed when tumor cells are suspended in 3D gels of protease-resistant collagen. In the absence of proteolysis, tumor cells embedded in physiologically relevant ECM matrices are trapped in a compact, spherical configuration and unable to undergo changes in cell shape or cytoskeletal reorganization required for 3D growth. These observations identify MT1-MMP as a tumor-derived growth factor that regulates proliferation by controlling cell geometry within the confines of the 3D ECM.","Hotary, Kevin B;Allen, Edward D;Brooks, Peter C;Datta, Nabanita S;Long, Michael W;Weiss, Stephen J"

To explore telomerase regulation, we employed a general genetic screen to identify negative regulators of hTERT. We discovered three tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways involved in hTERT repression. One, the Mad1/c-Myc pathway, had been previously implicated in hTERT regulation. The second, SIP1, a transcriptional target of the TGF-beta pathway, mediates the TGF-beta regulated repression of hTERT. The third, the tumor suppressor Menin, is a direct repressor of hTERT. Depleting Menin immortalizes primary human fibroblasts and causes a transformation phenotype when coupled with expression of SV40 Large and Small T antigen and oncogenic ras. These studies suggest that multiple tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways coordinately repress hTERT expression and imply that telomerase is reactivated in human tumors through oncogenic mutations.","Lin, Shiaw Yih;Elledge, Stephen J"

Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation and also through the biological functions of target loci. Here, we identify the product of human MTA3 as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2/NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, an event associated with changes in epithelial architecture and invasive growth.

Liver-specific inactivation of c-Jun at different stages of tumor development was used to study its role in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in mice. The requirement for c-jun was restricted to early stages of tumor development, and the number and size of hepatic tumors was dramatically reduced when c-jun was inactivated after the tumor had initiated. The impaired tumor development correlated with increased levels of p53 and its target gene noxa, resulting in the induction of apoptosis without affecting cell proliferation. Primary hepatocytes lacking c-Jun showed increased sensitivity to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, which was abrogated in the absence of p53.

12408869,2002,Cell,Beta-catenin and TCF mediate cell positioning in the intestinal epithelium by controlling the expression of EphB/ephrinB.,"In the small intestine, the progeny of stem cells migrate in precise patterns. Absorptive, enteroendocrine, and goblet cells migrate toward the villus while Paneth cells occupy the bottom of the crypts. We show here that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control the expression of the EphB2/EphB3 receptors and their ligand ephrin-B1 in colorectal cancer and along the crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes reveals that their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3 null mice, the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingle. In adult EphB3(-/-) mice, Paneth cells do not follow their downward migratory path, but scatter along crypt and villus. We conclude that in the intestinal epithelium beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the EphB/ephrin-B system.","Batlle, Eduard;Henderson, Jeffrey T;Beghtel, Harry;van den Born, Maaike M W;Sancho, Elena;Huls, Gerwin;Meeldijk, Jan;Robertson, Jennifer;van de Wetering, Marc;Pawson, Tony;Clevers, Hans"
12408868,2002,Cell,The beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex imposes a crypt progenitor phenotype on colorectal cancer cells.,"The transactivation of TCF target genes induced by Wnt pathway mutations constitutes the primary transforming event in colorectal cancer (CRC). We show that disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity in CRC cells induces a rapid G1 arrest and blocks a genetic program that is physiologically active in the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21(CIP1/WAF1) transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation. Thus, the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells.","van de Wetering, Marc;Sancho, Elena;Verweij, Cornelis;de Lau, Wim;Oving, Irma;Hurlstone, Adam;van der Horn, Karin;Batlle, Eduard;Coudreuse, Damien;Haramis, Anna Pavlina;Tjon-Pon-Fong, Menno;Moerer, Petra;van den Born, Maaike;Soete, Gwen;Pals, Steven;Eilers, Martin;Medema, Rene;Clevers, Hans"
12372299,2002,Cell,The circadian gene Period2 plays an important role in tumor suppression and DNA damage response in vivo.,"The Period2 gene plays a key role in controlling circadian rhythm in mice. We report here that mice deficient in the mPer2 gene are cancer prone. After gamma radiation, these mice show a marked increase in tumor development and reduced apoptosis in thymocytes. The core circadian genes are induced by gamma radiation in wild-type mice but not in mPer2 mutant mice. Temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2, and Gadd45alpha, is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice. In particular, the transcription of c-myc is controlled directly by circadian regulators and is deregulated in the mPer2 mutant. Our studies suggest that the mPer2 gene functions in tumor suppression by regulating DNA damage-responsive pathways.","Fu, Loning;Pelicano, Helene;Liu, Jinsong;Huang, Peng;Lee, Cheng"
12372298,2002,Cell,The role of apoptosis in creating and maintaining luminal space within normal and oncogene-expressing mammary acini.,"We have utilized in vitro three-dimensional epithelial cell cultures to analyze the role of apoptosis in the formation and maintenance of a hollow glandular architecture. Lumen formation is associated with the selective apoptosis of centrally located cells; this apoptosis follows apicobasal polarization and precedes proliferative suppression during acinar development. Notably, either inhibiting apoptosis (by exogenously expressing antiapoptotic Bcl family proteins) or enhancing proliferation (via Cyclin D1 or HPV E7 overexpression) does not result in luminal filling, suggesting glandular architecture is resistant to such isolated oncogenic insults. However, the lumen is filled when oncogenes that enhance proliferation are coexpressed with those that inhibit apoptosis, or when ErbB2, which induces both activities, is activated by homodimerization. Hence, apoptosis can counteract increased proliferation to maintain luminal space, suggesting that tumor cells must restrain apoptosis to populate the lumen.","Debnath, Jayanta;Mills, Kenna R;Collins, Nicole L;Reginato, Mauricio J;Muthuswamy, Senthil K;Brugge, Joan S"
12297048,2002,Cell,Presenilin couples the paired phosphorylation of beta-catenin independent of axin: implications for beta-catenin activation in tumorigenesis.,"The Alzheimer's disease-linked gene presenilin 1 (PS1) is required for intramembrane proteolysis of APP and Notch. In addition, recent observations strongly implicate PS1 as a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, although the mechanism underlying this activity is unknown. Here, we show that presenilin functions as a scaffold that rapidly couples beta-catenin phosphorylation through two sequential kinase activities independent of the Wnt-regulated Axin/CK1alpha complex. Thus, presenilin deficiency results in increased beta-catenin stability in vitro and in vivo by disconnecting the stepwise phosphorylation of beta-catenin, both in the presence and absence of Wnt stimulation. These findings highlight an aspect of beta-catenin regulation outside of the canonical Wnt-regulated pathway and a function of presenilin separate from intramembrane proteolysis.","Kang, David E;Soriano, Salvador;Xia, Xuefeng;Eberhart, Charles G;De Strooper, Bart;Zheng, Hui;Koo, Edward H"
12202036,2002,Cell,salvador Promotes both cell cycle exit and apoptosis in Drosophila and is mutated in human cancer cell lines.,"The number of cells in an organism is determined by regulating both cell proliferation and cell death. Relatively few mechanisms have been identified that can modulate both of these processes. In a screen for Drosophila mutations that result in tissue overgrowth, we identified salvador (sav), a gene that promotes both cell cycle exit and cell death. Elevated Cyclin E and DIAP1 levels are found in mutant cells, resulting in delayed cell cycle exit and impaired apoptosis. Salvador contains two WW domains and binds to the Warts (or LATS) protein kinase. The human ortholog of salvador (hWW45) is mutated in three cancer cell lines. Thus, salvador restricts cell numbers in vivo by functioning as a dual regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis.","Tapon, Nicolas;Harvey, Kieran F;Bell, Daphne W;Wahrer, Doke C R;Schiripo, Taryn A;Haber, Daniel  A;Hariharan, Iswar K"

12086670,2002,Cell,Bcl2 regulation by the melanocyte master regulator Mitf modulates lineage survival and melanoma cell viability.,"Kit/SCF signaling and Mitf-dependent transcription are both essential for melanocyte development and pigmentation. To identify Mitf-dependent Kit transcriptional targets in primary melanocytes, microarray studies were undertaken. Among identified targets was BCL2, whose germline deletion produces melanocyte loss and which exhibited phenotypic synergy with Mitf in mice. BCL2's regulation by Mitf was verified in melanocytes and melanoma cells and by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BCL2 promoter. Mitf also regulates BCL2 in osteoclasts, and both Mitf(mi/mi) and Bcl2(-/-) mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis. Disruption of Mitf in melanocytes or melanoma triggered profound apoptosis susceptible to rescue by BCL2 overexpression. Clinically, primary human melanoma expression microarrays revealed tight nearest neighbor linkage for MITF and BCL2. This linkage helps explain the vital roles of both Mitf and Bcl2 in the melanocyte lineage and the well-known treatment resistance of melanoma.","McGill, Gaël G;Horstmann, Martin;Widlund, Hans R;Du, Jinyan;Motyckova, Gabriela;Nishimura, Emi K;Lin, Yi-Ling;Ramaswamy, Sridhar;Avery, William;Ding, Han-Fei;Jordan, Siobhán A;Jackson, Ian J;Korsmeyer, Stanley J;Golub, Todd R;Fisher, David E"
12015983,2002,Cell,A senescence program controlled by p53 and p16INK4a contributes to the outcome of cancer therapy.,"p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance, in part, by disabling apoptosis. We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a). Hence, tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Moreover, tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53, p16(INK4a), and senescence markers, and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage. Finally, mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects. Therefore, cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo.","Schmitt, Clemens A;Fridman, Jordan S;Yang, Meng;Lee, Soyoung;Baranov, Eugene;Hoffman, Robert M;Lowe, Scott W"
12015982,2002,Cell,Suppression of Myc-induced apoptosis in beta cells exposes multiple oncogenic properties of Myc and triggers carcinogenic progression.,"To explore the role of c-Myc in carcinogenesis, we have developed a reversible transgenic model of pancreatic beta cell oncogenesis using a switchable form of the c-Myc protein. Activation of c-Myc in adult, mature beta cells induces uniform beta cell proliferation but is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly erodes beta cell mass. Thus, the oncogenic potential of c-Myc in beta cells is masked by apoptosis. Upon suppression of c-Myc-induced beta cell apoptosis by coexpression of Bcl-x(L), c-Myc triggers rapid and uniform progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors. Subsequent c-Myc deactivation induces rapid regression associated with vascular degeneration and beta cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that highly complex neoplastic lesions can be both induced and maintained in vivo by a simple combination of two interlocking molecular lesions.","Pelengaris, Stella;Khan, Michael;Evan, Gerard I"

Between 45% and 60% of human gastric cancer cells do not significantly express RUNX3 due to hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter region. Tumorigenicity of human gastric cancer cell lines in nude mice was inversely related to their level of RUNX3 expression, and a mutation (R122C) occurring within the conserved Runt domain abolished the tumor-suppressive effect of RUNX3, suggesting that a lack of RUNX3 function is causally related to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer.","Li, Qing Lin;Ito, Kosei;Sakakura, Chohei;Fukamachi, Hiroshi;Inoue, Ken ichi;Chi, Xin Zi;Lee, Kwang Youl;Nomura, Shintaro;Lee, Chang Woo;Han, Sang Bae;Kim, Hwan Mook;Kim, Wun Jae;Yamamoto, Hiromitsu;Yamashita, Namiko;Yano, Takashi;Ikeda, Toshio;Itohara, Shigeyoshi;Inazawa, Johji;Abe, Tatsuo;Hagiwara, Akeo;Yamagishi, Hisakazu;Ooe, Asako;Kaneda, Atsushi;Sugimura, Takashi;Ushijima, Toshikazu;Bae, Suk Chul;Ito, Yoshiaki"

We previously found that a membrane-anchored glycoprotein, RECK, negatively regulates MMP-9 and inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis. Here we show that RECK regulates two other MMPs, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, known to be involved in cancer progression, that mice lacking a functional RECK gene die around E10.5 with defects in collagen fibrils, the basal lamina, and vascular development, and that this phenotype is partially suppressed by MMP-2 null mutation. Also, vascular sprouting is dramatically suppressed in tumors derived from RECK-expressing fibrosarcoma cells grown in nude mice. These results support a role for RECK in the regulation of MMP-2 in vivo and implicate RECK downregulation in tumor angiogenesis.","Oh, J;Takahashi, R;Kondo, S;Mizoguchi, A;Adachi, E;Sasahara, R M;Nishimura, S;Imamura, Y;Kitayama, H;Alexander, D B;Ide, C;Horan, T P;Arakawa, T;Yoshida, H;Nishikawa, S;Itoh, Y;Seiki, M;Itohara, S;Takahashi, C;Noda, M"
11733063,2001,Cell,A signaling adapter function for alpha6beta4 integrin in the control of HGF-dependent invasive growth.,"alpha6beta4 integrin and the Met receptor for HGF have been shown independently to promote invasive growth. We demonstrate here that Met selectively associates with alpha6beta4. In carcinoma cells expressing Met alone, HGF does not exert significant biological effects. Ectopic expression of alpha6beta4 restores HGF-regulated processes. Following Met activation, alpha6beta4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and combines with Shc and PI3K, generating an additional signaling platform that potentiates HGF-triggered activation of Ras- and PI3K-dependent pathways. In the presence of an alpha6beta4 mutant defective for Shc recruitment, Met cannot sustain HGF-mediated responses. Surprisingly, a truncated beta4 unable to bind laminins retains the activity of wild-type alpha6beta4. Such findings invoke an unexpected role for alpha6beta4 in cancer invasion as a functional amplifier of biochemical outputs rather than a mechanical adhesive device.","Trusolino, L;Bertotti, A;Comoglio, P M"

Other components include the myc- and p/CAF-associated cofactor, TRRAP/PAF400, the DNA helicases TAP54alpha/beta, actin-like proteins, and the human homolog of the Drosophila Enhancer of Polycomb protein. An E1A mutant, defective in p400 binding, is also defective in transformation. Certain p400 fragments partially rescued this phenotype, underscoring the role of E1A-p400 complex formation in the E1A transforming process. Furthermore, E1A and c-myc each alter the subunit composition of p400 complexes, implying that physiological p400 complex formation contributes to transformation suppression.","Fuchs, M;Gerber, J;Drapkin, R;Sif, S;Ikura, T;Ogryzko, V;Lane, W S;Nakatani, Y;Livingston, D M"

We also show that the Tsc1 protein binds to Drosophila Tsc2 in vitro. Overexpression of Tsc1 or Tsc2 alone in the wing and eye has no effect, but co-overexpression leads to a decrease in cell size, cell number, and organ size. Genetic epistasis data are consistent with a model that Tsc1 and Tsc2 function together in the insulin signaling pathway.","Potter, C J;Huang, H;Xu, T"
11348591,2001,Cell,The Drosophila tuberous sclerosis complex gene homologs restrict cell growth and cell proliferation.,"The inherited human disease tuberous sclerosis, characterized by hamartomatous tumors, results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2.

Inactivating mutations in either gene cause an identical phenotype characterized by enhanced growth and increased cell size with no change in ploidy. Overall, mutant cells spend less time in G1. Coexpression of both Tsc1 and Tsc2 restricts tissue growth and reduces cell size and cell proliferation. This phenotype is modulated by manipulations in cyclin levels. In postmitotic mutant cells, levels of Cyclin E and Cyclin A are elevated. This correlates with a tendency for these cells to reenter the cell cycle inappropriately as is observed in the human lesions.","Tapon, N;Ito, N;Dickson, B J;Treisman, J E;Hariharan, I K"

Similarly, mice reconstituted with ES cell-derived junB-/- fetal liver cells also develop a myeloproliferative disease. In both cases, the absence of JunB expression results in increased numbers of granulocyte progenitors, which display enhanced GM-CSF-mediated proliferation and extended survival, associated with changes in the expression levels of the GM-CSFalpha receptor, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bclx, and the cell cycle regulators p16(INK4a) and c-Jun. Importantly, ectopic expression of JunB fully reverts the immature and hyperproliferative phenotype of JunB-deficient myeloid cells.

Tetranucleotide recognition is supported by an aliphatic alpha helix/beta sheet RNA-binding platform, which mimics 5'-Ura-Gua-3' by making Watson-Crick-like hydrogen bonds with 5'-Cyt-Ade-3'.

Correspondingly, the loss of telomere function and p53 deficiency cooperated to initiate the transformation process. Together, these studies establish a key role for p53 in the cellular response to telomere dysfunction in both normal and neoplastic cells, question the significance of crisis as a tumor suppressor mechanism, and identify a biologically relevant stage of advanced crisis, termed genetic catastrophe.","Chin, L;Artandi, S E;Shen, Q;Tam, A;Lee, S L;Gottlieb, G J;Greider, C W;DePinho, R A"
10338215,1999,Cell,Short dysfunctional telomeres impair tumorigenesis in the INK4a(delta2/3) cancer-prone mouse.,"Maintenance of telomere length is predicted to be essential for bypass of senescence and crisis checkpoints in cancer cells. The impact of telomere dysfunction on tumorigenesis was assessed in successive generations of mice doubly null for the telomerase RNA (mTR) and the INK4a tumor suppressor genes. Significant reductions in tumor formation in vivo and oncogenic potential in vitro were observed in late generations of telomerase deficiency, coincident with severe telomere shortening and associated dysfunction. Reintroduction of mTR into cells significantly restored the oncogenic potential, indicating telomerase activation is a cooperating event in the malignant transformation of cells containing critically short telomeres. The results described here demonstrate that loss of telomere function in a cancer-prone mouse model possessing intact DNA damage responses impairs, but does not prevent, tumor formation.","Greenberg, R A;Chin, L;Femino, A;Lee, K H;Gottlieb, G J;Singer, R H;Greider, C W;DePinho, R A"

The telomerase null mouse provides an opportunity to understand the effects associated with critical telomere shortening at the organismal level. We studied a variety of physiological processes in an aging cohort of mTR-/- mice. Loss of telomere function did not elicit a full spectrum of classical pathophysiological symptoms of aging. However, age-dependent telomere shortening and accompanying genetic instability were associated with shortened life span as well as a reduced capacity to respond to stresses such as wound healing and hematopoietic ablation. In addition, we found an increased incidence of spontaneous malignancies. These findings demonstrate a critical role for telomere length in the overall fitness, reserve, and well being of the aging organism.","Rudolph, K L;Chang, S;Lee, H W;Blasco, M;Gottlieb, G J;Greider, C;DePinho, R A"

Bcl10 is a cellular homolog of the equine herpesvirus-2 E10 gene: both contain an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) homologous to that found in several apoptotic molecules. Bcl10 and E10 activated NF-kappaB but caused apoptosis of 293 cells. Bcl10 expressed in a MALT lymphoma exhibited a frameshift mutation resulting in truncation distal to the CARD. Truncated Bcl10 activated NF-kappaB but did not induce apoptosis. Wild-type Bcl10 suppressed transformation, whereas mutant forms had lost this activity and displayed gain-of-function transforming activity.

To investigate the biological functions of a mammalian SH2/SH3 adaptor, we have introduced a null mutation into the mouse gene for Grb2. Analysis of mutant embryonic stem cells, embryos, and chimeras reveals that Grb2 is required during embyrogenesis for the differentiation of endodermal cells and formation of the epiblast. Grb2 acts physiologically as an adaptor, since replacing the C terminus of the Ras activator Sos1 with the Grb2 SH2 domain yields a fusion protein that largely rescues the defects caused by the Grb2 mutation. Furthermore, Grb2 is rate limiting for mammary carcinomas induced by polyomavirus middle T antigen. These data provide genetic evidence for a mammalian Grb2-Ras signaling pathway, mediated by SH2/SH3 domain interactions, that has multiple functions in embryogenesis and cancer.","Cheng, A M;Saxton, T M;Sakai, R;Kulkarni, S;Mbamalu, G;Vogel, W;Tortorice, C G;Cardiff, R D;Cross, J C;Muller, W J;Pawson, T"

We report that this pathway operates in keratinocytes and that mice expressing a stabilized beta-catenin controlled by an epidermal promoter undergo a process resembling de novo hair morphogenesis. The new follicles formed sebaceous glands and dermal papilla, normally established only in embryogenesis. As in embryologically initiated hair germs, transgenic follicles induce Lef-1, but follicles are disoriented and defective in sonic hedgehog polarization. Additionally, proliferation continues unchecked, resulting in two types of tumors also found in humans. Our findings suggest that transient beta-catenin stabilization may be a key player in the long-sought epidermal signal leading to hair development and implicate aberrant beta-catenin activation in hair tumors.","Gat, U;DasGupta, R;Degenstein, L;Fuchs, E"

Between 4 and 6 months of age, the Smad3 mutant mice become moribund with colorectal adenocarcinomas. The neoplasms penetrate through the intestinal wall and metastasize to lymph nodes.

We have developed a human Alu sequence PCR-based assay to quantitate intravasated cells in an in vivo model. We demonstrated that metalloproteinases (MMPs), and most likely MMP-9, are required for intravasation by showing that marimastat, an inhibitor of MMPs, reduced intravasation by more than 90%, and that only tumor cell lines expressing MMP-9 intravasated. Cells with low surface urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA receptor (uPAR) were also incapable of intravasation, despite the presence of high levels of MMP-9. We concluded that breaching of the vascular wall is a rate-limiting step for intravasation, and consequently for metastasis, and that cooperation between uPA/uPAR and MMP-9 is required to complete this step.","Kim, J;Yu, W;Kovalski, K;Ossowski, L"

COX-2-overexpressing cells produce prostaglandins, proangiogenic factors, and stimulate both endothelial migration and tube formation, while control cells have little activity. The effect is inhibited by antibodies to combinations of angiogenic factors, by NS-398 (a selective COX-2 inhibitor), and by aspirin. NS-398 does not inhibit production of angiogenic factors or angiogenesis induced by COX-2-negative cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with aspirin or a COX-1 antisense oligonucleotide inhibits COX-1 activity/expression and suppresses tube formation.

We then introduced the Dpc4 mutation into the Apc(delta716) knockout mice, a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis. Because both Apc and Dpc4 are located on chromosome 18, we constructed compound heterozygotes carrying both mutations on the same chromosome by meiotic recombination. In such mice, intestinal polyps developed into more malignant tumors than those in the simple Apc(delta716) heterozygotes, showing an extensive stromal cell proliferation, submucosal invasion, cell type heterogeneity, and in vivo transplantability. These results indicate that mutations in DPC4 (SMAD4) play a significant role in the malignant progression of colorectal tumors.","Takaku, K;Oshima, M;Miyoshi, H;Matsui, M;Seldin, M F;Taketo, M M"
9428518,1997,Cell,Activation of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase by the alpha6beta4 integrin promotes carcinoma invasion.,"We demonstrate that the alpha6beta4 integrin promotes carcinoma invasion through a preferential and localized targeting of phosphoinositide-3 OH kinase (PI3K) activity. Stable expression of alpha6beta4 increased carcinoma invasion in a PI3K-dependent manner, and transient expression of a constitutively active PI3K increased invasion in the absence of alpha6beta4. Ligation of alpha6beta4 stimulated significantly more PI3K activity than ligation of beta1 integrins, establishing specificity among integrins for PI3K activation. Alpha6beta4-regulated PI3K activity was required for the formation of lamellae, dynamic sites of motility, in carcinoma cells. The small G protein Rac is required downstream of PI3K for invasion. These studies define a mechanism by which the alpha6beta4 integrin promotes carcinoma invasion and invoke a novel function for PI3K signaling.","Shaw, L M;Rabinovitz, I;Wang, H H;Toker, A;Mercurio, A M"

Repair of 1, 2, and 4 nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches was unaffected. Mice that were homozygous for the mutation had a reduced life span. The mice developed a spectrum of tumors, the most predominant of which were gastrointestinal tumors and B- as well as T-cell lymphomas. The tumors did not show any microsatellite instability.

Our analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines with 1p and p73 loss of heterozygosity failed to detect coding sequence mutations in remaining p73 alleles. However, the demonstration that p73 is monoallelically expressed supports the notion that it is a candidate gene in neuroblastoma. p73 also has the potential to activate p53 target genes and to interact with p53.

Successive passages (more than three) of cultures established from the tumors resulted in complete depletion of macrophages; steady-state MME mRNA, elastinolytic activity, and production of angiostatin (in the presence of plasminogen) were correspondingly reduced. Coculture of macrophages with either 3LL cells or their conditioned media containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in secretion of MME and production of angiostatin by the macrophages, suggesting that angiostatin is produced by tumor-infiltrating macrophages whose MME expression is stimulated by tumor cell-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.","Dong, Z;Kumar, R;Yang, X;Fidler, I J"

All tissues were enlarged and contained more cells, although endocrine abnormalities were not evident. Thymic hyperplasia was associated with increased T lymphocyte proliferation, and T cells showed enhanced IL-2 responsiveness in vitro. Thus, p27 deficiency may cause a cell-autonomous defect resulting in enhanced proliferation in response to mitogens. In the spleen, the absence of p27 selectively enhanced proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. p27 deletion, like deletion of the Rb gene, uniquely caused neoplastic growth of the pituitary pars intermedia, suggesting that p27 and Rb function in the same regulatory pathway.

8616888,1996,Cell,Tsg101: a novel tumor susceptibility gene isolated by controlled homozygous functional knockout of allelic loci in mammalian cells.,"Using a novel strategy that enables the isolation of previously unknown genes encoding selectable recessive phenotypes, we identified a gene (tsg101) whose homozygous functional disruption produces cell transformation. Antisense RNA from a transactivated promoter introduced randomly into transcribed genes throughout the genome of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts was used to knock out alleles of chromosomal genes adjacent to promoter inserts, generating clones that grew in 0.5% agar and formed metastatic tumors in nude mice. Removal of the transactivator restored normal growth. The protein encoded by tsg101 cDNA encodes a coiled-coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated previously in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of tsg101 antisense transcripts in naive 3T3 cells resulted in cell transformation and increased stathmin-specific mRNA.","Li, L;Cohen, S N"

Small cell lung tumors (80%) and non-small cell lung cancers (40%) showed abnormalities in RNA transcripts of FHIT, and 76% of the tumors exhibited loss of FHIT alleles.

7585946,1995,Cell,A dominant mutation in the Ikaros gene leads to rapid development of leukemia and lymphoma.,"The Ikaros gene is essential for lymphoid lineage specification. As previously reported, mice homozygous for a mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain fail to generate mature lymphocytes as well as their earliest described progenitors. In addition, our studies with mice heterozygous for this mutation establish the Ikaros gene as an essential regulator of T cell proliferation. Thymocytes display augmented TCR-mediated proliferative responses, and peripheral T cells are autoproliferative. A general lymphoproliferation precedes the T cell leukemia and lymphoma that rapidly develop in all heterozygotes. The first step toward leukemic transformation occurs within the maturing thymocyte population and is demarcated by clonal expansions and loss of the single Ikaros wild-type allele. From these studies, we propose that within developing and mature T lymphocytes, distinct thresholds of Ikaros activity are required to regulate proliferation. A decrease in Ikaros activity below the first threshold causes the rapid accumulation of T lymphoblasts, whereas a further decrease leads to neoplastic transformation.","Winandy, S;Wu, P;Georgopoulos, K"

Despite a loss of fibroblast transformation activity, all three mutants retain the ability to render hematopoietic cell lines growth factor independent and transform primary bone marrow cells in vitro. In vivo tests of malignant potential reveal a most critical role for signals dependent on the BCR-ABL SH2 domain. The efficiency of both fibroblast and hematopoietic transformation by BCR-ABL is strongly affected by increased dosage of the SHC adapter protein, which can connect tyrosine kinase signals to RAS.

Upon treatment with a tumor promoter, c-fos knockout mice carrying a v-H-ras transgene were able to develop benign tumors with similar kinetics and relative incidence as wild-type animals. However, c-fos-deficient papillomas quickly became very dry and hyperkeratinized, taking on an elongated, horny appearance. While wild-type papillomas eventually progressed into malignant tumors, c-fos-deficient tumors failed to undergo malignant conversion. Experiments in which v-H-ras-expressing keratinocytes were grafted onto nude mice suggest that c-fos-deficient cells have an intrinsic defect that hinders tumorigenesis.

Moreover, in these cells, homologous recombination has lost dependence on complete identity between interacting DNA sequences, suggesting that Msh2 is involved in safeguarding the genome from promiscuous recombination. Msh2-deficient mice display no major abnormalities, but a significant fraction develops lymphomas at an early age. Thus, Msh2 is involved in MMR, controlling several aspects of genome stability; loss of MMR-controlled genome stability predisposes to cancer.","de Wind, N;Dekker, M;Berns, A;Radman, M;te Riele, H"

Transformed colonies arose with a raf and a myc-raf virus. Absence of p53 did not affect their frequency but proved critical for their continued propagation. Colonies of p53-/- cells bearing both myc and raf readily yielded continuous cell lines without apparent requirement for genetic alteration. The lines, mainly of erythroid or myelomonocytic origin, were diploid but highly tumorigenic from their inception. These findings imply that p53 loss contributes directly to immortalization and tumorigenesis, probably by abrogating an intrinsic senescence program.","Metz, T;Harris, A W;Adams, J M"
7541721,1995,Cell,Overexpression of the hyaluronan receptor RHAMM is transforming and is also required for H-ras transformation.,"Overexpression of the RHAMM gene by transfection into fibroblasts is transforming and causes spontaneous metastases in the lung. H-ras-transformed fibrosarcomas transfected with a dominant suppressor mutant of RHAMM exhibit a so-called revertant phenotype and are completely nontumorigenic and nonmetastatic. Conversely, fibroblasts stably expressing low levels of RHAMM as a result of antisense transfection are resistant to ras transformation. Collectively, these results indicate that RHAMM acts downstream of ras. The loss of functional RHAMM ablates signaling within focal adhesions, in particular changes in focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, and as a result these focal adhesions are unable to turn over in response to hyaluronan. These results provide evidence of the oncogenic potential of a novel extracellular matrix receptor and establish a functional link between transformation by ras and signaling within focal adhesions that are required for transformation by this oncogene.","Hall, C L;Yang, B;Yang, X;Zhang, S;Turley, M;Samuel, S;Lange, L A;Wang, C;Curpen, G D;Savani, R C;Greenberg, A H;Turley, E A"

Hence, DNA methyltransferase activity contributes substantially to tumor development in this mouse model of intestinal neoplasia. Our results argue against an oncogenic effect of DNA hypomethylation. Moreover, they are consistent with a role for DNA methyltransferase in the generation of the C to T transitions seen at high frequency in human colorectal tumors.","Laird, P W;Jackson-Grusby, L;Fazeli, A;Dickinson, S L;Jung, W E;Li, E;Weinberg, R A;Jaenisch, R"

This leads to the rapid regression of histologically distinct human tumors transplanted onto the CAM. Induction of angiogenesis by a tumor or cytokine promotes vascular cell entry into the cell cycle and expression of integrin alpha v beta 3. After angiogenesis is initiated, antagonists of this integrin induce apoptosis of the proliferative angiogenic vascular cells, leaving preexisting quiescent blood vessels unaffected. We demonstrate therefore that ligation of integrin alpha v beta 3 is required for the survival and maturation of newly forming blood vessels, an event essential for the proliferation of tumors.","Brooks, P C;Montgomery, A M;Rosenfeld, M;Reisfeld, R A;Hu, T;Klier, G;Cheresh, D A"

Using a large series of p53 mutants, we have demonstrated an excellent correlation between transcriptional activation and growth suppression in p53-null human cells. Not all transcriptionally active mutants retain the ability to suppress transformation in primary rodent cells, however, and two tumor-derived point mutants displayed some evidence of both transforming and transactivating activity. Transformation by these mutants was not mediated by transdominant repression of endogenous p53 transactivating function, and cell lines expressing these p53 proteins showed elevated p53 transcriptional activity.

In our animal model, a primary tumor inhibits its remote metastases. After tumor removal, metastases neovascularize and grow. When the primary tumor is present, metastatic growth is suppressed by a circulating angiogenesis inhibitor. Serum and urine from tumor-bearing mice, but not from controls, specifically inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. The activity copurifies with a 38 kDa plasminogen fragment that we have sequenced and named angiostatin. A corresponding fragment of human plasminogen has similar activity. Systemic administration of angiostatin, but not intact plasminogen, potently blocks neovascularization and growth of metastases.

8069917,1994,Cell,p53-dependent apoptosis suppresses tumor growth and progression in vivo.,"To determine the contribution of p53 loss to tumor progression, we have induced abnormal proliferation in the brain choroid plexus epithelium of transgenic mice using a SV40 T antigen fragment that perturbs pRB family function but does not affect p53 function. Tumors induced by this mutant develop slowly compared with those induced by wild-type T antigen. Suppressed tumor growth is directly attributable to p53 function, since rapid tumor development occurs when the T antigen fragment is expressed in p53-null mice. In p53-heterozygous mice, stochastic loss of the wild-type p53 allele results in the focal emergence of aggressive tumor nodules characteristic of tumor progression. In each case, aggressive tumor development in the absence of p53 function corresponds to a decrease in the level of apoptosis. These results provide in vivo evidence that p53-dependent apoptosis, occurring in response to oncogenic events, is a critical regulator of tumorigenesis.","Symonds, H;Krall, L;Remington, L;Saenz-Robles, M;Lowe, S;Jacks, T;Van Dyke, T"

Here we report that embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1-/- mice) can be transformed by expression of an activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. This property is not observed in EFs from wild-type or IRF-2-/- mice but is still observed in EFs from mice deficient in both genes. The transformed phenotype of ras-expressing IRF-1-/- EFs could be suppressed by the expression of the IRF-1 cDNA. Thus, IRF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, expression of the c-Ha-ras oncogene causes wild-type but not IRF-1-/- EFs to undergo apoptosis when combined with a block to cell proliferation or treated by anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation. Hence, IRF-1 may be a critical determinant of oncogene-induced cell transformation or apoptosis.","Tanaka, N;Ishihara, M;Kitagawa, M;Harada, H;Kimura, T;Matsuyama, T;Lamphier, M S;Aizawa, S;Mak, T W;Taniguchi, T"

To investigate these questions, we generated constitutively activated and interfering mutants of MAP kinase kinase 1. The activated mutants stimulated PC12 cell neuronal differentiation and transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The interfering mutants inhibited growth factor-induced PC12 differentiation, growth factor stimulation of proliferation, and reverted v-src- and ras-transformed cells.

Expression of alpha 4 beta 1 promoted homotypic intercellular adhesion. The homotypic adhesion was abrogated, and the alpha 4+ beta 1+ (less invasive cell lines) increased matrigel invasion following the anti-alpha 4 MAb treatment.

Mutation of the two tyrosines results in loss of biological function, as shown by abrogation of the transforming activity in the oncogenic counterpart of the receptor.

The involvement of RAR alpha is particularly intriguing in view of the efficient therapeutic effect of retinoic acid (RA) in this disease. In this report, we show that PML is specifically localized within a discrete subnuclear compartment corresponding to nuclear bodies recognized by patient autoimmune sera. In APL cells, the PML-RAR alpha hybrid displays an abnormal localization and directs RXR and other nuclear antigens into aberrant structures that are tightly bound to chromatin. This suggests that the hybrid could exert a dominant negative effect by diverting a subset of proteins from their natural sites of action. Interestingly, treatment of APL cells with RA induces a complete relocalization of each of these proteins. We propose that the beneficial role of RA in promoting myeloid differentiation in APL might be related to its ability to restore a normal subnuclear organization.","Weis, K;Rambaud, S;Lavau, C;Jansen, J;Carvalho, T;Carmo-Fonseca, M;Lamond, A;Dejean, A"

Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that PML is a part of a novel macromolecular organelle (including at least three other nuclear proteins) referred to as PML oncogenic domains (PODs). In APL cells, the POD is disrupted into a microparticulate pattern as a consequence of the expression of the PML-RAR oncoprotein. RA treatment of APL cells triggers a reorganization of PML to generate normal-appearing PODs. We propose that PML-RAR is a dominant negative oncoprotein that exerts its putative leukomogenic effect by inhibiting assembly of the POD. According to this proposal, not only is the POD a novel structure, but it can be ascribed an imputed function such that its disruption leads to altered myeloid maturation; this may represent a novel oncogenic target.","Dyck, J A;Maul, G G;Miller, W H;Chen, J D;Kakizuka, A;Evans, R M"

The 5.5 kb TSC2 transcript is widely expressed, and its protein product, tuberin, has a region of homology to the GTPase-activating protein GAP3.",
8261515,1993,Cell,Mutations of a mutS homolog in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.,"Recent studies have shown that a locus responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is on chromosome 2p and that tumors developing in these patients contain alterations in microsatellite sequences (RER+ phenotype). We have used chromosome microdissection to obtain highly polymorphic markers from chromosome 2p16. These and other markers were ordered in a panel of somatic cell hybrids and used to define a 0.8 Mb interval containing the HNPCC locus. Candidate genes were then mapped, and one was found to lie within the 0.8 Mb interval. We identified this candidate by virtue of its homology to mutS mismatch repair genes. cDNA clones were obtained and the sequence used to detect germline mutations, including those producing termination codons, in HNPCC kindreds. Somatic as well as germline mutations of the gene were identified in RER+ tumor cells. This mutS homolog is therefore likely to be responsible for HNPCC.","Leach, F S;Nicolaides, N C;Papadopoulos, N;Liu, B;Jen, J;Parsons, R;Peltomäki, P;Sistonen, P;Aaltonen, L A;Nyström-Lahti, M"
7505203,1993,Cell,Tumor suppression by RNA from the 3' untranslated region of alpha-tropomyosin.,"NMU2, a nondifferentiating mutant myogenic cell line, gives rise to rhabdomyosarcomas in mice. We show that constitutive expression of RNA from 0.2 kb of the alpha-tropomyosin (Tm) 3' untranslated region (UTR), but not control 3'UTRs, suppresses anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation by NMU2 cells. When beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-labeled cells were implanted into muscles of adult mouse hindlimbs, Tm 3'UTR expression suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and destruction of muscle tissues characteristic of NMU2. In the rare tumors that developed from Tm 3'UTR transfectants, RNA expression was extinguished. These results suggest that suppression of tumorigenicity is dependent on the continued expression of Tm transcripts lacking a coding region. We conclude that untranslated RNAs can function as regulators (riboregulators) that suppress tumor formation.","Rastinejad, F;Conboy, M J;Rando, T A;Blau, H M"
8252631,1993,Cell,Restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of APC mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli patients.,"In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations.","Olschwang, S;Tiret, A;Laurent-Puig, P;Muleris, M;Parc, R;Thomas, G"

The mutant alleles responsible for this attenuated phenotype have been mapped in several families to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) locus on human chromosome 5q. Four distinct mutations in the APC gene have now been identified in seven AAPC families. These mutations that predict truncation products, either by single base pair changes or frameshifts, are similar to mutations identified in families with classical APC. However, they differ in that the four mutated sites are located very close to one another and nearer the 5' end of the APC gene than any base substitutions or small deletions yet discovered in patients with classical APC.","Spirio, L;Olschwang, S;Groden, J;Robertson, M;Samowitz, W;Joslyn, G;Gelbert, L;Thliveris, A;Carlson, M;Otterud, B"

Expression of hMSH2 in E. coli causes a dominant mutator phenotype, suggesting that hMSH2, like other divergent MutS homologs, interferes with the normal bacterial mismatch repair pathway. hMSH2 maps to human chromosome 2p22-21 near a locus implicated in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). A T to C transition mutation has been detected in the -6 position of a splice acceptor site in sporadic colon tumors and in affected individuals of two small HNPCC kindreds.

The Multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse provides an excellent model for familial colon cancer: it carries a mutant mouse Apc gene and develops many intestinal adenomas. Here, we analyze how this tumor phenotype is dramatically modified by genetic background. We report the genetic mapping of a locus that strongly modifies tumor number in Min/+ animals. This gene, Mom-1 (Modifier of Min-1), maps to distal chromosome 4 and controls about 50% of genetic variation in tumor number in two intraspecific backcrosses. The mapping is supported by a LOD score exceeding 14. Interestingly, Mom-1 lies in a region of synteny conservation with human chromosome 1p35-36, a region of frequent somatic loss of heterozygosity in a variety of human tumors, including colon tumors.

8402896,1993,Cell,BCR-ABL-induced oncogenesis is mediated by direct interaction with the SH2 domain of the GRB-2 adaptor protein.,"BCR-ABL is a chimeric oncoprotein that exhibits deregulated tyrosine kinase activity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive human leukemias. Sequences within the first exon of BCR are required to activate the transforming potential of BCR-ABL. The SH2/SH3 domain-containing GRB-2 protein links tyrosine kinases to Ras signaling. We demonstrate that BCR-ABL exists in a complex with GRB-2 in vivo. Binding of GRB-2 to BCR-ABL is mediated by the direct interaction of the GRB-2 SH2 domain with a phosphorylated tyrosine, Y177, within the BCR first exon. The BCR-ABL-GRB-2 interaction is required for activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Mutation of Y177 to phenylalanine (Y177F) abolishes GRB-2 binding and abrogates BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation. The BCR-ABL (Y177F) mutant is unable to transform primary bone marrow cultures and is impaired in its ability to transform Rat1 fibroblasts. These findings implicate activation of Ras function as an important component in BCR-ABL-mediated transformation and demonstrate that GRB-2 not only functions in normal development and mitogenesis but also plays a role in oncogenesis.","Pendergast, A M;Quilliam, L A;Cripe, L D;Bassing, C H;Dai, Z;Li, N;Batzer, A;Rabun, K M;Der, C J;Schlessinger, J"

The number, size, and growth rate of benign papillomas were not increased in the p53 heterozygous mice in comparison with wild type. The p53 null mice showed a reduced yield of papillomas, but these underwent much more rapid malignant progression, with some poorly differentiated carcinomas developing after only 10 weeks of promotion. Progression rate was also greater in heterozygous than in wild-type mice and was associated with loss of the remaining wild-type allele. Most tumors from all groups had activating mutations in the H-ras gene. Absence of p53, therefore, does not augment the frequency of initiation or the rate of promotion but greatly enhances malignant progression.","Kemp, C J;Donehower, L A;Bradley, A;Balmain, A"

All animals died before 5 months of age with lymphomas that demonstrated phenotypes consistent with transitional intermediate thymocytes (CD4+/CD8+/CD3med). E2A-PBX1 also markedly altered lymphoid development in pretumorous animals, reducing the number of thymocytes and bone marrow B lineage progenitors to 20% of normal levels. In spite of the observed reductions in lymphoid cells, premalignant animals contained significantly increased numbers of cycling thymocytes, but a higher proportion was also undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that increased cell death resulted in the marked lymphopenias. These data indicate that the chimeric homeodomain protein E2A-PBX1 paradoxically induces both proliferation and apoptosis in lymphoid cells, suggesting an in vivo association between nuclear oncogene-induced cell cycle progression and programed cell death.","Dedera, D A;Waller, E K;LeBrun, D P;Sen-Majumdar, A;Stevens, M E;Barsh, G S;Cleary, M L"

We show here that transmission of an infectious MMTV is prevented when superantigen-reactive cells are absent through either clonal deletion due to the expression of an endogenous MTV with identical superantigen specificity or exclusion due to expression of a transgenic TCR beta chain that does not interact with the viral superantigen. A strict requirement for superantigen-reactive T cells is also seen for a local immune response following MMTV infection. This immune response locally amplifies the number of MMTV-infected B cells, most likely owing to their clonal expansion. Collectively, our data indicate that a superantigen-induced immune response is critical for the MMTV life cycle.","Held, W;Waanders, G A;Shakhov, A N;Scarpellino, L;Acha-Orbea, H;MacDonald, H R"

8425220,1993,Cell,Oncogenic activity of the c-Myc protein requires dimerization with Max.,"c-Myc (Myc) and Max proteins dimerize and bind DNA through basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper motifs (b-HLH-LZ). Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that binding to Max is essential for Myc transforming activity and that Myc homodimers are inactive. Mutants of Myc and Max that bind efficiently to each other but not to their wild-type partners were generated by either exchanging the HLH-LZ domains or reciprocally modifying LZ dimerization specificities. While transformation defective on their own, complementary mutants restore Myc transforming activity when coexpressed in cells. The HLH-LZ exchange mutants also have dominant negative activity on wild-type Myc function. In addition, wild-type max antagonizes myc function in a dose-dependent manner, presumably through competition of Max-Max and Myc-Max dimers for common target DNA sites. Therefore, Max can function as both suppressor and activator of Myc. A general model for the role of Myc and Max in growth control is discussed.","Amati, B;Brooks, M W;Levy, N;Littlewood, T D;Evan, G I;Land, H"

We have studied the effects of B7 on antitumor immunity to a murine melanoma that expresses a rejection antigen associated with the E7 gene product of human papillomavirus 16. While this E7+ tumor grows progressively in immunocompetent hosts, cotransfection of its cells with B7 led to tumor regression by a B7-dependent immune response mediated by CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes. The immune response induced by E7+B7+ tumor cells also caused regression of E7+B7- tumors at distant sites and was curative for established E7+B7- micrometastases. Our findings suggest that increasing T cell costimulation through the CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors may have therapeutic usefulness for generating immunity against tumors expressing viral antigens.","Chen, L;Ashe, S;Brady, W A;Hellström, I;Hellström, K E;Ledbetter, J A;McGowan, P;Linsley, P S"

The level of total cellular GAP-like activity was reduced in extracts from the tumor line that expresses very little NF1 protein. Introduction of the catalytic region of GAP into this line resulted in morphological reversion and lower in vivo GTP binding by endogenous p21ras.

Eleven sporadic basal cell carcinomas and all 3 hereditary tumors had allelic loss of chromosome 9q31, and all informative kindreds showed tight linkage between the Gorlin syndrome gene and a genetic marker in this region. Loss of heterozygosity at this chromosomal location, particularly in hereditary tumors, implies that the gene is homozygously inactivated and normally functions as a tumor suppressor.

The aberrant PML-RAR fusion product, while typically retinoic acid responsive, displays both cell type- and promoter-specific differences from the wild-type RAR alpha. Because patients with APL can be induced into remission with high dose RA therapy, we propose that the nonliganded PML-RAR protein is a new class of dominant negative oncogene product. Treatment with RA would not only relieve this inhibition, but the activated PML-RAR protein may actually promote myelocyte differentiation.","Kakizuka, A;Miller, W H;Umesono, K;Warrell, R P;Frankel, S R;Murty, V V;Dmitrovsky, E;Evans, R M"
1831692,1991,Cell,"TAN-1, the human homolog of the Drosophila notch gene, is broken by chromosomal translocations in T lymphoblastic neoplasms.","Previously we described joining of DNA in the beta T cell receptor gene to DNA of an uncharacterized locus in a t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) chromosomal translocation from a case of human T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We now show that the locus on chromosome 9 contains a gene highly homologous to the Drosophila gene Notch. Transcripts of the human gene, for which we propose the name TAN-1, and its murine counterpart are present in many normal human fetal and adult mouse tissues, but are most abundant in lymphoid tissues. In t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocations from three cases of T-ALL, the breakpoints occur within 100 bp of an intron in TAN-1, resulting in truncation of TAN-1 transcripts. These observations suggest that TAN-1 may be important for normal lymphocyte function and that alteration of TAN-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of some T cell neoplasms.","Ellisen, L W;Bird, J;West, D C;Soreng, A L;Reynolds, T C;Smith, S D;Sklar, J"
1652369,1991,Cell,The PML-RAR alpha fusion mRNA generated by the t(15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia encodes a functionally altered RAR.,"We have previously shown that the t(15;17) translocation specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus to an as yet unknown gene, initially called myl and now renamed PML. We report here that this gene product contains a novel zinc finger motif common to several DNA-binding proteins. The PML-RAR alpha mRNA encodes a predicted 106 kd chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences fused to a large part of RAR alpha, including its DNA- and hormone-binding domains. In transient expression assays, the hybrid protein exhibits altered transactivating properties if compared with the wild-type RAR alpha progenitor. Identical PML-RAR alpha fusion points are found in several patients. These observations suggest that in APL, the t(15;17) translocation generates an RAR mutant that could contribute to leukemogenesis through interference with promyelocytic differentiation.","de Thé, H;Lavau, C;Marchio, A;Chomienne, C;Degos, L;Dejean, A"

Three candidate genes located within the deleted region were ascertained and a previous candidate gene, MCC, was shown to be located outside the deleted region. One of the new genes contained sequence identical to SRP19, the gene coding for the 19 kd component of the ribosomal signal recognition particle. The second, provisionally designated DP1 (deleted in polyposis 1), was found to be transcribed in the same orientation as MCC. Two other cDNAs, DP2 and DP3, were found to overlap, forming a single gene, DP2.5, that is transcribed in the same orientation as SRP19.","Joslyn, G;Carlson, M;Thliveris, A;Albertsen, H;Gelbert, L;Samowitz, W;Groden, J;Stevens, J;Spirio, L;Robertson, M"

The intron-exon boundary sequences were defined for each of these genes, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons from DP2.5 identified four mutations specific to APC patients. Each of two aberrant alleles contained a base substitution changing an amino acid to a stop codon in the predicted peptide; the other mutations were small deletions leading to frameshifts. Analysis of DNA from parents of one of these patients showed that his 2 bp deletion is a new mutation; furthermore, the mutation was transmitted to two of his children. These data have established that DP2.5 is the APC gene.","Groden, J;Thliveris, A;Samowitz, W;Carlson, M;Gelbert, L;Albertsen, H;Joslyn, G;Stevens, J;Spirio, L;Robertson, M"
2070421,1991,Cell,Fusion of the nuclear oncoproteins v-Myb and v-Ets is required for the leukemogenicity of E26 virus.,"The highly leukemogenic avian retrovirus E26 expresses the two transcriptional activator-type oncogenes v-myb and v-ets as a nuclear fusion protein. Previous studies have shown that both oncogenes cooperate in the transformation of erythroid cells in vitro and that the phenotypes of transformed cells differ, depending on whether the oncogenes are coexpressed as separate proteins or as a fusion protein. Here we show that virus constructs encoding either v-Myb or v-Ets as their only oncoprotein are nonleukemogenic and that constructs coexpressing nonfused v-Myb and v-Ets proteins appear to be weakly leukemogenic. Surprisingly, leukemic animals injected with the latter contain highly leukemogenic variant viruses that exhibit internal deletions in their genome, resulting in the synthesis of novel Myb-Ets fusion proteins. These results show that v-Myb and v-Ets must be fused to cause leukemia and establish a new mechanism of oncogene activation and cooperation.","Metz, T;Graf, T"
2070412,1991,Cell,Genetic manipulation of E-cadherin expression by epithelial tumor cells reveals an invasion suppressor role.,"A cDNA encoding the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was transfected into highly invasive epithelial tumor cell lines of dog kidney or mouse mammary gland origin. Transfectants with a homogeneously high expression of E-cadherin showed a reproducible loss of activity in two types of in vitro invasion assays. Invasiveness of these transfectants could be reinduced specifically by treatment with anti-E-cadherin antibodies. In vivo, they formed partly differentiated tumors, instead of fully undifferentiated tumors. Alternatively, a plasmid encoding E-cadherin-specific anti-sense RNA was introduced into noninvasive ras-transformed cells with high endogenous E-cadherin expression. The resulting down-regulation, albeit partial, rendered the cells invasive. These data provide direct evidence that E-cadherin acts as an invasion suppressor molecule.","Vleminckx, K;Vakaet, L;Mareel, M;Fiers, W;van Roy, F"
1712671,1991,Cell,BCR sequences essential for transformation by the BCR-ABL oncogene bind to the ABL SH2 regulatory domain in a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent manner.,BCR-ABL is a chimeric oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive human leukemias. BCR first exon sequences specifically activate the tyrosine kinase and transforming potential of BCR-ABL. We have tested the hypothesis that activation of BCR-ABL may involve direct interaction between BCR sequences and the tyrosine kinase regulatory domains of ABL. Full-length c-BCR as well as BCR sequences retained in BCR-ABL bind specifically to the SH2 domain of ABL. The binding domain has been localized within the first exon of BCR and consists of at least two SH2-binding sites. This domain is essential for BCR-ABL-mediated transformation. Phosphoserine/phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine residues on BCR are required for interaction with the ABL SH2 domain. These findings extend the range of potential SH2-protein interactions in growth control pathways and suggest a function for SH2 domains in the activation of the BCR-ABL oncogene as well as a role for BCR in cellular signaling pathways.,"Pendergast, A M;Muller, A J;Havlik, M H;Maru, Y;Witte, O N"
1904009,1991,Cell,Novel zinc finger gene implicated as myc collaborator by retrovirally accelerated lymphomagenesis in E mu-myc transgenic mice.,"To search for genes that can collaborate with myc in lymphomagenesis, we exploited retroviral insertional mutagenesis in E mu-myc transgenic mice. Moloney murine leukemia virus accelerated development of B lymphoid tumors. Three quarters contained a provirus within the known pim-1 or pim-2 loci, new loci bmi-1 and emi-1, or combinations of these. bmi-1 insertions predominated, occurring in half the tumors, and resulted in elevated bmi-1 mRNA levels. Significantly, the bmi-1 gene, which is expressed in diverse normal cells, encodes a Cys/His metal-binding motif (C3HC4) that resembles those in several DNA-binding proteins and defines a new category of zinc finger gene. Thus, myc-induced lymphomagenesis can entail the concerted action of several genes, including the presumptive nuclear regulator bmi-1.","Haupt, Y;Alexander, W S;Barri, G;Klinken, S P;Adams, J M"
1904008,1991,Cell,Identification of cooperating oncogenes in E mu-myc transgenic mice by provirus tagging.,"Mo-MLV infection of E mu-myc transgenic mice results in a dramatic acceleration of pre-B cell lymphomagenesis. We have used provirus tagging to identify genes that cooperate with the E mu-myc transgene in B cell transformation. Here we report on the identification of four loci, pim-1, bmi-1, pal-1, and bla-1, which are occupied by proviruses in 35%, 35%, 28%, and 14% of the tumors, respectively. bmi-1, pal-1, and bla-1 represent novel common proviral insertion sites. The bmi-1 gene encodes a 324 amino acid protein with a predominantly nuclear localization. bmi-1 is highly conserved in evolution and contains several motifs frequently found in transcriptional regulators, including a new putative zinc finger motif. No genes have yet been assigned to pal-1 and bla-1. The distribution of proviruses over the four common insertion sites suggests that provirus tagging can be used not only to identify the cooperating oncogenes but also to assign these genes to distinct complementation groups in tumorigenesis.","van Lohuizen, M;Verbeek, S;Scheijen, B;Wientjens, E;van der Gulden, H;Berns, A"
1840505,1991,Cell,"Association of Myn, the murine homolog of max, with c-Myc stimulates methylation-sensitive DNA binding and ras cotransformation.","Myn, a novel murine approximately 18 kd basic/helix-loop-helix/""leucine zipper"" (B/HLH/LZ) protein, forms a specific DNA-binding complex with the c-Myc oncoprotein through the HLH/LZ motif in both proteins. c-Myc/Myn recognizes a c-Myc-binding site (GACCACGTGGTC) with higher affinity than either protein by itself. CpG methylation of the recognition site greatly inhibits DNA binding, suggesting that DNA methylation may regulate the c-Myc/Myn complex in vivo. In 3T3 fibroblasts, Myn mRNA levels are induced several-fold by serum with delayed early kinetics, suggesting regulation by immediate-early gene products. Coexpression of Myn in a myc/ras rat embryo fibroblast focus formation assay specifically augmented c-myc transforming activity. We suggest that interaction of Myn with c-Myc stabilizes sequence-specific DNA binding in vivo.","Prendergast, G C;Lawe, D;Ziff, E B"
1849798,1991,Cell,Adenovirus inhibition of cellular protein synthesis involves inactivation of cap-binding protein.,"Adenovirus (Ad) infection results in a marked inhibition of cellular protein synthesis that initiates during the late phase of the viral infectious cycle. We show that the mechanism used for suppression of cellular protein synthesis during cell cycle progression is exploited by Ad to repress host and enhance late viral mRNA translation. Discrimination between cellular and late Ad mRNAs and inhibition of host protein synthesis are shown to involve viral-mediated underphosphorylation of cap-binding protein (CBP) and subsequent inactivation of CBP complex, a large enzymatic complex required for cap-dependent mRNA translation. Late Ad mRNAs, like those of poliovirus, possess the unique ability to translate independent of a normal cap recognition process and do not require the activity of CBP complex. Inhibition of cellular translation by these two viruses is quite similar, except that whereas CBP complex is proteolytically degraded by poliovirus, it is functionally inactivated by Ad.","Huang, J T;Schneider, R J"

To investigate the functional effects of nm23 expression, we have transfected a constitutive murine nm23-1 expression construct into highly metastatic K-1735 TK murine melanoma cells. TK clones expressing the exogenous nm23-1 construct exhibited a reduced incidence of primary tumor formation, significant reductions in tumor metastatic potential independent of tumor cell growth, and altered responses to the cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 in soft agar colonization assays, compared with control-transfected TK clones. In contrast, nm23-1-transfected TK clones exhibited no significant differences in intrinsic tumor cell growth, i.e., primary tumor size in vivo, anchorage-dependent growth rate in vitro, and anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar in vitro. The data demonstrate a suppressive effect of nm23 on several aspects of the cancer process, including tumor metastasis.","Leone, A;Flatow, U;King, C R;Sandeen, M A;Margulies, I M;Liotta, L A;Steeg, P S"

In one of the clones, pMeta-1, the epitope marks an additional extracellular domain of 162 amino acids inserted into the rat CD44 protein between amino acid positions 223 and 247 (by analogy to human and murine CD44). The new variants are expressed only in the metastasizing cell lines of two rat tumors, the pancreatic carcinoma BSp73 and the mammary adenocarcinoma 13762NF; they are not expressed in the non-metastasizing tumor cell lines nor in most normal rat tissues. Overexpression of pMeta-1 in the nonmetastasizing BSp73AS cells suffices to establish full metastatic behavior.","Günthert, U;Hofmann, M;Rudy, W;Reber, S;Zöller, M;Haussmann, I;Matzku, S;Wenzel, A;Ponta, H;Herrlich, P"
1988148,1991,Cell,"Growth factors in development, transformation, and tumorigenesis.","Mammalian tissue development and regeneration take place within a milieu of regulatory growth factors. These affect many parameters of cell development, such that survival, proliferation, differentiation, and certain aspects of cell behavior are all influenced by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. The precise effect of any given factor is determined by the responding cell type, the concentration of factor, and the presence of other stimuli, such that some growth factors may fulfill a variety of functions under different circumstances. Classically, growth factor stimuli are transmitted into the cell via activation of specific, transmembrane receptors that modify key regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm. These in turn affect the decisions controlling proliferation and differentiation, including changes in gene expression and reactivity to other factors. There are indications that some factors may function both extra- and intracellularly and that this characteristic is correlated with potential oncogenicity. The relatively low transforming ability of extracellular factors alone is probably attributable to the limitations imposed by down-regulation of their cell surface receptors. Aberrant production of secreted growth factors can, however, play decisive roles in tumorigenesis by increasing the proliferation rate and degree of cellular autonomy and extending the area available for tumor expansion.","Cross, M;Dexter, T M"
2261644,1990,Cell,Mutations in v-myb alter the differentiation of myelomonocytic cells transformed by the oncogene.,"Chick myelomonocytic cells transformed by the v-myb oncogene-containing viruses E26 and AMV differ in that the former resemble myeloblasts and express the v-myb-regulated granulocyte-specific mim-1 gene, while the latter resemble monoblasts and are mim-1 negative. We constructed a series of AMV-E26 chimeras and localized the critical differences between these viruses to three point mutations within the second repeat of the v-myb DNA binding domain. These three positions are altered in the v-myb protein of AMV relative to the proteins encoded by c-myb or E26 v-myb. Back mutating AMV v-myb at any of these three sites restored the oncogene's ability to activate the mim-1 gene. Surprisingly, two of these changes led to the transformation, in vitro and in vivo, of cells having a promyelocyte-like phenotype. These results indicate that different forms of v-myb impose alternate phenotypes of differentiation on transformed myeloid cells, probably by regulating unique sets of differentiation-specific genes.","Introna, M;Golay, J;Frampton, J;Nakano, T;Ness, S A;Graf, T"

The MPLV env region could encode an env-mpl fusion polypeptide that presents the characteristics of a transmembrane protein. We show that in vitro infection of bone marrow cells with helper-free MPLV readily yields immortalized factor-independent hematopoietic cell lines of different lineages. In mice, the c-mpl proto-oncogene is expressed in hematopoietic tissues as a 3 kb mRNA. Since v-mpl shares strong structural analogies with the hematopoietin receptor superfamily, it is likely that MPLV has transduced a truncated form of an as yet unidentified hematopoietic growth factor receptor.","Souyri, M;Vigon, I;Penciolelli, J F;Heard, J M;Tambourin, P;Wendling, F"

A fragment of NF1 cDNA encoding the GAP-related domain (NF1 GRD) was expressed, immunoaffinity purified, and assayed for effects on N-ras p21 GTPase activity. The GTPase of wild-type ras p21 was stimulated by NF1 GRD, but oncogenic mutants of ras p21 (Asp-12 and Val-12) were unaffected, and the GTPase of an effector mutant (Ala-38) was only weakly stimulated. NF1 GRD also down-regulated RAS function in S. cerevisiae. The affinity of NF1 GRD for ras p21 was estimated to be 250 nM: this is more than 20-fold higher than the affinity of GAP for ras p21. However, its specific activity was about 30 times lower. These kinetic measurements suggest that NF1 may be a significant regulator of ras p21 activity, particularly at low ras p21 concentrations.","Martin, G A;Viskochil, D;Bollag, G;McCabe, P C;Crosier, W J;Haubruck, H;Conroy, L;Clark, R;O'Connell, P;Cawthon, R M"

Using both genetic and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that this homology domain of the NF1 protein interacts with ras proteins. First, expression of this NF1 domain suppressed the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of yeast ira1 and ira2 mutants. Second, this NF1 domain, after purification as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, strongly stimulated the GTPase activity of yeast RAS2 and human H-ras proteins. The GST-NF1 protein, however, did not stimulate the GTPase activity of oncogenic mutant ras proteins, H-rasVal-12 and yeast RAS2Val-19 mutants, or a yeast RAS2 effector mutant. These results establish that this NF1 domain has ras GAP activity similar to that found with IRA2 protein and mammalian GAP, and therefore may also regulate ras function in vivo.","Xu, G F;Lin, B;Tanaka, K;Dunn, D;Wood, D;Gesteland, R;White, R;Weiss, R;Tamanoi, F"

We have shown that Tat potentiates the expression of TAR-containing RNAs, but only when Tat and the TAR-containing RNA are present in the nucleus. We now show that a small change in the TAR loop abolishes nuclear potentiation by Tat. Furthermore, the HIV-1 U3 region induces expression incompetence in mRNA synthesized by this promoter. RNAs of identical structure are, however, translated efficiently when produced from the CMV-IE promoter. The Tat-TAR system appears, therefore, to rescue the expression potential of HIV-1 LTR-directed RNA.","Braddock, M;Thorburn, A M;Chambers, A;Elliott, G D;Anderson, G J;Kingsman, A J;Kingsman, S M"
2167180,1990,Cell,The IN protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus processes the viral DNA ends and accomplishes their integration in vitro.,"Retroviral DNA integration involves a coordinated set of DNA cutting and joining reactions.

IN protein has a site-specific nuclease activity that cleaves 2 nucleotides from the sequence present at the 3' ends of MoMLV DNA made by reverse transcription. This reaction generates the recessed 3' ends that are normal precursors for integration. IN protein also possesses the integration activity that joins these recessed 3' ends of the viral DNA to a staggered cut, made by IN protein, in the target DNA. Short duplex oligonucleotides, corresponding to the ends of MoMLV DNA, serve as the viral DNA substrate for both the cleavage and integration reactions; there are no special requirements for the DNA that acts as the target for integration.

ERCC-3 specifically corrects the excision defect in one of the eight XP complementation groups, XP-B. The sole XP-B patient presents an exceptional conjunction of two rare repair disorders: XP and Cockayne's syndrome.

Furthermore, wt p53 may act as a suppressor gene in human carcinogenesis. We now describe the temperature-sensitive behavior of a particular mutant, p53val135. Like other p53 mutants, it can elicit transformation at 37.5 degrees C. However, at 32.5 degrees C it suppresses transformation, behaving like authentic wt p53. Moreover, the proliferation of transformed cells expressing p53val135 is dramatically inhibited at the permissive temperature. Significantly, the inhibition of both transformation and proliferation is reversible upon temperature upshift. These data demonstrate that the ability of wt p53 to suppress transformation is not due to a general lethal effect, but rather to a reversible growth arrest. p53val135 may prove instrumental for gaining insight into the cellular and molecular properties of wt p53.","Michalovitz, D;Halevy, O;Oren, M"

Papillomas subsequently develop on the skin surface, initially at sites subject to biting or scratching such as the base of the tail or behind the ears. The results suggest that the ""second event"" involved in tumor development in these transgenic animals is the local induction of a mild wounding stimulus.

This evidence suggests that NF1 encodes a cytoplasmic GAP-like protein that may be involved in the control of cell growth by interacting with proteins such as the RAS gene product.

To facilitate identification of imprinted genes, we have derived diploid androgenetic embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. In contrast to normal ES cells, they form tumors composed almost entirely of striated muscle when injected subcutaneously into adult mice. They also form chimeras following blastocyst injection, although many chimeras die at early postnatal stages. Surviving chimeras develop skeletal abnormalities, particularly in the rib cartilage.

Sequencing revealed that one mutant allele contains a T----C transition changing a leucine to a proline; another NF1 allele harbors a C----T transition changing an arginine to a stop codon. These results establish the TBR gene as the NF1 gene and provide a description of a major segment of the gene.","Cawthon, R M;Weiss, R;Xu, G F;Viskochil, D;Culver, M;Stevens, J;Robertson, M;Dunn, D;Gesteland, R;O'Connell, P"
1694727,1990,Cell,Deletions and a translocation interrupt a cloned gene at the neurofibromatosis type 1 locus.,"Three new neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutations have been detected and characterized. Pulsed-field gel and Southern blot analyses reveal the mutations to be deletions of 190, 40, and 11 kb of DNA. The 11 kb deletion does not contain any of the previously characterized genes that lie between two NF1 translocation breakpoints, but it does include a portion of a rodent/human conserved DNA sequence previously shown to span one of the translocation breakpoints. By screening cDNA libraries with the conserved sequence, we identified a number of cDNA clones from the translocation breakpoint region (TBR), one of which hybridizes to an approximately 11 kb mRNA. The TBR gene crosses at least one of the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints found in NF1 patients. Furthermore, the newly characterized NF1 deletions remove internal exons of the TBR gene. Although these mutations might act by compromising regulatory elements affecting some other gene, these findings strongly suggest that the TBR gene is the NF1 gene.","Viskochil, D;Buchberg, A M;Xu, G;Cawthon, R M;Stevens, J;Wolff, R K;Culver, M;Carey, J C;Copeland, N G;Jenkins, N A"
2364430,1990,Cell,"Label-retaining cells reside in the bulge area of pilosebaceous unit: implications for follicular stem cells, hair cycle, and skin carcinogenesis.","Inconsistent with the view that hair follicle stem cells reside in the matrix area of the hair bulb, we found that label-retaining cells exist exclusively in the bulge area of the mouse hair follicle. The bulge consists of a subpopulation of outer root sheath cells located in the midportion of the follicle at the arrector pili muscle attachment site. Keratinocytes in the bulge area are relatively undifferentiated ultrastructurally. They are normally slow cycling, but can be stimulated to proliferate transiently by TPA. Located in a well-protected and nourished environment, these cells mark the lower end of the ""permanent"" portion of the follicle. Our findings, plus a reevaluation of the literature, suggest that follicular stem cells reside in the bulge region, instead of the lower bulb. This new view provides insights into hair cycle control and the possible involvement of hair follicle stem cells in skin carcinogenesis.","Cotsarelis, G;Sun, T T;Lavker, R M"
2364429,1990,Cell,Cells nonproductively infected with HIV-1 exhibit an aberrant pattern of viral RNA expression: a molecular model for latency.,"U1 and ACH-2 cells are subclones of HIV-1-infected monocyte/macrophage-like and T lymphocyte cell lines, respectively, which express the HIV-1 genome at very low levels. We have examined whether they might provide a model of HIV-1 latency. The patterns of HIV-1-specific RNA expressed in these cells consisted of singly and multiply spliced RNA species, with little or no full-length genomic RNA. Upon stimulation with agents that activate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in these cells, a marked rise in the amount of small mRNAs, encoding the viral regulatory proteins, preceded the increase in the unspliced RNA. Thus, U1 and ACH-2 cells maintain HIV-1 in a state equivalent to the early phase of a lytic infection and, after stimulation, recapitulate the events of a single cycle infection of highly susceptible target cells.","Pomerantz, R J;Trono, D;Feinberg, M B;Baltimore, D"
2163761,1990,Cell,An internal deletion within an 11p13 zinc finger gene contributes to the development of Wilms' tumor.,"We have recently described the isolation of a candidate for the Wilms' tumor susceptibility gene mapping to band p13 of human chromosome 11. This gene, primarily expressed in fetal kidney, appears to encode a DNA binding protein. We now describe a sporadic, unilateral Wilms' tumor in which one allele of this gene contains a 25 bp deletion spanning an exon-intron junction and leading to aberrant mRNA splicing and loss of one of the four zinc finger consensus domains in the protein. The mutation is absent in the affected individual's germline, consistent with the somatic inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. In addition to this intragenic deletion affecting one allele, loss of heterozygosity at loci along the entire chromosome 11 points to an earlier chromosomal nondisjunction and reduplication. We conclude that inactivation of this gene, which we call WT1, is part of a series of events leading to the development of Wilms' tumor.","Haber, D A;Buckler, A J;Glaser, T;Call, K M;Pelletier, J;Sohn, R L;Douglass, E C;Housman, D E"
1973074,1990,Cell,Intermolecular association of the p185neu protein and EGF receptor modulates EGF receptor function.,"We have used cross-linking reagents on cell lines expressing both p185neu and EGFR. The lysates of the cells were precipitated with anti-p185neu or anti-EGFR antibodies. These precipitates included a high molecular weight complex that was identified as an EGFR-p185neu heterodimer. Heterodimerization was found to be induced by exposure to EGR. The EGFR of these cells displayed three affinity states for EGF: low (Kd, approximately 10(-9) M), high (Kd, 10(-9) to 10(-10) M), and very high (Kd, 10(-11) M), as determined by Scatchard analyses. Relatively small levels of EGF had a dramatic biological effect on cells expressing very high affinity EGFR. The very high affinity EGFR disappeared after the cells were treated with anti-p185neu monoclonal antibodies that selectively down-regulated p185neu. EGF and TPA had differential effects on down-modulation of the EGFR in cells that express either one or both species of receptor proteins.","Wada, T;Qian, X L;Greene, M I"
2350785,1990,Cell,TGF alpha overexpression in transgenic mice induces liver neoplasia and abnormal development of the mammary gland and pancreas.,"To define the role of TGF alpha in normal tissue function and in pathogenesis, transgenic mice have been generated bearing a fusion gene consisting of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter and a human TGF alpha cDNA. In these mice, human TGF alpha RNA and protein are abundant in many tissues and TGF alpha is detectable in blood and urine. The effects of TGF alpha overproduction in transgenic mice are pleiotropic and tissue specific. The liver frequently contains multifocal, well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas that express enhanced levels of human TGF alpha RNA. The mammary gland exhibits impeded morphogenetic penetration of epithelial duct cells into the stromal fat pad. The pancreas shows progressive interstitial fibrosis and a florid acinoductular metaplasia, during which acinar cells appear to degranulate, dedifferentiate, and assume characteristics of intercalated or centroacinar duct cells. TGF alpha therefore plays an important role in cellular proliferation, organogenesis, and neoplastic transformation.","Jhappan, C;Stahle, C;Harkins, R N;Fausto, N;Smith, G H;Merlino, G T"
2161707,1990,Cell,Development of mammary hyperplasia and neoplasia in MMTV-TGF alpha transgenic mice.,"To study the role of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) in normal mammary development and mammary neoplasia in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice in which a human TGF alpha cDNA is expressed under the control of the MMTV enhancer/promoter. Overexpression of TGF alpha in the mammary epithelium, as confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, is associated with hyperplasia of alveoli and terminal ducts in virgin female and pregnant transgenic mice. A range of morphologic abnormalities including lobular hyperplasia, cystic hyperplasia, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma is seen in mammary tissue of transgenic females. In contrast, no morphologic abnormalities are seen in transgenic males in spite of TGF alpha overexpression in salivary glands and reproductive organs. TGF alpha can therefore act as an oncogene in vivo and appears to predispose mammary epithelium to neoplasia and carcinoma.","Matsui, Y;Halter, S A;Holt, J T;Hogan, B L;Coffey, R J"
1693546,1990,Cell,"Overexpression of TGF alpha in transgenic mice: induction of epithelial hyperplasia, pancreatic metaplasia, and carcinoma of the breast.","Metallothionein-directed expression of TGF alpha in transgenic mice induced a spectrum of changes in the growth and differentiation of certain adult tissues. First, TGF alpha promoted a uniform epithelial hyperplasia of several organs without otherwise causing major alterations in tissue architecture. Second, in pancreas it promoted proliferation of both acinar cells and fibroblasts and focally altered acinar cell differentiation. The magnitude of this response was proportional to the level of local, tissue-specific TGF alpha expression and was reproduced when expression of TGF alpha was placed under the control of the elastase promoter, implying an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. Third, TGF alpha was oncogenic in vivo. It caused dramatic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the coagulation gland epithelium, which displayed evidence of carcinoma in situ, and in postlactational mammary gland it induced secretory mammary adenocarcinomas. Thus, TGF alpha displays characteristics of both a potent epithelial cell mitogen and an oncogenic protein in vivo.","Sandgren, E P;Luetteke, N C;Palmiter, R D;Brinster, R L;Lee, D C"
2140528,1990,Cell,TGF-beta 1 inhibition of c-myc transcription and growth in keratinocytes is abrogated by viral transforming proteins with pRB binding domains.,"TGF-beta 1 is demonstrated to inhibit skin keratinocyte proliferation when added during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Human foreskin keratinocytes transformed with either HPV-16 or -18 or SV40, however, were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. Since TGF-beta 1 appears to inhibit keratinocyte growth through down-regulation of c-myc, it was hypothesized that these DNA tumor viruses might be modulating the response to TGF-beta 1 via this pathway. Transient expression of proteins HPV-16 E7, adenovirus type 5 E1A, and SV40 large T antigen is demonstrated to block TGF-beta 1 suppression of c-myc transcription. This effect was not observed with DNA tumor virus transforming proteins mutated in their pRB binding domain. These observations indicate that pRB or another protein that interacts with this binding domain mediates TGF-beta 1 regulation of c-myc gene expression and growth inhibition.","Pietenpol, J A;Stein, R W;Moran, E;Yaciuk, P;Schlegel, R;Lyons, R M;Pittelkow, M R;Münger, K;Howley, P M;Moses, H L"
2185890,1990,Cell,Genetic changes in skin tumor progression: correlation between presence of a mutant ras gene and loss of heterozygosity on mouse chromosome 7.,"Initiation of tumorigenesis in mouse skin can be accomplished by mutagenesis of the H-ras gene by treatment with chemical carcinogens. A mouse model system has been developed to study the additional genetic events that take place during tumor progression. Skin carcinomas were induced in F1 hybrid mice exhibiting restriction fragment length polymorphisms at multiple chromosomal loci. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity in such tumors showed that imbalance of alleles on mouse chromosome 7, on which the H-ras gene is located, occurs very frequently in skin carcinomas. The chromosomal alterations detected, which included both nondisjunction and mitotic recombination events, were only seen in tumors that have activated ras genes. We conclude that gross chromosomal alterations that elevate the copy number of mutant H-ras and/or lead to loss of normal H-ras are a consistent feature of mouse skin tumor development.","Bremner, R;Balmain, A"
2180580,1990,Cell,The candidate proto-oncogene bcl-3 is related to genes implicated in cell lineage determination and cell cycle control.,"A gene, bcl-3, is found on chromosome 19 adjacent to the breakpoints in the translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13.1), which occurs in some cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Sequence analysis of the human bcl-3 gene predicts a protein containing seven tandem copies of the SWI6/cdc10 motif. This motif was previously identified in yeast genes that regulate events at the start of the cell cycle and in invertebrate transmembrane proteins involved in cell differentiation pathways. Expression of bcl-3 in normal blood cells increases markedly following mitogenic stimulation, and leukemic cells with the translocation show much greater expression than controls. These results suggest that bcl-3 is a proto-oncogene that may contribute to leukemogenesis when abnormally expressed.","Ohno, H;Takimoto, G;McKeithan, T W"
2155708,1990,Cell,Elevated levels of the alpha 5 beta 1 fibronectin receptor suppress the transformed phenotype of Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"We report here on gene transfer studies designed to investigate the function of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin and its role in transformation. Transfection of the human alpha 5 and beta 1 cDNAs into transformed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells followed by methotrexate-induced amplification yielded clonal cell lines overexpression this fibronectin receptor. The overexpressors deposited more fibronectin in their extracellular matrix and migrated less than control cells. In addition, they showed reduced saturation density and reduced ability to grow in soft agar. The overexpressor cells, unlike the control CHO cells, were nontumorigenic when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The results indicate that extracellular matrix recognition by the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin plays a role in the control of cell proliferation and suggest that a reduction of this fibronectin receptor may be responsible for the acquisition of anchorage independence by transformed cells.","Giancotti, F G;Ruoslahti, E"

Type II (NN = TG) and type III (NN = CG) neither silence nor respond to IRF-1 or IFN. Type III mediates constitutive transcription and binds the constitutive IEFga factor, whereas type II binds the novel ""TG protein"".

We designated this transforming gene PTC (for papillary thyroid carcinoma). Here we describe the molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene. The new oncogene resulted from the rearrangement of an unknown amino-terminal sequence to the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret proto-oncogene. This gene rearrangement was detected in all of the transfectants and in all of the original tumor DNAs, but not in normal DNA of the same patients, thus indicating that this genetic lesion occurred in vivo and is specific to somatic tumors.

1967983,1990,Cell,A new homeobox gene contributes the DNA binding domain of the t(1;19) translocation protein in pre-B ALL.,"It was previously shown that the chromosome 19 breakpoint of the t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation, found in human pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, is within the E2A transcription factor gene on chromosome 19. A cell line with this translocation contains two novel chimeric mRNAs, both with the same 5'E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3' sequence from a previously unrecognized gene dubbed prl, located on chromosome 1. The chimeric RNAs encode a protein that lacks 171 amino acids of E2A, including its DNA binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a homeobox-related sequence from prl. Therefore, the production of a chimeric E2A-Prl protein may contribute to the acute lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes normally responsive to the Prl homeoprotein.","Kamps, M P;Murre, C;Sun, X H;Baltimore, D"
2154335,1990,Cell,Isolation and characterization of a zinc finger polypeptide gene at the human chromosome 11 Wilms' tumor locus.,"We have isolated a series of genomic and cDNA clones mapping within the boundaries of constitutional and tumor deletions that define the Wilms' tumor locus on human chromosome 11 (band p13). The transcription unit corresponding to these clones spans approximately 50 kb and encodes an mRNA approximately 3 kb long. This mRNA is expressed in a limited range of cell types, predominantly in the kidney and a subset of hematopoietic cells. The polypeptide encoded by this locus has a number of features suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation. These include the presence of four zinc finger domains and a region rich in proline and glutamine. The amino acid sequence of the predicted polypeptide shows significant homology to two growth regulated mammalian polypeptides, EGR1 and EGR2. The genetic localization of this gene, its tissue-specific expression, and the function predicted from its sequence lead us to suggest that it represents the 11p13 Wilms' tumor gene.","Call, K M;Glaser, T;Ito, C Y;Buckler, A J;Pelletier, J;Haber, D A;Rose, E A;Kral, A;Yeger, H;Lewis, W H"

Our strategy to construct the map combined the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and irradiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids. These hybrids, which contain limited segments of human chromosome 11 segregated from the remainder of the human genome, permit direct visualization of restriction fragments located in 11p13 using human interspersed repeated DNA sequences as hybridization probes. The physical map has provided a framework to identify the sites of genes responsible for the complex of disorders associated with hemizygous 11p13 deletion: Wilms' tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation. The Wilms' tumor locus has been limited to a region of less than 345 kb, and a transcript with many of the characteristics expected for the Wilms' tumor gene has been localized to this region.","Rose, E A;Glaser, T;Jones, C;Smith, C L;Lewis, W H;Call, K M;Minden, M;Champagne, E;Bonetta, L;Yeger, H"
2154332,1990,Cell,The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product undergoes cell cycle-dependent dephosphorylation and binding to and release from SV40 large T.,"Synchronized monkey cells pulse-labeled with [35S]-methionine and chased for various lengths of time were extracted, and immunoprecipitations were performed using monoclonal antibodies directed against the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and SV40 T antigen (T). By following a discrete population of these two proteins through the cell cycle, the following information was obtained. RB, which is wholly unphosphorylated in G1, became phosphorylated at the beginning of S and remained phosphorylated through S and G2. RB was, then, completely dephosphorylated between the end of G2 and the beginning of G1. Second, while all of the detectable unphosphorylated RB can be found complexed with T, these complexes present during G1 dissociated in S and reformed again in M or early G1. Finally, T molecules appeared to oligomerize prior to binding RB. Thus, complex formation between T and RB may be regulated in part by the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RB and by the quaternary structure of T.","Ludlow, J W;Shon, J;Pipas, J M;Livingston, D M;DeCaprio, J A"
2137372,1990,Cell,Interleukin-2 production by tumor cells bypasses T helper function in the generation of an antitumor response.,"A poorly immunogenic murine colon cancer was used to investigate mechanisms of antitumor immunity. Injection of tumor cells engineered by gene transfection to secrete IL-2 stimulated an MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the parental tumor. The tumor cells secreting IL-2 produced an antitumor response in vivo, even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Animals immunized with the engineered cells were protected against subsequent challenge with the parental tumor cell line. Similar findings were demonstrated for other tumor types. Thus, provision of a helper lymphokine in a paracrine fashion induced a tumor-specific immune response involving activation of endogenous CTLs and other immune effector cells. These findings demonstrate that the failure of an effective antitumor immune response may be primarily due to a helper arm deficiency of the immune system rather than a paucity of tumor-specific cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, they outline a novel strategy for augmenting tumor immunity.","Fearon, E R;Pardoll, D M;Itaya, T;Golumbek, P;Levitsky, H I;Simons, J W;Karasuyama, H;Vogelstein, B;Frost, P"
2598264,1989,Cell,Molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B virus transgenic mice.,"Transgenic mice that overproduce the hepatitis B virus large envelope polypeptide and accumulate toxic quantities of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within the hepatocyte develop severe, prolonged hepatocellular injury that initiates a programmed response within the liver, characterized by inflammation, regenerative hyperplasia, transcriptional deregulation, and aneuploidy. This response inexorably progresses to neoplasia. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in this model corresponds to the frequency, severity, and age of onset of liver cell injury, which itself corresponds to the intrahepatic concentration of HBsAg and is influenced by genetic background and sex. Thus, the inappropriate expression of a single structural viral gene is sufficient to cause malignant transformation in this model. These results suggest that severe, prolonged cellular injury induces a preneoplastic proliferative response that fosters secondary genetic events that program the cell for unrestrained growth.","Chisari, F V;Klopchin, K;Moriyama, T;Pasquinelli, C;Dunsford, H A;Sell, S;Pinkert, C A;Brinster, R L;Palmiter, R D"

Nuclear extracts from infected cells contain an activity that increases processing efficiency specifically at a late herpes simplex virus poly(A) site. By contrast, a second virus poly(A) site is processed with equal efficiency by nuclear extracts from infected and mock-infected cells. Using precursor RNAs containing these two virus poly(A) sites in tandem, which allows ready detection of the processing factor, we show that this specific activity is heat labile. Analysis of RNAs produced by virus recombinants that contain the poly(A) site sequences in tandem also indicates that increased processing at the late virus poly(A) site occurs in vivo.","McLauchlan, J;Simpson, S;Clements, J B"
2513129,1989,Cell,jun-B inhibits and c-fos stimulates the transforming and trans-activating activities of c-jun.,"We have cloned the human jun-B gene and determined its sequence and transforming and trans-activating activities. jun-B is less potent that c-jun in transforming and immortalizing primary rat embryo cells in cooperation with activated ras (effects enhanced by c-fos and TPA); unlike c-jun, jun-B does not transform Rat-1A cells alone. However, cotransfection of c-jun and jun-B into primary rat embryo cells with c-Ha-ras results in a significant decrease in transformation compared with c-jun alone, an event reversed by TPA. Cotransfection of c-jun and jun-B with or without c-fos into F9 teratocarcinoma cells results in decreased trans-activation of AP-1 compared with either gene alone. Introduction of jun-B into primary rat c-jun/ras transformants or c-jun into jun-B/ras transformants also results in a decrease in trans-activation. These findings demonstrate that, whereas jun-B and c-jun each participate in AP-1 trans-activation and malignant transformation, interactions between them involve negative regulation.","Schütte, J;Viallet, J;Nau, M;Segal, S;Fedorko, J;Minna, J"

2553267,1989,Cell,The ski oncogene induces muscle differentiation in quail embryo cells.,"Quail embryo cells (QECs) are primary cultures of fibroblastoid cells that become myogenic after infection with avian retroviruses expressing the ski oncogene (SKVs). ski also stimulates proliferation of QECs and induces morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, ski-transformed clones picked from soft agar are capable of muscle differentiation. ski-induced differentiation is essentially indistinguishable from that of uninfected myoblasts in culture with regard to muscle-specific gene expression, commitment, and inhibition by growth factors or other oncogenes. However, ski-induced myoblasts have less stringent requirements for growth and differentiation. Uninfected QECs cannot differentiate and do not express an early marker for the myogenic lineage. Clonal analysis indicates that at least 40% of QECs are converted by ski to differentiating myoblasts. The data suggest that ski induces either the capacity for differentiation in an ""incompetent"" muscle precursor or the determination of nonmyogenic cells to the myogenic lineage.","Colmenares, C;Stavnezer, E"

We now report that E5 can cooperate with human EGF receptors and with human CSF-1 receptors to induce cellular transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Cooperation occurred in the absence of receptor stimulation by ligand, and it was further augmented by treatment with ligand. Cooperation was not seen between E5 and either c-fes or c-src. The cooperation between E5 and high levels of EGF receptors was associated with inhibition of receptor degradation and persistence of activated receptors on the cell surface.

2477157,1989,Cell,"Spontaneous losses of control of cytokeratin gene expression in transformed, non-epithelial human cells occurring at different levels of regulation.","Intermediate filaments (IFs) of the cytokeratin (CK) type are cytoskeletal elements typical for epithelial differentiation. However, in diverse transformed culture lines of non-epithelial origin, rare cells emerge spontaneously, which synthesize, in addition to their vimentin IFs, CKs 8 and 18. We enriched such cells by cloning and studied the level(s) of regulation at which these changes occur. We found that in SV40-transformed fibroblasts the CK 18 gene is constitutively transcribed into translatable mRNA but that the protein is rapidly degraded in the absence of its complex partner, CK 8. In contrast, cells immunocytochemically positive for CK IFs contained both CKs 8 and 18, which apparently stabilized in heterotypic complexes. These findings and related observations of active genes for CKs 8 and/or 18 in several other transformed non-epithelial cell lines indicate that the genes for CKs 18 and, less frequently, 8 can be active in diverse different non-epithelial cell lines; synthesis of type I and type II CK pair partners can be uncoupled; control of CK IF formation can take place at different levels. We suggest that the intrinsic instability of the inactive state of these genes is responsible for the occurrence of CKs 8 and 18 in certain non-epithelial tissues and tumors, a caveat in tumor diagnosis.","Knapp, A C;Franke, W W"

In experiments designed to explore the potential mechanism of RB tumor suppression, we report here that the phosphorylation state of RB protein is modulated during normal cellular events. In resting cells, RB protein is present in its least phosphorylated form; in rapidly proliferating cells, RB protein is highly phosphorylated. Maximal phosphorylation is associated with S phase of the cell cycle. Induction of differentiation in several human leukemia cell lines by treatment with phorbol ester or retinoic acid leads to dephosphorylation of RB. Time course studies indicate that RB dephosphorylation precedes the total arrest of cell growth during differentiation. These observations strongly suggest that the function of RB protein is modulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism during cell proliferation and differentiation.","Chen, P L;Scully, P;Shew, J Y;Wang, J Y;Lee, W H"

It is a nuclear phosphoprotein hypothesized to act as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation, yet surprisingly it is present in actively dividing cells. To look for changes in p105-RB that may regulate its activity during the cell cycle, we generated synchronized cell populations and followed their progression through the cell cycle. p105-RB is synthesized throughout the cycle, but is phosphorylated in a phase-specific manner. In the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, an unphosphorylated species of the protein is the only detectable form, whereas in the S and G2/M phases, multiple phosphorylated species of p105-RB are detected.","Buchkovich, K;Duffy, L A;Harlow, E"
2673542,1989,Cell,The product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene has properties of a cell cycle regulatory element.,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb, is suspected to suppress cell growth. Rb is a 110-114 kd nuclear phosphoprotein. We have previously demonstrated that SV40 T antigen binds only to unphosphorylated Rb, and not pp112-114Rb, the family of phosphorylated Rb. Here we demonstrate the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Rb. In G0/G1 cells, virtually all the Rb is unphosphorylated. In contrast, during S and G2, it is largely, if not exclusively, phosphorylated. Rb phosphorylation occurs at the G1/S boundary in several cell types tested. A 14 residue peptide, corresponding to the SV40 T domain required for transformation, is able to compete effectively with SV40 T for binding to p110Rb.

Cells transformed with a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus carrying a temperature-sensitive ras allele lose their transformation phenotype when shifted to the nonpermissive (39 degrees C) temperature. The thyroglobulin promoter, however, remains inactive. Similarly, transfection of these cells with a thyroglobulin promoter fused to a neomycin resistance reporter gene does not produce clones resistant to G418. Treatment of the transfected cells with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine reactivates the thyroglobulin promoter and yields stable G418-resistant clones. We show that thyroglobulin promoter activity is correlated with the presence of a thyroid-specific nuclear factor, TgTF1. TgTF1 cannot be detected in transformed cells but reappears after treatment with 5-azacytidine at 39 degrees C. Restoration of Ras activity at 33 degrees C leads to the rapid loss of TgTF1 and G418 resistance.","Avvedimento, E V;Obici, S;Sanchez, M;Gallo, A;Musti, A;Gottesman, M E"
2667764,1989,Cell,Expression of the H-ras proto-oncogene is controlled by alternative splicing.,"We previously demonstrated that a point mutation in the last intron of the human H-ras oncogene causes a significant increase in its expression and transforming efficiency. Here we establish the basis of this phenomenon. Using gene reconstruction experiments, we have identified a negative-acting element in the intron that is completely inactivated by the mutation. The effects of other nucleotide alterations introduced into this region suggested that the negative element might constitute an alternative exon. Transcripts containing this putative exon were identified and S1 nuclease analysis confirmed that the mutation prevents their synthesis. The abundance of these transcripts is low, apparently due to message instability and/or defective processing. The predicted product of the alternative transcript is suggested to lack transforming potential. Our findings demonstrate that alternative splicing normally operates to suppress p21H-ras expression and that this negative control is abolished by a variety of mutations that interfere with this process.","Cohen, J B;Broz, S D;Levinson, A D"
2568888,1989,Cell,Synergistic interaction of p185c-neu and the EGF receptor leads to transformation of rodent fibroblasts.,"The protein product of the rodent neu oncogene, p185neu, is a tyrosine kinase with structural similarity to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Transfection and subsequent overexpression of the human p185c-erbB-2 protein transforms NIH 3T3 cells in vitro. However, NIH 3T3 cells are not transformed by overexpressed rodent p185c-neu. NIH 3T3 transfectants overexpressing EGF receptors are not transformed unless incompletely transformed. Several groups have recently demonstrated EGF-induced, EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of p185c-neu. During efforts to characterize the interaction of p185c-neu with EGFR further, we created cell lines that simultaneously overexpress both p185c-neu and EGFR and observed that these cells become transformed. These observations demonstrate that two distinct, overexpressed tyrosine kinases can act synergistically to transform NIH 3T3 cells, thus identifying a novel mechanism that can lead to transformation.","Kokai, Y;Myers, J N;Wada, T;Brown, V I;LeVea, C M;Davis, J G;Dobashi, K;Greene, M I"
2526683,1989,Cell,"An N-terminal transformation-governing sequence of SV40 large T antigen contributes to the binding of both p110Rb and a second cellular protein, p120.","In addition to Rb and p53, a third cellular protein, p120 in monkey and p118 in human cells, forms a specific complex with SV40 large T antigen (T). p118/120 is not a product of the Rb-gene. As was shown with T/Rb complex formation, the interaction between T and p120 is dependent on the intact nature of a ten residue, transformation-controlling domain in T (residues 105-114). In mouse cells, a readily detectable protein of 115 kd was detected, which, like murine Rb, also forms a stable complex with T. Like p118/120, p115 binding is also dependent on the intact nature of the 105-114 sequence. Given their similar size and T antigen binding sequence dependence, p115 and p118/120 may be products of the same gene in different species. These results suggest that interactions between T and p115/118/120, as well as T and Rb, contribute to the SV40 transforming mechanism.","Ewen, M E;Ludlow, J W;Marsilio, E;DeCaprio, J A;Millikan, R C;Cheng, S H;Paucha, E;Livingston, D M"
2752424,1989,Cell,"lyl-1, a novel gene altered by chromosomal translocation in T cell leukemia, codes for a protein with a helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif.","We have characterized a transcription unit at chromosome band 19p13 that lies at the site of a chromosomal translocation breakpoint in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The lyl-1 gene is structurally altered following a t(7;19) translocation, resulting in its head-to-head juxtaposition with the T cell receptor C beta gene and truncation of lyl-1 RNA. The predicted protein product of the lyl-1 gene contains a potential helix-loop-helix DNA binding motif also found in several proteins involved in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation: all members of the Myc family, MyoD1, myogenin, the Drosophila achaete-scute, twist, and daughterless proteins, and two recently described immunoglobulin enhancer binding proteins. The implication of lyl-1 in cellular transformation suggests that other proteins containing similar DNA binding motifs may also be involved with neoplastic transformation in various cellular lineages.","Mellentin, J D;Smith, S D;Cleary, M L"
2752417,1989,Cell,Interaction with normal cells suppresses the transformed phenotype of v-myc-transformed quail muscle cells.,"We have analyzed mixed cultures of normal mammalian fibroblastic cells and transformed quail myoblasts to investigate whether the presence of an excess of normal cells could suppress the phenotype of transformed quail cells. In such mixed cultures, only v-myc-transformed cells were growth-arrested, whereas v-src-transformed myoblasts were essentially unaffected. Growth arrest appeared to reflect reversion from the transformed state, including re-expression of the myogenic differentiation program. The v-myc-transformed myoblasts were phenotypically corrected also by differentiating normal quail myoblasts, giving rise to hybrid myotubes containing nuclei from both cell types. The differential behavior of transformed cells closely paralleled the efficiency with which they established metabolic cooperation with adjacent normal cells. Our results indicate that unrestrained proliferation associated with transformation is responsible for v-myc-induced block of myogenic differentiation.","La Rocca, S A;Grossi, M;Falcone, G;Alemà, S;Tatò, F"
2568887,1989,Cell,"Expression of the v-erbA product, an altered nuclear hormone receptor, is sufficient to transform erythrocytic cells in vitro.","We investigated the effect of the v-erbA oncogene product, an altered thyroid hormone receptor, in chicken erythrocyte progenitor cells. Bone marrow cells were infected with a retrovirus vector (XJ12) carrying the v-erbA gene in association with the neoR gene. XJ12-infected erythrocyte progenitor cells gave rise to G418-resistant clones. Some were composed of blast cells identified as transformed CFU-Es blocked in their differentiation. These cells could be grown in culture for at least 25 generations and required anemic chicken serum as a source of erythropoietic growth factors. XJ12 can infect erythrocyte progenitor cells in vivo but is not sufficient to induce erythroleukemia. These data suggest that the activation of a nuclear hormone receptor might represent one step toward the development of neoplasms.","Gandrillon, O;Jurdic, P;Pain, B;Desbois, C;Madjar, J J;Moscovici, M G;Moscovici, C;Samarut, J"
2525423,1989,Cell,The p53 proto-oncogene can act as a suppressor of transformation.,"DNA clones of the wild-type p53 proto-oncogene inhibit the ability of E1A plus ras or mutant p53 plus ras-activated oncogenes to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts. The rare clones of transformed foci that result from E1A plus ras plus wild-type p53 triple transfections all contain the p53 DNA in their genome, but the great majority fail to express the p53 protein. The three cell lines derived from such foci that express p53 all produce mutant p53 proteins with properties similar or identical to transformation-activated p53 proteins. The p53 mutants selected in this fashion (transformation in vitro) resemble the p53 mutants selected in tumors (in vivo). These results suggest that the p53 proto-oncogene can act negatively to block transformation.","Finlay, C A;Hinds, P W;Levine, A J"
2736622,1989,Cell,Endothelioma cells expressing the polyoma middle T oncogene induce hemangiomas by host cell recruitment.,"Mouse endothelioma cells expressing the polyoma middle T oncogene induced hemangiomas in a variety of species such as mice, rats, chicks, and quails. In embryos and newborn mice the hemangiomas expanded within 10-18 hr of injection, disrupting the vasculature and causing the death of the animal. In contrast, the hemangiomas formed a stable structure reminiscent of benign human hemangiomas in adult mice within 5 days. Analysis of the cells comprising the hemangioma revealed that over 95% of the endothelial cells were host derived. No induction of host cell proliferation was detected, and no endothelial mitogens were secreted by the endothelioma cells in vitro. The maintenance of the hemangioma appeared to require the continuous presence of endothelioma cells. The results indicate that these endothelioma cells act as a potent stimulating agent in the rapid formation of hemangiomas by recruiting nonproliferating host endothelial cells.","Williams, R L;Risau, W;Zerwes, H G;Drexler, H;Aguzzi, A;Wagner, E F"
2567634,1989,Cell,Stochastic appearance of mammary tumors in transgenic mice carrying the MMTV/c-neu oncogene.,"Transgenic mice carrying the activated c-neu oncogene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat were produced. Epithelial hyperplasia of epididymis, seminal vesicles, and salivary glands, and dysplasia of harderian glands, were induced. Moreover, in females of our four lines, independent but multiple mammary tumors arose asynchronously, between 5 and 10 months of age, as stochastic events. Histologically, poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, with intratumor necrosis and calcifications, arose adjacent to morphologically normal epithelium. High transgene expression was detected in all mammary tumors tested and in normal mammary glands before the appearance of the tumors. Together these results suggest that the expression of the activated c-neu oncogene was necessary but not sufficient to induce malignant transformation of the mammary epithelial cells. These tumors appear to be an adequate model for human breast cancers overexpressing c-neu.","Bouchard, L;Lamarre, L;Tremblay, P J;Jolicoeur, P"
2785856,1989,Cell,Murine interleukin-4 displays potent anti-tumor activity in vivo.,"We have devised a sensitive means to assess the anti-tumor effect of cytokines that act via the mobilization of host-mediated defenses. This assay involves transfecting malignant cells to produce a specific cytokine (in this case, IL-4) and measuring the ability of transfectants to form tumors alone and when mixed with a variety of nontransfected tumor cells. In this way, we have identified a potent, non-cell autonomous, anti-tumor effect of IL-4 which is effective against a wide range of tumor cell types in vivo. The effect is reversed by anti-IL-4 antibody, correlates closely with levels of IL-4 production, and is evident in nu/nu mice. The anti-tumor effect seems to be mediated by an inflammatory infiltrate composed of eosinophils and macrophages.","Tepper, R I;Pattengale, P K;Leder, P"
2467745,1989,Cell,A novel vitronectin receptor integrin (alpha v beta x) is responsible for distinct adhesive properties of carcinoma cells.,"Carcinoma cells express a novel integrin involved in cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not to fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor, whereas melanoma and endothelial cells express a vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) that promotes cell attachment to all of these matrix components. The integrin responsible for this adhesive phenotype of carcinoma cells is composed of an alpha subunit that is indistinguishable from the alpha v of the vitronectin receptor and a beta subunit (beta x) that is distinct from any known integrin beta subunit. Accordingly, Northern blot analysis identifies an mRNA for alpha v, but not for beta 3 in carcinoma cells. This receptor appears to mediate cell adhesion to vitronectin as well as fibronectin since an antibody directed to its alpha subunit blocked carcinoma cell adhesion to both of these matrix proteins. These results suggest that homologous integrins with identical alpha subunits and structurally distinct beta subunits can account for the functional recognition of different matrixes by two cell types.","Cheresh, D A;Smith, J W;Cooper, H M;Quaranta, V"
2538247,1989,Cell,Multistage carcinogenesis induced by ras and myc oncogenes in a reconstituted organ.,"ras and myc oncogenes were able to induce distinct phenotypic alterations, resembling different types of premalignant lesions, when introduced into approximately 0.1% of the cells used to reconstitute the mouse prostate gland. While ras induced dysplasia in combination with angiogenesis, myc induced a hyperplasia of the otherwise normally developed organ. ras and myc together induced primarily carcinomas. However, tumor progression was also associated with additional genetic alterations involving gene amplification. Our data indicate that specific types of benign premalignant lesions may reflect the activation of different single oncogenes, and that the consecutive activation of multiple oncogenes could be a causal event in the step-like progression of tumorigenesis.","Thompson, T C;Southgate, J;Kitchener, G;Land, H"

Between 5% and 10% of the pim-1 transgenic mice develop clonal T cell lymphomas before 7 months of age, whereas none of the age-matched control mice do, providing direct evidence for the oncogenic potential of pim-1. Histological examination and FACS analysis revealed no abnormalities in hematopoietic tissues of disease-free pim-1 transgenic mice. When newborn pim-1 transgenic mice are infected with MuLV, T cell lymphomas develop much faster (latency 7-8 weeks) than in nontransgenic mice (latency 22 weeks). In all these T cell lymphomas either c-myc or N-myc was activated by proviral insertion, suggesting strong cooperation between pim-1 and myc in lymphomagenesis.","van Lohuizen, M;Verbeek, S;Krimpenfort, P;Domen, J;Saris, C;Radaszkiewicz, T;Berns, A"
2464438,1989,Cell,Regulation of the activity of a new inhibitor of angiogenesis by a cancer suppressor gene.,"An inhibitor has been identified in the conditioned medium of hamster cells and hamster-human hybrids that suppresses neovascularization in vivo in the rat cornea. Inhibitory activity was tightly linked to the presence of an active cancer suppressor gene in transformants and revertants, in segregating hybrids, and in temperature-limited transformants. It copurified with a approximately 140 kd glycoprotein. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified preparation recognized a 140 kd protein in conditioned medium and was able to adsorb out all antiangiogenic activity. These results define the control of the activity of an inhibitor of neovascularization as one function of the cancer suppressor gene active in BHK21/cl13 cells and simultaneously identify a new inhibitor of angiogenesis, a process vital to the growth of solid tumors.","Rastinejad, F;Polverini, P J;Bouck, N P"
2521461,1989,Cell,Changes in integrin receptors on oncogenically transformed cells.,"Oncogenically transformed cells show reduced assembly of fibronectin-rich extracellular matrixes and diminished ability to adhere to fibronectin. The molecular bases of these phenotypic alteration are not fully understood. We report here alterations in the spectrum of integrins, including two fibronectin receptors, on oncogenic transformation of rodent cells. Transformation of rat1, NRK, and Nil8 cells by Rous sarcoma virus or by murine sarcoma viruses encoding ras oncogenes leads to reductions in the level of integrin alpha 5 beta 1, which is a well-defined fibronectin receptor, and of two other integrin receptors. In contrast, another receptor, alpha 3 beta 1, which is a polyspecific receptor for fibronectin, laminin, and collagen, is retained by transformed cells. These results provide explanations for earlier results concerning the interactions of extracellular matrix proteins with the surfaces of tumor cells and offer leads to further understanding of the altered adhesive and migratory behavior of malignant cells.","Plantefaber, L C;Hynes, R O"
2910497,1989,Cell,SV40 large T antigen binds preferentially to an underphosphorylated member of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product family.,"Extracts of monkey cells (CV-1P) synthesizing SV40 large T antigen (T) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to T or p110-114Rb, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb). While a family of p110-114Rb proteins can be detected in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates, only one member of this family, p110Rb, was found in anti-T precipitates of these extracts. Identical results were obtained with extracts of CV-1P cells which had been previously mixed in vitro with highly purified T. The p110-114Rb family is composed of two sets--p110Rb, an un- or under-phosphorylated species, and pp112-114Rb, a group of overtly phosphorylated proteins. Thus, T bound preferentially to the un- or underphosphorylated member of the family. In addition, T failed to alter the relative abundances of these species. These results suggest a model in which the growth suppression function of Rb is down modulated either by phosphorylation or T antigen binding.","Ludlow, J W;DeCaprio, J A;Huang, C M;Lee, W H;Paucha, E;Livingston, D M"
2642744,1989,Cell,A ras-related gene with transformation suppressor activity.,"A 1.8 kb cDNA clone, Krev-1, with revertant-inducing activity on Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH/3T3 cells, has been isolated from a human fibroblast cDNA expression library. In Krev-1 transfectants, there is a correlation between the levels of specific mRNA and the degrees of suppression of the transformed phenotype. The cDNA encodes a protein of 21,000 daltons that unexpectedly shares around 50% amino acid identities with ras proteins. The Krev-1 homologs are found in mouse, rat, and chicken DNA, and their transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in many rat organs. Thus, the Krev-1 gene seems to play an important role(s) in a wide variety of tissues, and may be involved in the negative growth regulation of certain cell types.","Kitayama, H;Sugimoto, Y;Matsuzaki, T;Ikawa, Y;Noda, M"

To help determine the functional basis of these interactions, the regions of E1A that participate in these interactions were mapped using a series of deletion mutants. The 300,000 dalton and the 107,000 dalton proteins interacted with sequences within amino acids 1 to 76 and 121 to 127, respectively. Interaction with the third cellular protein, p105-RB, required the presence of sequences from two noncontiguous regions of the E1A polypeptide chain, amino acids 30 to 60 and 121 to 127. The regions of E1A that are required for these interactions coincided precisely with the regions of E1A that are required for its transforming function. These results suggest that the interactions with these cellular proteins are fundamental to the transforming activity of E1A.","Whyte, P;Williamson, N M;Harlow, E"
2974321,1988,Cell,A point mutation in the extracellular domain of the human CSF-1 receptor (c-fms proto-oncogene product) activates its transforming potential.,"A human CSF-1 receptor containing an ""activating"" mutation in its extracellular domain (serine for leucine 301) induced morphologic transformation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in mouse NIH 3T3 cells. A second regulatory mutation within the receptor's intracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail (phenylalanine for tyrosine 969) augmented transforming efficiency but was itself insufficient to induce transformation. Like the v-fms oncogene product, receptors bearing the activating mutation retained high-affinity binding sites for CSF-1 but were retarded in transport to the cell surface and were phosphorylated on tyrosine in the absence of ligand. Although the activating mutation does not affect the CSF-1 binding site in the receptor extracellular domain, it must induce a conformational change that mimics the effect of ligand binding, resulting in CSF-1-independent signals for cell growth.","Roussel, M F;Downing, J R;Rettenmier, C W;Sherr, C J"

To aid our understanding of this relationship, we have constructed a physical map of this region of the genome using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Fifteen newly identified 11p13-specific probes and four previously reported probes were used to subdivide 11p13 into five intervals defined by overlapping constitutional deletions from several WAGR patients. This new repertoire of DNA probes was used to construct a physical map of this region using the infrequently cutting restriction enzymes MIuI and NotI. This map spans approximately 13 Mb and encompasses deletion and translocation breakpoints associated with genitourinary abnormalities, aniridia, and Wilms' tumor. The map also makes it possible to localize the genes for Wilms' tumor (WT) and aniridia (AN2) to a small number of specific NotI restriction fragments.","Compton, D A;Weil, M M;Jones, C;Riccardi, V M;Strong, L C;Saunders, G F"
3180223,1988,Cell,Activation of c-myc by woodchuck hepatitis virus insertion in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Two hepatocellular carcinomas, induced in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus, were characterized for viral integration near c-myc and alterations of c-myc expression. In one tumor, viral integration within the untranslated region of c-myc exon 3 resulted in overexpression of a long c-myc viral cotranscript. In the second tumor, a single insertion of highly rearranged viral sequences 600 bp upstream of c-myc exon 1 was associated with increased levels of normal c-myc mRNA. In both cases, viral enhancer insertion and disruption of normal c-myc transcriptional or posttranscriptional control appear to be involved in c-myc activation. These results demonstrate that integration of woodchuck hepatitis virus near a cellular proto-oncogene, as in several retroviral models, can contribute to the genesis of liver tumors.","Hsu, T;Möröy, T;Etiemble, J;Louise, A;Trépo, C;Tiollais, P;Buendia, M A"

To test this hypothesis, we have constructed an int-1 allele resembling those found in virus-induced tumors, with an MMTV LTR placed 5' to the int-1 gene in the opposite transcriptional orientation. Transgenic mice harboring this allele express int-1 RNA at high levels in mammary and salivary glands of male and female mice and in male reproductive organs. The mammary glands of males and virgin females are grossly hyperplastic compared with those of nontrasgenic littermates. Mammary and (less frequently) salivary adenocarcinomas occur in these animals at rates indicating that transcriptional activation of int-1 and associated hyperplasia are initiating events in multistep carcinogenesis.","Tsukamoto, A S;Grosschedl, R;Guzman, R C;Parslow, T;Varmus, H E"
2842066,1988,Cell,Retroviral activation of a novel gene encoding a zinc finger protein in IL-3-dependent myeloid leukemia cell lines.,"Normal hematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate in the presence of growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3). Transformation can alter their growth factor requirements, the ability of the cells to differentiate, or both. To identify genes that are capable of transforming hematopoietic cells, IL-3-dependent cell lines, isolated from retrovirus induced myeloid leukemias, were examined for viral insertions in proto-oncogenes and in common sites of viral integration. Five of 37 cell lines contained proviruses in a common viral integration site termed the ecotropic virus integration 1 site (Evi-1). The integrations were correlated with the activation of transcription from the locus. Sequencing of cDNA clones and genomic clones demonstrated that the integrations had occurred near or in 5' noncoding exons of a novel gene. The sequence of the cDNA clones predicts that the gene product is a 120 kd protein that contains two domains with seven and three repeats of a DNA binding consensus sequence (zinc finger) initially described in the Xenopus transcription factor III A (TFIIIA). This represents the first demonstration of the retroviral activation of a gene encoding a zinc finger protein and the first implication for a member of this gene family in the transformation of hematopoietic cells.","Morishita, K;Parker, D S;Mucenski, M L;Jenkins, N A;Copeland, N G;Ihle, J N"

T and p110-114 coprecipitated in each case, implying that the proteins are complexed with each other. Substitution and internal deletion mutants of T that contain structural alterations in a ten residue, transformation-controlling domain failed to complex with p110-114. In contrast, T mutants bearing structural changes outside of this domain bound to p110-114. These results are consistent with a model for transformation by SV40 which, at least in part, involves T/p110-114 complex formation and the perturbation of Rb protein and/or T function.","DeCaprio, J A;Ludlow, J W;Figge, J;Shew, J Y;Huang, C M;Lee, W H;Marsilio, E;Paucha, E;Livingston, D M"

From the fusion products, sublines carrying an inactivated gpt gene were analyzed. UV irradiation increased the frequency of inactivated gpt genes in the fusion cells by 100-fold. One subline was found to contain a complete Alu sequence in the coding region of the gpt gene. The inserted element differed from the Blur8 sequence by only 7 out of the 270 nucleotides.

2898299,1988,Cell,Single-step induction of mammary adenocarcinoma in transgenic mice bearing the activated c-neu oncogene.,"We have used transgenic mice that carry an activated c-neu oncogene driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to assess the stepwise progression of carcinogenesis in mammary epithelium. Unlike the stochastic occurrence of solitary mammary tumors in transgenic mice bearing the MMTV/c-myc or the MMTV/v-Ha-ras oncogenes, transgenic mice uniformly expressing the MMTV/c-neu gene develop mammary adenocarcinomas that involve the entire epithelium in each gland. Because these tumors arise synchronously and are polyclonal in origin, expression of the activated c-neu oncogene appears to be sufficient to induce malignant transformation in this tissue in a single step. In contrast, expression of the c-neu transgene in the parotid gland or epididymis leads to benign, bilateral epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia which does not progress to full malignant transformation during the observation period. These results indicate that the combination of activated oncogene and tissue context are major determinants of malignant progression and that expression of the activated form of c-neu in the mammary epithelium has particularly deleterious consequences.","Muller, W J;Sinn, E;Pattengale, P K;Wallace, R;Leder, P"
2836062,1988,Cell,The human papillomavirus type 16 E7 gene encodes transactivation and transformation functions similar to those of adenovirus E1A.,"Clinical and epidemiological data have implicated the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) as having an etiologic role in some anogenital malignancies, with HPV-16 being most frequently (greater than 60%) detected in cervical carcinoma. HPV-16 is actively transcribed in the cancers; the most abundant transcripts map to the E6 and E7 early open reading frames. Evidence is presented that the HPV-16 E7 open reading frame encodes transcriptional transactivation and cellular transformation functions analogous to those of adenovirus E1A proteins. Specifically, the HPV-16 E7 gene product could transactivate the adenovirus E2 promoter and cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary baby rat kidney cells. The E7 transforming function differed somewhat from that of adenovirus E1A in that E7 was also able to transform established mouse cells. Examination of the amino acid sequence of HPV-16 E7 revealed striking similarities with conserved domains 1 and 2 of adenovirus E1A proteins.","Phelps, W C;Yee, C L;Münger, K;Howley, P M"

We used frozen tumor specimens and single 5 micron sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue surgically removed or obtained at autopsy. Twenty-one out of 22 carcinomas of the exocrine pancreas contained c-K-ras genes with mutations at codon 12. In seven cases tested, the mutation was present in both primary tumors and their corresponding metastases. No mutations were detected in normal tissue from the same cancer patients or in five gall bladder carcinomas. We conclude from these results that c-K-ras somatic mutational activation is a critical event in the oncogenesis of most, if not all, human cancers of the exocrine pancreas.","Almoguera, C;Shibata, D;Forrester, K;Martin, J;Arnheim, N;Perucho, M"

These suppressors are the subject of much speculation, but whether or not they are ultimately determined to be the regulators of differentiation antigens, growth factors, or proto-oncogenes, it is certain that the investigation of such loci will allow yet another glimpse at the inner mysteries of organismal development.","Hansen, M F;Cavenee, W K"

Repair is defective in extracts from all xeroderma pigmentosum cell lines investigated, representing the genetic complementation groups A, B, C, D, H, and V. Mixing of cell extracts of group A and C origin leads to reconstitution of the DNA repair activity.","Wood, R D;Robins, P;Lindahl, T"
3258192,1988,Cell,Molecular analysis of a t(7;14)(q35;q32) chromosome translocation in a T cell leukemia of a patient with ataxia telangiectasia.,"Molecular analysis of somatic cell hybrids derived from T cells carrying a t(7;14)(q35;q32) chromosomal translocation from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia and T cell leukemia indicates that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 is proximal to the IgH locus and to the D14S1 locus, while the breakpoint on chromosome 7 involves the T cell receptor beta chain locus immediately 5' to J beta 1.5 on chromosome 7. The separation of V beta and C beta observed in somatic cell hybrids defined the orientation of the T cell receptor beta chain locus on chromosome 7 where the V beta genes are centromeric and the C beta genes are telomeric. A novel chromosomal alteration, undetected cytogenetically, was revealed as being an inversion with duplication of the distal band of chromosome 14q32. The importance of the 14q32 region in the leukemogenic process is discussed.","Russo, G;Isobe, M;Pegoraro, L;Finan, J;Nowell, P C;Croce, C M"
2832065,1988,Cell,A glioma-derived PDGF A chain homodimer has different functional activities from a PDGF AB heterodimer purified from human platelets.,"Glioma-derived growth factor I (GDGF-I) is structurally similar to a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A chain homodimer, whereas PDGF purified from human platelets is a heterodimer of one A and one B chain. Binding experiments revealed that GDGF-I and PDGF bound to a common receptor on human fibroblasts, but also suggested the presence of a second receptor type recognizing only PDGF. In contrast to PDGF, GDGF-I had only a limited mitogenic activity, a low ability to stimulate receptor autophosphorylation and actin reorganization, and no chemotactic activity. GDGF-I did, however, cause transmodulation of EGF receptors, suggesting that it, like PDGF, activates protein kinase C in fibroblasts. These data indicate that different PDGF-like growth factors have different functional activities, which are possibly mediated via different receptors.","Nistér, M;Hammacher, A;Mellström, K;Siegbahn, A;Rönnstrand, L;Westermark, B;Heldin, C H"
3162207,1988,Cell,Altered growth regulation and enhanced tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with protein kinase C-I cDNA.,"Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with plasmids containing rat brain protein kinase C-I (PKC-I) cDNA controlled by strong viral promoter/enhancer elements led to PKC-I gene expression as assessed by Northern analysis, cellular binding of phorbol ester, immunoblotting of cellular PKC, and membrane-associated PKC activity. While transfection did not induce foci, altered growth regulation was observed in established transfectant lines: transfectants displayed reduced dependence on serum for growth, grew to higher saturation densities, and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity when inoculated into nude mice. Continued high-level expression of PKC-I, however, may not be obligatory for the malignant phenotype in vivo. Tumors that retained transfected sequences had lower PKC-I transcript levels than the parental in vitro lines, suggesting an in vivo modulation. Our data show that PKC-I dysregulation leads to altered cell growth regulation and may be functionally equivalent to the action of tumor promoters.","Persons, D A;Wilkison, W O;Bell, R M;Finn, O J"
3125981,1988,Cell,Plasminogen activator dependent pathways in the dissemination of human tumor cells in the chick embryo.,"We have previously shown that inhibition of uPA activity of a human tumor-HEp3-results in a drastic reduction of its metastasis in the chick embryo. Using 125IUdR-labeled tumor cells, we have now studied the role of uPA in individual steps of tumor metastasis. We found that, 48 hr after inoculation of tumor cells on the CAM, the organs of the embryos, inoculated with cells in which uPA was inhibited, contained 4-fold less cells than the controls. Neither the initial advance of the tumor mass into the CAM nor the process of extravasation was affected by the inhibition of tumor uPA. However, the infiltration of the CAM mesenchyme by individual tumor cells was blocked when tumor uPA activity or production was inhibited. In addition, indirect evidence implicated uPA as an essential factor in the tumor cell intravasation.","Ossowski, L"
3277717,1988,Cell,A non-AUG translational initiation in c-myc exon 1 generates an N-terminally distinct protein whose synthesis is disrupted in Burkitt's lymphomas.,"The c-myc gene comprises three exons with a single large AUG-initiated open reading frame extending from exon 2 through exon 3. Exon 1 lacks any AUG codons. Cells from a wide range of species produce two c-myc proteins that, while highly related, do not appear to arise from posttranslational interconversion. To understand the origin of the two proteins, we mapped them and analyzed the in vitro protein-coding capacity of c-myc cDNAs. Our findings show that the two proteins are derived from alternative translational initiations at the exon 2 AUG and at a non-AUG codon near the 3' end of exon 1, resulting in the production of proteins with distinct N termini. In Burkitt's lymphomas, the removal or specific mutation of exon 1 in c-myc translocations correlates with suppression of synthesis of the larger protein, and thus may contribute to the oncogenic activation of c-myc.","Hann, S R;King, M W;Bentley, D L;Anderson, C W;Eisenman, R N"
2893664,1988,Cell,Impaired neurotransmitter uptake in PC12 cells overexpressing human Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase--implication for gene dosage effects in Down syndrome.,"Rat PC12 cells expressing elevated levels of transfected human Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) gene were generated. These transformants (designated PC12-hSOD) closely resembled the parental cells in their morphology, growth rate, and response to nerve growth factor, but showed impaired neurotransmitter uptake. The lesion was localized to the chromaffin granule transport mechanism. We found that the pH gradient (delta pH) across the membrane, which is the main driving force for amine transport, was diminished in PC12-hSOD granules. These results show that elevation of CuZnSOD activity interferes with the transport of biogenic amines into chromaffin granules. Since neurotransmitter uptake plays an important role in many processes of the central nervous system, CuZnSOD gene-dosage may contribute to the neurobiological abnormalities of Down's syndrome.","Elroy-Stein, O;Groner, Y"
3345558,1988,Cell,Embryonic lethalities and endothelial tumors in chimeric mice expressing polyoma virus middle T oncogene.,"The effect of the middle T oncogene of polyoma virus was studied in vivo using a replication-defective selectable retrovirus. Injection of virus into newborn and adult mice resulted in the rapid appearance of cavernous hemangiomas. Infection of embryos did not yield transgenic mice; therefore, embryonal stem (ES) cells were used as an alternative system. Several infected ES cell clones were established that constitutively expressed middle T and its associated tyrosine kinase activity. Chimeric embryos obtained by blastocyst injection of individual ES cell clones were specifically arrested at midgestation, when multiple hemangiomas disrupted blood vessel formation. From these tumors endothelial cell lines were established that retained expression of von Willebrand factor yet were tumorigenic in vivo. These results suggest that middle T acts in endothelial cells as a single-step oncogene and that ES cells provide a valuable system for the study of growth control during embryogenesis.","Williams, R L;Courtneidge, S A;Wagner, E F"
2894250,1988,Cell,"Proliferation, senescence, and neoplastic progression of beta cells in hyperplasic pancreatic islets.","Three different cases of pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia in mice are accompanied by an increase in a subclass of cells expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a neuronal enzyme. In the nontumorigenic cases of islet growth during normal pregnancy and in the obese mutant mouse, the TH-insulin cells do not divide, in contrast to the ""insulin-only"" cells. In later stages the number of proliferating insulin-only cells decreases concomitant with an increase in the number of nondividing TH-insulin cells, suggesting that the TH-insulin cells are on a pathway to senescence. In the presence of an oncoprotein the TH-insulin cells are able to proliferate. The proliferation of this cell type may represent an escape from the senescence pathway and progression to immortal tumor cells.","Teitelman, G;Alpert, S;Hanahan, D"
3500791,1987,Cell,Overexpression of the human EGF receptor confers an EGF-dependent transformed phenotype to NIH 3T3 cells.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in human malignancies. To investigate the biological effects of its overexpression, we constructed a eukaryotic vector containing human EGFR cDNA. Introduction of this construct led to reconstitution of functional EGF receptors in NR6 mutant cells, which are normally devoid of this receptor. Transfection of NIH 3T3 resulted in no significant alterations in growth properties. However, EGF addition led to the formation of densely growing transformed foci in liquid culture and colonies in semisolid medium. NIH 3T3-EGFR clonal lines, which expressed the EGF at 500- to 1000-fold levels over control NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrated a marked increase in DNA synthesis in response to EGF. Thus EGF receptor overexpression appears to amplify normal EGF signal transduction. Finally, high levels of EGFR expression, which conferred a transformed phenotype to NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of ligand, were demonstrated in representative human tumor cell lines that contained amplified copies of the EGFR gene.","Di Fiore, P P;Pierce, J H;Fleming, T P;Hazan, R;Ullrich, A;King, C R;Schlessinger, J;Aaronson, S A"
3315232,1987,Cell,Activated N-ras controls the transformed phenotype of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.,"To investigate whether the activated N-ras oncogene of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells contributes to the expression of the transformed phenotype, we have isolated flat revertants. In two independent revertant lines, an increase in chromosomal ploidy occurred without a concomitant increase in the number of copies of the N-ras transforming allele. Immunoprecipitation confirms that the level of the mutant N-ras p21 gene product in the revertants is correspondingly lower than in HT1080. Analysis of sporadic tumors derived from the revertant cells reveals an increased dosage of the transforming allele. The revertants also retransform after transfection of cloned activated ras oncogenes. These results imply direct participation of an N-ras oncogene in maintaining the transformed phenotype of a human tumor cell line.","Paterson, H;Reeves, B;Brown, R;Hall, A;Furth, M;Bos, J;Jones, P;Marshall, C"
2824063,1987,Cell,Multilineage hematopoietic disorders induced by transplantation of bone marrow cells expressing the v-fms oncogene.,"Mouse bone marrow cells infected with a helper-free retrovirus containing v-fms were engrafted into lethally irradiated mice. Dominant provirus-positive clones emerged in the spleens of some recipients within 1 month. When spleen cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated secondary recipients, clonal erythroleukemias or B cell lymphomas expressing the v-fms-coded glycoprotein developed. Other secondary recipients repopulated by ""unmarked"" progenitor cells or by cryptic provirus-positive precursors present in the spleens of the same donor mice did not develop disease; thus cells expressing v-fms did not invariably have a proliferative advantage after transplantation. Several primary engrafted recipients developed myeloproliferative disorders that were provirus-positive without evidence of clonality. Although expression of the c-fms product (CSF-1 receptor) is normally restricted to cells of the mononuclear phagocyte series, the v-fms-coded glycoprotein can contribute to proliferative abnormalities of multiple hematopoietic lineages.","Heard, J M;Roussel, M F;Rettenmier, C W;Sherr, C J"
2824060,1987,Cell,Progression to steroid insensitivity can occur irrespective of the presence of functional steroid receptors.,"A major problem in treatment of cancers arising in steroid-sensitive cells is their inevitable progression to a steroid-insensitive state; current therapies are based on the assumption that hormone insensitivity is associated with loss of receptor. We demonstrate for the first time that breast tumor cells can progress to steroid insensitivity in spite of functional steroid receptors. Transfection of the steroid-inducible LTR-C3 gene into unresponsive S115 mouse mammary tumor cells results in full inducibility of that gene with both androgen and glucocorticoid. Thus, although all known endogenous inducible parameters are lost, the steroid sensitivity of a transfected exogenous gene demonstrates that the machinery for steroid responsiveness is still fully functional. Furthermore, these transfected genes retain steroid sensitivity only while steroid is present; on prolonged withdrawal of steroid, they lose responsiveness, implying an epigenetic mechanism is involved.","Darbre, P D;King, R J"
2445489,1987,Cell,Endothelial cell tumors develop in transgenic mice carrying polyoma virus middle T oncogene.,"Inoculation of newborn mice with the murine polyoma (Py) virus leads to tumor formation in a wide range of tissues. In order to investigate viral oncogenesis, we generated transgenic mice carrying either the Py large T antigen (LT) gene or the Py middle T antigen (MT) gene linked to Py early region regulatory sequences. While Py LT mice exhibit no phenotype, Py MT mice develop multifocal tumors of the vascular endothelium. These hemangiomas are lethal to the animals and can be passaged in vivo. Transgene RNAs and protein are present in both hemangiomas and the testes of these mice, and the Py middle T protein in both tissues is complexed to a cellular tyrosine kinase. The expression of complexed middle T protein in both tumorigenic endothelial cells and unperturbed testes implies that endothelial cells may be particularly susceptible to the action of the middle T oncogene. These observations indicate that Py middle T disrupts the normal strict controls on vascular growth, and suggest that Py MT transgenic mice will provide a model for studying the control of angiogenesis.","Bautch, V L;Toda, S;Hassell, J A;Hanahan, D"
3664639,1987,Cell,Revertants of v-fos-transformed fibroblasts have mutations in cellular genes essential for transformation by other oncogenes.,"Morphologic revertants of FBJ murine sarcoma virus (v-fos)-transformed rat-1 fibroblasts were isolated using a novel selection procedure based on prolonged retention of rhodamine 123 within mitochondria of v-fos-transformed versus normal fibroblasts. Two classes of revertants were isolated: class I revertants have sustained mutations in cellular genes, and a class II revertant has a nonfunctional v-fos provirus. Somatic-cell hybridization studies suggested that the revertant phenotype was recessive to the transformed phenotype. Class I revertants were also resistant to retransformation by v-gag-fos-fox, v-Ha-ras, v-abl, and v-mos, but could be retransformed by the trk oncogene and polyoma virus middle T antigen. These results suggest that the class I revertants sustained mutations in one or more cellular genes essential for transformation by some, but not all, oncogenes. Our data suggest the existence of common biochemical pathways for transformation.","Zarbl, H;Latreille, J;Jolicoeur, P"
3499231,1987,Cell,The effect of alterations in myc gene expression on B cell development in the bursa of Fabricius.,"Infection of 18-day embryonic bursal lymphocytes with a v-myc-containing retrovirus leads directly to a polyclonal proliferation of surface immunoglobulin-positive (slg+) cells in the bursa of Fabricius detected four weeks after hatching. These v-myc-expressing bursal cells repopulate the follicles of chemically ablated bursae more efficiently than total normal 18-day embryonic bursal cells. In contrast, comparable normal bursal cells lose the ability to repopulate follicles by four weeks. Bursal lymphocytes expressing either a retroviral v-myc or a c-myc gene deregulated by adjacent retroviral integration retain the ability of embryonic bursal lymphocytes to diversify their immunoglobulin light chain genes. These results suggest that retroviral deregulation of myc expression during avian B cell development induces outgrowth of a population of cells with the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of bursal stem cells.","Thompson, C B;Humphries, E H;Carlson, L M;Chen, C L;Neiman, P E"
3311384,1987,Cell,Teratocarcinoma stem cells and early mouse embryos contain only a single major lamin polypeptide closely resembling lamin B.,"The nuclear lamina in adult mammalian somatic cells is composed of three major proteins, lamins A, B, and C. The expression of these proteins during the differentiation of teratocarcinomas and mouse embryogenesis is described. Embryos up to day 8 of gestation and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells express only a single lamin species closely resembling, if not identical to, lamin B. Lamins A and/or C were detected in fertilized eggs, but disappear during the first 2-4 cleavage divisions, only reappearing in 8 day post-implantation embryos. These two lamins are absent from EC cells, but are strongly expressed in some of their derivatives. These results show that cells of the early mouse embryo do not have a functional requirement for lamins A and C and imply that the structural organization of the nucleus may change fundamentally during embryogenesis.","Stewart, C;Burke, B"
2889531,1987,Cell,Genomic footprinting reveals cell type-specific DNA binding of ubiquitous factors.,"Using in vivo dimethylsulfate footprinting, we have analyzed protein-DNA interactions within two regions upstream of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene that are characterized by an altered chromatin structure in TAT-expressing as compared to nonexpressing cells. All the identified protein contacts to DNA are found exclusively in the TAT-expressing hepatoma cells. In vitro analyses of specific DNA-binding factors in crude nuclear extracts yield DNAase I footprints that correlate well with the binding sites in vivo. Surprisingly, all DNA-binding activities are present in nuclei of TAT-expressing and nonexpressing cells, indicating that the mere presence of factors is not sufficient for their interaction with a binding site in vivo. Genomic sequencing reveals methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the regions analyzed in nonexpressing cells, whereas no methylation is found in TAT-expressing cells. In vitro methylation at a cytosine residue within a footprint region prevents the interaction of a factor with its binding site.","Becker, P B;Ruppert, S;Schütz, G"
2820586,1987,Cell,v-myb dominance over v-myc in doubly transformed chick myelomonocytic cells.,"Chick myelomonocytic cells transformed by the v-myc oncogene resemble mature macrophages; those transformed by v-myb or v-myb,ets exhibit an immature phenotype. We have analyzed whether these oncogenes are capable of altering the differentiation phenotype of transformed cells by introducing both v-myc plus either v-myb or v-myb,ets into the same cells. Surprisingly, the doubly transformed cells were found to be essentially indistinguishable from cells transformed by v-myb or v-myb,ets alone even when they expressed a high level of v-myc protein. These results demonstrate that v-myb is dominant over v-myc and that, while v-myc induces cell proliferation without affecting differentiation, v-myb induces in the same target cells both proliferation and a block or reversal of differentiation.","Ness, S A;Beug, H;Graf, T"
2820585,1987,Cell,Unique fusion of bcr and c-abl genes in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the product of t(9:22), is the cytogenetic hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is translocated to the Ph chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The Ph chromosome is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Although the c-abl is translocated and a new 190 kd c-abl protein has been identified, no breakpoints are observed in the bcr (Ph+bcr- ALL). Here we show that in Ph+bcr- ALL, breakpoints in chromosome 22 occur within the same bcr gene, but more 5' of the bcr. Cloning of a chimeric bcr-c-abl cDNA demonstrates that the fusion gene is transcribed into a 7 kb mRNA, encoding a novel fusion protein.","Hermans, A;Heisterkamp, N;von Linden, M;van Baal, S;Meijer, D;van der Plas, D;Wiedemann, L M;Groffen, J;Bootsma, D;Grosveld, G"

The levels of the same transcripts were also increased following transformation by polyoma virus and by ras and myc oncogenes. The presence of the ID element appeared to be determinant, since a similar pattern of expression was observed for a construct where one element had been inserted in the 3' noncoding region of a rabbit beta-globin gene expressed under control of an SV40 promoter.","Glaichenhaus, N;Cuzin, F"
2957064,1987,Cell,Functional domains of adenovirus type 5 E1a proteins.,"Adenovirus E1a proteins function in transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, cellular DNA synthesis induction, and cellular transformation. Here we examine the role of the previously undefined E1a region 1, the last of three conserved E1a regions to be characterized. Region 1 is required for transcriptional repression, transformation, and DNA synthesis induction, but not transcriptional activation. These results support our previous suggestion that transcriptional repression is the basis of E1a-mediated transformation. Two conserved regions (regions 1 and 2), present in both early E1a proteins, are essential for transcriptional repression, transformation, and induction of DNA synthesis. In contrast, mutagenesis suggests that transcriptional activation requires only 49 amino acids (region 3) unique to the 289 amino acid E1a protein. This we prove by demonstrating that a 49 amino acid region 3 synthetic peptide efficiently activates an E1a-inducible promoter. This peptide is the smallest known protein fragment functioning as a transcriptional activator.","Lillie, J W;Loewenstein, P M;Green, M R;Green, M"
2441878,1987,Cell,Common elements in growth factor stimulation and oncogenic transformation: 85 kd phosphoprotein and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity.,"The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine in vivo and in vitro was examined in 3T3 cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transformed by polyoma middle T antigen (MTAg) by using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (P-tyr). Two common events were observed upon PDGF stimulation or MTAg transformation of cells: the appearance in the immunoprecipitates of an 85 kd phosphoprotein, and increased phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity. In PDGF-stimulated cells, the 85 kd phosphoprotein and PI kinase activity appeared rapidly, within 1 min of growth factor addition. The PI kinase activity and 85 kd phosphorylation were also increased in anti-P-tyr immunoprecipitates from cells transformed by v-fms and v-sis, but not by SV40 T antigen. The presence of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 85 kd protein correlated with PI kinase activity during several purification steps. These results suggest that the 85 kd phosphoprotein, a putative PI kinase, is a substrate for both the PDGF receptor and MTAg/pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activities.","Kaplan, D R;Whitman, M;Schaffhausen, B;Pallas, D C;White, M;Cantley, L;Roberts, T M"
2957062,1987,Cell,An oncogene isolated by transfection of Kaposi's sarcoma DNA encodes a growth factor that is a member of the FGF family.,"We recently reported the cloning of a rearranged human oncogene following transfection of DNA from Kaposi's sarcoma into NIH 3T3 cells. To identify the protein(s) encoded in two novel mRNAs of 3.5 and 1.2 kb expressed in NIH 3T3 transformants, we constructed a cDNA library. One of the cDNA clones isolated (KS3) corresponded to the 1.2 kb mRNA and transformed NIH 3T3 cell when inserted into a mammalian expression vector. The 1152 nucleotide KS3 cDNA encodes a protein of 206 amino acids with significant homology to the growth factors basic FGF and acidic FGF. Expression of the KS3 product as a bacterial fusion protein or in COS cells allowed us to determine that both proteins had significant growth-promoting activity and that the COS cell protein was glycosylated. Thus one of the mRNAs transcribed from the KS oncogene encodes a growth factor that could transform cells by an autocrine mechanism and appears to represent a new member of the FGF family.","Delli Bovi, P;Curatola, A M;Kern, F G;Greco, A;Ittmann, M;Basilico, C"
3607879,1987,Cell,Tumors secreting human TNF/cachectin induce cachexia in mice.,"Anorexia and weight loss are serious complications that adversely effect the prognosis of cancer patients. It has been suggested that TNF/cachectin may cause cachexia. To determine if TNF/cachectin can induce progressive weight loss in tumor-bearing animals, a clone of the human TNF/cachectin gene was isolated and inserted into a mammalian expression vector. This construct was transfected into CHO cells, and a cell line (CHO/TNF-20) that secretes TNF/cachectin was isolated. A cell line (CHO/CMV-Neo) that contains the same expression vector without the TNF/cachectin gene was also isolated. Nude mice injected intraperitoneally with CHO/TNF-20 cells died more quickly than mice injected with CHO/CMV-Neo cells. Eighty-seven percent of mice inoculated intramuscularly with CHO/TNF-20 cells developed severe cachexia and weight loss. All mice bearing CHO/CMV-Neo tumors maintained or increased their body weight. We conclude that mice bearing tumors that secrete TNF/cachectin develop progressive wasting and die more quickly than mice bearing control tumors.","Oliff, A;Defeo-Jones, D;Boyer, M;Martinez, D;Kiefer, D;Vuocolo, G;Wolfe, A;Socher, S H"
3036367,1987,Cell,The mechanism of chromosome 14 inversion in a human T cell lymphoma.,"The chromosome 14 inversion produces cytogenetic breakpoints at either end of the long arm of this chromosome. Previous studies have shown that a hybrid gene (designated IgT) consisting of an immunoglobulin VH gene segment and T cell receptor J alpha C alpha segments encompasses the telomeric breakpoint in SUP-T1, a cell line derived from a human T cell lymphoma. Here, we report that the centromeric breakpoint in SUP-T1 constitutes the reciprocal of a VH-J alpha join but involves gene segments different from those at the telomeric breakpoint. Therefore, chromosome inversion and IgT formation were mediated by two sequential VH-J alpha joining events. Moreover, sequences adjacent to the centromeric breakpoint detect a T-cell-specific RNA, encoded within the immunoglobulin VH locus, whose transcriptional activity may have facilitated the illegitimate VH-J alpha rearrangements.","Baer, R;Forster, A;Rabbitts, T H"
3036364,1987,Cell,Analysis of DNA surrounding the breakpoints of chromosomal translocations involving the beta T cell receptor gene in human lymphoblastic neoplasms.,"DNA containing breakpoints of two different t(7;9) chromosomal translocations was cloned from the T lymphoblastic tumor cell lines SUP-T1 and SUP-T3. Sequence analysis of DNA from the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation of SUP-T1 revealed that chromosome 9 DNA had recombined with DNA 5' to rearranged D-J regions in the beta T cell receptor gene of chromosome 7. Restriction analysis and hybridization studies using DNA fragments cloned from the t(7;9)(q34;32) translocation of SUP-T3 confirmed that beta T cell receptor DNA is also joined to the DNA of chromosome 9 in these cells. Using hybridization probes for the two breakpoints, several other cases of T lymphoblastic tumors were shown to possess DNA rearrangements near the 9q34.3 and 9q32 sites. Hybridization with the 9q34.3 probe detected multiple transcripts in SUP-T1 RNA and small amounts of larger transcripts in T cells lacking the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. This work directly demonstrates that the beta T cell receptor locus may frequently be involved in chromosomal translocations within T lymphoblastic neoplasms.","Reynolds, T C;Smith, S D;Sklar, J"
2884040,1987,Cell,Expression of the v-erbA oncogene in chicken embryo fibroblasts stimulates their proliferation in vitro and enhances tumor growth in vivo.,"In contrast to uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), CEFs infected with a retroviral vector that carries the v-erbA gene of avian erythroblastosis virus displayed new properties. These included limited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, growth without latency in serum-supplemented medium, ability to overcome quiescence induced by serum deprivation, growth at low cell density, and an extended life span in vitro. Furthermore, when explanted in vivo onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryo, the transformed CEFs expressing v-erbA in addition to v-erbB exhibited a high proliferative rate, giving rise to fibrosarcoma tumors that were ten times larger than those developed from transformed CEFs expressing v-erbB alone. All these data show that CEFs expressing the v-erbA oncogene display activated growth and suggest that the v-erbA product interferes with the mechanisms regulating the growth and/or differentiation of primary CEFs.","Gandrillon, O;Jurdic, P;Benchaibi, M;Xiao, J H;Ghysdael, J;Samarut, J"
2884037,1987,Cell,Genetic linkage of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis to the nerve growth factor receptor gene.,"von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRNF) is one of the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system. VRNF is transmitted as an autosomal dominant defect with high penetrance but variable expressivity. The disorder is characterized clinically by hyperpigmented patches of skin (café au lait macules, axillary freckles) and by multiple tumors of peripheral nerve, spinal nerve roots, and brain (neurofibromas, optic gliomas). These tumors can cause disfigurement, paralysis, blindness, and death. We have determined the chromosomal location of the VRNF gene by genetic linkage analysis using DNA markers. The VRNF gene is genetically linked to the locus encoding nerve growth factor receptor, located on the long arm of chromosome 17 in the region 17q12----17q22. However, crossovers with the VRNF locus suggest that a mutation in the nerve growth factor receptor gene itself is unlikely to be the fundamental defect responsible for the VRNF phenotype.","Seizinger, B R;Rouleau, G A;Ozelius, L J;Lane, A H;Faryniarz, A G;Chao, M V;Huson, S;Korf, B R;Parry, D M;Pericak-Vance, M A"
3032456,1987,Cell,Coexpression of MMTV/v-Ha-ras and MMTV/c-myc genes in transgenic mice: synergistic action of oncogenes in vivo.,"We have derived and mated separate strains of transgenic mice that carry either the v-Ha-ras or the c-myc gene driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter/enhancer. Mice carrying the MMTV/v-Ha-ras transgene manifest two distinct disturbances of cell growth. The first, a benign hyperplasia of the Harderian lacrimal gland, is diffuse, involves the entire gland, and likely requires only the abnormal action of the v-Ha-ras gene. The second involves the focal development of malignancies of mammary, salivary, and lymphoid tissue and likely requires additional somatic events. When the MMTV/v-Ha-ras and MMTV/c-myc strains are crossed to yield hybrid mice, their joint action results in a dramatic and synergistic acceleration of tumor formation. Since these tumors arise stochastically and are apparently monoclonal in origin, additional somatic events appear necessary for their full malignant progression, even in the presence of activated v-Ha-ras and c-myc transgenes.","Sinn, E;Muller, W;Pattengale, P;Tepler, I;Wallace, R;Leder, P"

The gene is comprised of two exons separated by more than 15 kb. Two species of mRNAs are produced, and DNA sequencing analysis shows that they code for two proteins differing at their C terminus: a 7.5 kb transcript codes for a polypeptide of 236 amino acids, mbcl-2 alpha, and a 2.4 kb transcript, which derives from the 5' exon only, codes for a protein of 199 amino acids, mbcl-2 beta. The gene is characterized by very long (5' about 1.4 kb, and 3' about 5.1 kb) untranslated regions surrounding the relatively short coding region. We have mapped the 5' end of the mbcl-2 mRNAs by S1 protection analysis, and we have analyzed the promoter region. The expression of the mbcl-2 gene was analyzed in different cell lines and in mouse tissues. Expression is tissue-specific in adult tissues: spleen and thymus express the highest level of mbcl-2 transcripts. The mbcl-2 gene maps to mouse chromosome 1.","Negrini, M;Silini, E;Kozak, C;Tsujimoto, Y;Croce, C M"
2952280,1987,Cell,An adenovirus E1A-like transcription factor is regulated during the differentiation of murine embryonal carcinoma stem cells.,The expression of the E2A transcription unit of the adenovirus E1A deletion mutant dl312 in murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells suggests that they contain an activity that will complement viral E1A. We have prepared from these cells in vitro transcription extracts that use E1A-inducible promoters more efficiently than do extracts from a differentiated cell line. Mixing experiments demonstrate that the EC phenotype is dominant. Gel retardation assays using the E2A promoter detect a binding activity present in F9 and PCC4 EC cells but not in differentiated cells. Our data indicate that EC stem cells contain a transcription factor that is analogous to viral E1A and is likely to be involved in the control of cellular gene expression during differentiation.,"La Thangue, N B;Rigby, P W"
3032449,1987,Cell,Transformation by Rous sarcoma virus induces a novel gene with homology to a mitogenic platelet protein.,"A cDNA clone, designated 9E3, was isolated from a chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cDNA library. 9E3 mRNA was 20-fold higher in CEF following transformation by Rous sarcoma virus because of increased transcription rate. In CEF infected with temperature-sensitive mutants, increased 9E3 mRNA was found within 2 hr of a shift to permissive temperature. Nucleotide sequence and in vitro translation results indicate that 9E3 mRNA encodes an 11 kd polypeptide that is homologous to human connective tissue activating peptide III (CTAP-III), a mitogenic platelet alpha-granule protein, and to beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. The reported biological activities of CTAP-III suggest that elevated expression of 9E3 may play a role in producing some of the phenotypic features of RSV-transformed cells.","Sugano, S;Stoeckle, M Y;Hanafusa, H"
3032447,1987,Cell,Pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma: expression of an activated c-myc oncogene causes the tumorigenic conversion of EBV-infected human B lymphoblasts.,"To study the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma, we introduced activated c-myc genes into human EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells derived from in vitro infection of normal cord blood or directly from infected peripheral blood from AIDS patients. In both cell types the constitutive expression of exogenous c-myc caused negative regulation of endogenous c-myc expression, changes in growth properties typical of transformed cells, and acquisition of tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. In all myc-transfected populations the degree of malignancy directly correlated with the level of c-myc mRNA. EBV infection and c-myc activation are thus sufficient for the tumorigenic conversion of human B cells in vitro, strongly supporting the hypothesis that these same two pathogenetic steps may be involved in the in vivo development of Burkitt lymphoma.","Lombardi, L;Newcomb, E W;Dalla-Favera, R"
3103927,1987,Cell,Cell transformation by pp60c-src mutated in the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain.,"We introduced two mutations into the carboxy-terminal regulatory region of chicken pp60c-src. One, F527, replaces tyrosine 527 with phenylalanine. The other, Am517, produces a truncated pp60c-src protein lacking the 17 carboxy-terminal amino acids. Both mutant proteins were phosphorylated at tyrosine 416 in vivo. The specific activity of the Am517 mutant protein kinase was similar to that of wild-type pp60c-src whereas that of the F527 mutant was 5- to 10-fold higher. Both mutant c-src genes induced focus formation on NIH 3T3 cells, but the foci appeared at lower frequency, and were smaller than foci induced by polyoma middle tumor antigen (mT). The wild-type or F527 pp60c-src formed a complex with mT, whereas the Am517 pp60c-src did not. The results suggest that one, inability to phosphorylate tyrosine 527 increases pp60c-src protein kinase activity and transforming ability; two, transformation by mT involves other events besides lack of phosphorylation at tyrosine 527 of pp60c-src; three, activation of the pp60c-src protein kinase may not be required for transformation by the Am517 mutant; and four, the carboxyl terminus of pp60c-src appears to be required for association with mT.","Cartwright, C A;Eckhart, W;Simon, S;Kaplan, P L"
3103925,1987,Cell,Activation and suppression of pp60c-src transforming ability by mutation of its primary sites of tyrosine phosphorylation.,"pp60c-src is phosphorylated in vivo at tyrosine 527, a residue not present in pp60v-src (its transforming homolog), and not at tyrosine 416, its site of in vitro autophosphorylation. To test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation  regulates pp60c-src biological activity, we constructed and studied pp60c-src mutants in which Tyr 527 and Tyr 416 were separately or coordinately altered to phenylalanine. Tyr----Phe 527 mutation strongly activated pp60c-src transforming and kinase activities, whereas the additional introduction of a Tyr----Phe 416 mutation suppressed these activities. Tyr----Phe 416 mutation of normal pp60c-src eliminated its partial transforming activity, which suggests that transient or otherwise restricted phosphorylation of Tyr 416 is important for pp60c-src function even though stable phosphorylation is not observed in vivo.","Kmiecik, T E;Shalloway, D"
3030568,1987,Cell,Creation of a processed pseudogene by retroviral infection.,"We have previously characterized a cell line transformed by a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, SE21Q1b, which contains a mutation preventing encapsidation of genomic RNA. A unique property of this mutant is that cellular RNAs are packaged into virions, even in the presence of replication-competent virus. In the current study, SE21Q1b quail cells were transfected with the plasmids pRSVneo or pCMVneo. Virions produced by SE21Q1b neoR clones contained neo RNA, and when virus from some SE21Q1b neoR clones was used to infect a chemically transformed quail cell line, QT35, neoR QT35 clones were obtained that contained single integrated copies of the neo gene. An intron inserted into pRSVneo was removed during gene transfer. These data are consistent with transfer of neo mRNAs by a pathway involving reverse transcription of mRNA encapsidated within SE21Q1b virions, and integration of resultant cDNAs into the genome of infected QT35 cells.","Linial, M"
2435413,1987,Cell,A subset of T cell receptors associated with L3T4 molecules mediates C6VL leukemia cell binding of its cognate retrovirus.,"We show here that the interaction of a radiation leukemia virus-induced thymoma, C6VL, with its cognate retroviruses occurs in the vicinity of the T cell receptor (TCR). While an anti-clonotypic antibody completely inhibits this interaction, antibodies specific for another T cell receptor complex determinant, L3T4, only partially inhibit the cell-retrovirus interaction. Several antibodies to more abundant cell-surface determinants (T200, Ly15, H-2Db) do not inhibit this interaction. Under capping conditions, either of the antibodies to L3T4 or TCR epitopes modulate virus binding receptors from the surface of C6VL/1 cells. L3T4 and the TCR do not comodulate significantly on the surface of C6VL/1 cells. These experimental findings implicate the existence of rare TCR-L3T4 complexes on C6VL/1 cells, and the involvement of these complexes in the binding of C6VL/1 to its cognate retrovirus. In addition, the clonotypic anti-TCR antibody inhibits C6VL/1 cell proliferation at concentrations that block its binding to its produced retroviruses.","O'Neill, H C;McGrath, M S;Allison, J P;Weissman, I L"
3493849,1987,Cell,Bone marrow stromal cell lines with lymphopoietic activity express high levels of a pre-B neoplasia-associated molecule.,"Bone marrow stromal cell lines have been isolated that directly support B lymphopoiesis in vitro. Single B-lineage precursors proliferate and differentiate on certain of these stromal cell lines to establish long-term B-lineage cultures. These lymphopoietic stromal cells produce novel soluble factors that support proliferation of in vitro established pre-B cell populations. Lymphoid populations established on lymphopoietic stromal cell lines lack surface Ig-bearing cells, but give rise to surface Ig+ cells when transferred to mixed bone marrow feeder layers. Several stromal lines expressed a B-lineage neoplasia marker detected by the monoclonal antibody MAb6C3. Remarkably, only the 6C3Aghi stromal lines supported long-term proliferation of B-lineage cells. We propose that the 6C3 antigen-bearing molecule may play a role in stromal cell-dependent, pre-B cell proliferation, as well as in neoplastic proliferation of pre-B leukemias.","Whitlock, C A;Tidmarsh, G F;Muller-Sieburg, C;Weissman, I L"
3470144,1987,Cell,Pancreatic neoplasia induced by ras expression in acinar cells of transgenic mice.,"Expression of an activated human c-H-ras oncogene under control of rat elastase I regulating elements leads to neoplasia of the fetal exocrine pancreas. In most transgenic mice bearing this gene construct, massive tumors involving all the pancreatic acinar cells develop within a few days of pancreatic differentiation. Expression of the normal c-H-ras proto-oncogene in acinar cells leads to more subtle anomalies, but no tumors develop. Thus modest amounts of the mutant ras proteins are sufficient, in an otherwise normal genetic background, to lead to neoplastic transformation of differentiating pancreatic acinar cells. In contrast, a comparable elastase-myc construct produces no pancreatic tumors in transgenic mice.","Quaife, C J;Pinkert, C A;Ornitz, D M;Palmiter, R D;Brinster, R L"
2879636,1987,Cell,Evidence that transforming growth factor-beta is a hormonally regulated negative growth factor in human breast cancer cells.,"The hormone-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 secretes transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which can be detected in the culture medium in a biologically active form. These polypeptides compete with human platelet-derived TGF-beta for binding to its receptor, are biologically active in TGF-beta-specific growth assays, and are recognized and inactivated by TGF-beta-specific antibodies. Secretion of active TGF-beta is induced 8 to 27-fold under treatment of MCF-7 cells with growth inhibitory concentrations of antiestrogens. Antiestrogen-induced TGF-beta from MCF-7 cells inhibits the growth of an estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell line in coculture experiments; growth inhibition is reversed with anti-TGF-beta antibodies. We conclude that in MCF-7 cells, TGF-beta is a hormonally regulated growth inhibitor with possible autocrine and paracrine functions in breast cancer cells.","Knabbe, C;Lippman, M E;Wakefield, L M;Flanders, K C;Kasid, A;Derynck, R;Dickson, R B"

From analyses of G418-resistant clones containing at least as much intact t as Cos-1 cells, we found that t, alone, had no detectable A31 transforming activity. In contrast, we noted that SV40 large T promoted A31 agar colony formation when present over a 5- to 7.5-fold concentration range. However, at the low end of the spectrum, its transforming effect was manifest inefficiently except in the presence of t. Thus a major role for t in the SV40 transforming mechanism is to enhance directly or indirectly the transforming function of T.","Bikel, I;Montano, X;Agha, M E;Brown, M;McCormack, M;Boltax, J;Livingston, D M"

A panel of target cells was obtained by the double transfection and expression of a retrovirus gene and a foreign H-2 gene in recipient mouse fibroblasts. Our results show that class I H-2 transplantation antigens have a directive influence in determining the antigenicity of proteins encoded by the gag and env MuLV genes. Genes not linked to H-2 influence the intensity and the specificity of the cytolytic T lymphocyte response to Gross MuLV-induced tumors. Finally, MuLV-induced antigens expressed by transfected fibroblasts induce tumor immunity and lead to accelerated tumor rejection in vivo.","Plata, F;Langlade-Demoyen, P;Abastado, J P;Berbar, T;Kourilsky, P"
3026634,1987,Cell,Fibronectin-degrading proteases from the membranes of transformed cells.,"The local degradation of fibronectin substrata by Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryonic fibroblasts requires cell-contact-related metalloendoprotease and serine-protease activities. Using fibronectin-containing SDS gels, two large proteases with apparent molecular weights of 120K and 150K were found only in the membrane fraction of transformed cells and were absent in normal cells. Both 120K and 150K proteases were active at neutral pH, but showed preferential inhibitor sensitivities of serine and metal proteases, respectively. The 150K protease appeared to account for most of the proteolytic activity since metalloendoprotease inhibitors completely blocked proteolytic activity of the 150K in fibronectin gels, more than 80% of the fibronectin-degrading activity of solubilized membranes, and largely suppressed the appearance of fibronectin degradation spots in cultures of transformed cells.","Chen, J M;Chen, W T"

F-MuLV induced hemolytic anemia with increased levels of erythropoiesis, which was detectable as early as 13 days of age, whereas blocked erythroid differentiation, associated with erythroleukemia, was apparent only after 30 days of age. Using strains of Friend-MuLV with different virulences, we constructed recombinant viruses that allowed us to map the hemolytic effect and the ability to induce rapid erythroleukemia to different regions of the viral genome. Moreover, the ability of the virus to induce rapid erythroleukemia appeared to be independent of the presence of severe early hemolytic anemia.","Sitbon, M;Sola, B;Evans, L;Nishio, J;Hayes, S F;Nathanson, K;Garon, C F;Chesebro, B"
3022942,1986,Cell,The structure of the termini of the Epstein-Barr virus as a marker of clonal cellular proliferation.,"The linear virion form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has variable numbers of direct tandem 500 bp repeats at each terminus. The terminal restriction endonuclease fragments and the fused terminal fragments in the intracellular episomal form are heterogeneous in size, and vary by increments of 500 bp. The structure of the termini of EBV in carcinomas of the nasopharynx and the parotid gland was compared with the EBV termini in monoclonal and polyclonal tissues or cell lines. A single band representing the EBV joined termini was detected in each of the carcinomas and in the monoclonal lymphoid proliferations. Polyclonal cell lines contained multiple forms of the joined termini. The detection of a homogeneous episomal population suggests that EBV-associated epithelial malignancies are clonal expansions of a single EBV-infected progenitor cell.","Raab-Traub, N;Flynn, K"

We show that the NORM-2 antibody recognizes an integral 83 kd glycoprotein that is mobile in the plane of the plasma membrane of B16 melanoma cells. Expression of the glycoprotein is reduced under conditions that inhibit B16 growth, such as low serum, high cell density, and addition of transforming growth factor-beta. The glycoprotein reappears during S phase, when growth-arrested cells are restimulated. The NORM-2 antigen appears to be involved in growth regulation of B16 melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.","Wieland, I;Müller, G;Braun, S;Birchmeier, W"

We show here that overexpression of the N-myc gene in a rat neuroblastoma cell line following gene transfer causes down-modulation of class I histocompatibility antigen expression and increases in the in vivo growth rate and metastatic ability of these cells. N-myc-mediated down-modulation of MHC class I antigen expression could be reversed by treatment with interferon without affecting the steady state level of N-myc mRNA. No effect on MHC class I antigen expression was found when the N-myc gene was expressed in rat fibroblasts, indicating that some of the effects caused by N-myc gene amplification are cell-type-specific.","Bernards, R;Dessain, S K;Weinberg, R A"
2877744,1986,Cell,A glia-derived neurite promoting factor with protease inhibitory activity belongs to the protease nexins.,"A glia-derived neurite promoting factor (GdNPF) has serine protease inhibitory activity and in addition regulates the migration of neuronal cells. cDNA cloning of GdNPF is necessary for studying the physiological relevance and the mode of action of this protein and similar cell-derived protease inhibitors. Xenopus oocytes injected with rat glioma cells mRNA release this inhibitor. A rat cDNA clone coding for the previously purified glia-derived neurite promoting factor (GdNPF) was isolated upon hybridization-selected translation, followed by immunoprecipitation. The correct identity of this cDNA is proven by the presence of a sequence coding for a tryptic fragment from pure GdNPF. Northern analysis indicates that GdNPF mRNA is found almost exclusively in brain tissue and could be developmentally regulated. The same cDNA clone has been used to isolate full-length rat and human GdNPF cDNA. The deduced human GdNPF amino acid sequence indicates that the protein is a member of a family of cell-derived protease inhibitors named protease nexins.","Gloor, S;Odink, K;Guenther, J;Nick, H;Monard, D"
3022933,1986,Cell,Tumor invasion through the human amniotic membrane: requirement for a proteinase cascade.,"To understand the role of proteinases in tumor invasion, the effects of inhibitors of metallo-, serine-, and cysteine-proteinases on this process were studied using 125I-iododeoxyuridine-labeled B16/BL6 cells grown on human amnion basement membrane. Cellular invasion was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity associated with the amniotic membrane after the B16/BL6 cells on the basement membrane were removed by lysis followed by scraping. The results obtained with proteinase inhibitors showed that inhibitors of collagenase and plasmin prevented invasion of the amnion. Tissue invasion was also blocked by antiurokinase antibodies. On the contrary, cysteine-proteinase inhibitors and anti-tissue plasminogen activator antiserum were ineffective. Mersalyl, a compound known to activate collagenase, stimulated invasion under conditions where plasmin formation or activity were inhibited. Evidence for the role of a plasminogen activator-plasmin-collagenase activation cascade in B16 invasion is provided.","Mignatti, P;Robbins, E;Rifkin, D B"
3768959,1986,Cell,Chromosomal position or virus mutation permits retrovirus expression in embryonal carcinoma cells.,"Retrovirus expression is restricted in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. To study how a virus can overcome this block, we selected and analyzed rare proviruses that are expressed in F9 cells. Our results indicate that provirus expression occurs by two different mechanisms: one provirus acquired a single base pair mutation in the retrovirus tRNA primer binding site, permitting provirus expression; expression of three proviruses was mediated by 5'-flanking DNA sequences. Surprisingly, five proviruses in 17 selected cell lines integrated into the same two distinct chromosomal regions, suggesting that the number of chromosomal positions in the cellular genome that allows virus expression is very limited. Our results suggest that genomic sequences that are actively transcribed in EC cells can be isolated by selection for retrovirus expression.","Barklis, E;Mulligan, R C;Jaenisch, R"
3093082,1986,Cell,The c-myc oncogene perturbs B lymphocyte development in E-mu-myc transgenic mice.,"Transgenic mice bearing a c-myc oncogene subjugated to the lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E mu) develop clonal B lymphoid malignancies, but most young E mu-myc mice lack malignant clones. Their prelymphomatous state has allowed us to examine how constitutive c-myc expression influences B cell development. We find that early stages are overrepresented, even before birth. Pre-B cells of polyclonal origin increase greatly, while B cells develop in reduced number. Both the pre-B and the B cells appear to be in an active state, since they are larger than normal and a greater fraction are in the cell cycle. Enforced myc expression has thus favored proliferation over maturation. Hence, a normal function of c-myc may be to regulate differentiation as well as to promote cell cycling.","Langdon, W Y;Harris, A W;Cory, S;Adams, J M"
3019565,1986,Cell,Production of hepatitis B virus by a differentiated human hepatoma cell line after transfection with cloned circular HBV DNA.,"Closed-circular HBV DNA was introduced into cells of the established human hepatoma culture HepG2. The culture medium of one of 40 single-cell clones contained HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), core-related antigens (HBc/eAg), and HBV DNA sequences. HBV DNA and DNA polymerase activity were detected in particles resembling both nucleocapsids and complete virions (Dane particles). Intracellular integrated and extrachromosomal HBV DNA sequences were detected. Relaxed-circular and single-stranded forms of viral DNA were identified as likely replicative intermediates of the HBV genome. In conclusion, in vitro production of Dane-like particles by transformed human hepatocytes has been achieved. This model should be valuable as a cell culture system for studying virus replication and virus-host cell interactions.","Sureau, C;Romet-Lemonne, J L;Mullins, J I;Essex, M"

Nucleotide sequence analyses showed that the 6 kb bcl-2 mRNA potentially encodes a 26 kd protein that is homologous to a predicted Epstein-Barr virus protein. Most t(14;18) translocation breakpoints cluster within a narrow region of a 5.4 kb exon that contains a long 3'-untranslated region of the bcl-2 mRNA. As a result of t(14;18) translocation, hybrid bcl-2/immunoglobulin heavy chain transcripts are produced that consist of the 5' half of the bcl-2 mRNA fused to a ""decapitated"" immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA. Nucleotide sequence analyses confirmed that the hybrid transcripts continue to encode a normal bcl-2 protein. Our results suggest that t(14;18) translocations alter expression of the bcl-2 gene both by transcriptional activation and by abnormal posttranscriptional regulation of bcl-2 mRNA.","Cleary, M L;Smith, S D;Sklar, J"
3019559,1986,Cell,A retrovirus vector expressing the putative mammary oncogene int-1 causes partial transformation of a mammary epithelial cell line.,"In mammary tumors induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), the int-1 gene is frequently activated by adjacent proviral insertions and is thereby strongly implicated in tumorigenesis. To seek a direct biological effect of int-1 that would validate its proposed role as an oncogene, we constructed a retrovirus vector containing the gene and examined its effects on tissue culture cells. Expression of int-1 in a mammary epithelial cell line caused striking morphological changes, unrestricted growth at high cell density, and focus formation on a monolayer, although the cells were not tumorigenic in vivo. This partial transformation induced by int-1 was not observed in cells infected by an otherwise identical virus bearing a frameshift mutation in the gene. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that int-1 plays a functional role in MMTV-induced mammary tumorigenesis.","Brown, A M;Wildin, R S;Prendergast, T J;Varmus, H E"
2944600,1986,Cell,An adenovirus E1a protein region required for transformation and transcriptional repression.,"The adenovirus E1a region encodes two closely related gene products: 243 and 289 amino acid phosphoproteins. These proteins differ in their primary sequence only by 46 amino acids unique to the 289 amino acid protein. By constructing single-base substitution mutants we localized two functional regions of these E1a proteins: one required for efficient transcriptional activation, another required for efficient transcriptional repression. The 289 amino acid protein contains both regions and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional activator. The 243 amino acid protein lacks the transcriptional activation domain and appears to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor. Mutations within a highly conserved region define a novel class of transformation-defective mutants. These mutant E1a proteins can still efficiently activate transcription of early viral and cellular genes but cannot repress transcription of target genes. The fact that viral transformation may require a transcriptional repression function provides new insights into the mechanism by which adenovirus transforms cells.","Lillie, J W;Green, M;Green, M R"
2874888,1986,Cell,Analysis of the transforming potential of the human homolog of mos.,"The human homolog, c-moshu, of the mouse cellular mos proto-oncogene (c-mosmu) transforms NIH 3T3 cells at low efficiency. Furthermore, the c-moshu-induced foci are less distinct, and transformed cells contain a high level of human mos protein. The transforming activity of hybrid mos genes derived from human and mouse sequences reveals three domains within the coding region, as well as a negative regulatory sequence upstream from the c-moshu ORF that reduces its transforming efficiency. The mos C-terminal region, however, which contains the src-kinase homology domain, appears to have the greatest influence on transforming efficiency. The low transforming efficiency of c-moshu may provide a selective advantage to the host, but it also may indicate a reduced or modified function of mos in humans.","Blair, D G;Oskarsson, M K;Seth, A;Dunn, K J;Dean, M;Zweig, M;Tainsky, M A;Vande Woude, G F"
2874887,1986,Cell,Hydrophilic anchor-deficient Thy-1 is secreted by a class E mutant T lymphoma.,"To investigate the mechanism of glycophospholipid anchoring of the surface antigen Thy-1, we have undertaken a comparative biosynthetic study using a wild-type Thy-1+ murine T lymphoma (BW5147) and a mutant T lymphoma (class E) that synthesizes Thy-1 but fails to express it on the plasma membrane. Labelling experiments with D-[2-3H]mannose demonstrate that, unlike the wild type, the mutant cells are secreting large amounts of Thy-1 and that the secreted molecules are hydrophilic. Moreover, unlike the wild type, they fail to incorporate [3H]palmitic acid into Thy-1. Both wild-type and mutant cells do incorporate labeled galactose and fucose into Thy-1. We conclude that the lack of surface expression of Thy-1 by this mutant results from the failure to add anchor components to Thy-1.","Fatemi, S H;Tartakoff, A M"
3015420,1986,Cell,The primary structure of the putative oncogene pim-1 shows extensive homology with protein kinases.,"We have shown previously that the putative oncogene pim-1 is frequently activated by provirus insertion in murine leukemia virus-induced T cell lymphomas. Here we describe the structure of the pim-1 gene as determined by sequencing genomic and cDNA clones. The gene has an open reading frame, encoding a protein of 313 amino acids, extending over six exons and preceded and followed by stop codons in all reading frames. Proviruses always integrate outside the protein-encoding domain, showing a high preference for a small region in the 3'-terminal exon; integration in the 3' exon results in relatively high levels of pim-1 mRNA. Computer search reveals homology between pim-1 and protein kinases: all the domains characteristic of protein kinases are conserved in the pim-1 amino acid sequence. The highest homologies were observed with the protein-serine kinases.","Selten, G;Cuypers, H T;Boelens, W;Robanus-Maandag, E;Verbeek, J;Domen, J;van Beveren, C;Berns, A"
3015415,1986,Cell,v-ras genes from Harvey and BALB murine sarcoma viruses can act as initiators of two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis.,"Activated Harvey murine sarcoma virus ras genes were introduced into epidermal cells in vivo by direct application of retroviruses to mouse skin. Subsequent treatment with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced benign papillomas, some of which progressed to invasive carcinomas. Initiation with virus was irreversible for at least 4 months, since TPA treatment after this latency period produced papillomas within 4 weeks. Analysis of viral integration sites showed that carcinomas are clonal in origin. Both papillomas and carcinomas express virus-specific ras mRNA and the viral form of ras P21 protein. The results show that activated ras genes can replace chemical carcinogens in initiation of mouse skin carcinogenesis. This system presents a novel approach to in vivo analysis of the biological role of oncogenes in epithelial tumorigenesis.","Brown, K;Quintanilla, M;Ramsden, M;Kerr, I B;Young, S;Balmain, A"
3459590,1986,Cell,Expression in rat fibroblasts of a human transforming growth factor-alpha cDNA results in transformation.,"Acquisition of the ability to produce and respond to a growth factor may result in increased cellular proliferation and could lead to malignant transformation. The fact that a large variety of tumor cells secrete transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) suggests involvement of TGF-alpha in cellular transformation and provides supporting evidence for the autocrine stimulation model. In order to determine directly the role of TGF-alpha in tumorigenicity, we introduced a human TGF-alpha cDNA expression vector into established nontransformed Fischer rat fibroblast (Rat-1) cells. Synthesis and secretion of human TGF-alpha by these cells results in the loss of anchorage-dependent growth and induces tumor formation in nude mice.

The high specificity and anticatalytic nature of the antibody has allowed probing of the direct role of PA in cellular behavior. Microgram quantities of monoclonal IgG inhibit the overgrowth and the morphological changes associated with RSVCEF transformation and the degradation of extracellular matrix mediated by RSVCEF, indicating a catalytic role for PA in these cellular processes. Specific cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins by immunoaffinity-purified PA in the complete absence of plasminogen demonstrates a direct catalytic involvement of PA in matrix degradation.","Sullivan, L M;Quigley, J P"

A DNA rearrangement in the 5' noncoding sequence, which occurred during transfection, is probably responsible for activation of the mas gene. The cDNA sequence of the mas oncogene reveals a long open reading frame that codes for a 325 amino acid protein. This protein is very hydrophobic and has seven potential transmembrane domains. In this respect, the structure of the mas protein is novel among cellular oncogene products and may reflect a new functional class of oncogenes.","Young, D;Waitches, G;Birchmeier, C;Fasano, O;Wigler, M"
3011276,1986,Cell,Autocrine saturation of pro-urokinase receptors on human A431 cells.,"Single-chain pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) is present both in the medium and lysate of the A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Most of the cell-associated pro-uPA is on the cell surface, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence and by surface iodination. Pro-uPA is not an integral membrane protein but is bound to a specific surface receptor that is completely saturated. A mild acid treatment uncovers the surface receptors by dissociating pro-uPA. Resaturation of uncovered receptors has been studied by reincubating cells in normal medium; within 40 min, 50% of the free sites are reoccupied. Excess uPA-specific antibodies prevent rebinding of ligand to the receptors. Thus, A431 cells first secrete uPA, which then binds to the surface receptor. We propose that the synthesis of uPA and uPA receptor by the same cell may provide a pathway for the activation of the metastatic potential of malignant cells.","Stoppelli, M P;Tacchetti, C;Cubellis, M V;Corti, A;Hearing, V J;Cassani, G;Appella, E;Blasi, F"
2871941,1986,Cell,Multiple independent activations of the neu oncogene by a point mutation altering the transmembrane domain of p185.,"The neu oncogene, which is frequently activated in neuro- and glioblastomas of BDIX rats, was originally identified in the NIH 3T3 focus-forming assay. cDNA clones of the normal and transforming alleles of neu have been isolated. When these clones are inserted into the expression vector pSV2, they direct the synthesis of p185, the neu gene product. The transforming cDNA clone yields foci when transfected onto a NIH 3T3 monolayer, but the normal cDNA does not. The construction of in vitro recombinants between the normal and transforming cDNAs has allowed the determination of the mutation responsible for the activation of the neu proto-oncogene. A single point mutation changes a valine in the transmembrane domain of the predicted protein product insert to a glutamic acid. The DNAs from four independent cell lines containing activated neu oncogenes contain the identical mutation at this position.","Bargmann, C I;Hung, M C;Weinberg, R A"
3011271,1986,Cell,Consequences of widespread deregulation of the c-myc gene in transgenic mice: multiple neoplasms and normal development.,"We have constructed a transgenic mouse strain in which a mammary tumor virus LTR/c-myc fusion gene is anomalously expressed in a wide variety of tissues. The deregulated c-myc transgene, now glucocorticoid inducible, contributes to an increased incidence of a variety of tumors, including those of testicular, breast, lymphocytic (B cell and T cell), and mast cell origin. The deregulated gene does not, however, otherwise disturb cell proliferation, nor does it interfere with normal development in these animals. Moreover, since not all tissues that express the transgene develop neoplasms, these results begin to define the transforming spectrum of the c-myc oncogene. They also extend to several organ systems the notion that elements in addition to an activated c-myc gene are required to induce malignancy in the living organism.","Leder, A;Pattengale, P K;Kuo, A;Stewart, T A;Leder, P"
3698101,1986,Cell,v-mil induces autocrine growth and enhanced tumorigenicity in v-myc-transformed avian macrophages.,"MH2, an avian retrovirus containing the v-myc and v-mil oncogenes, rapidly transforms chick hematopoietic cells in vitro. The transformed cells belong to the macrophage lineage and proliferate in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Here we analyze a series of MH2 deletion mutants and show that these two oncogenes together establish an autocrine growth system in which v-myc stimulates cell proliferation, while v-mil induces the production of chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF). We also demonstrate that these two oncogenes cooperate in vivo. MH2 efficiently induces monocytic leukemias and liver tumors, while deletion mutants lacking either a functional v-mil or v-myc do not.","Graf, T;von Weizsaecker, F;Grieser, S;Coll, J;Stehelin, D;Patschinsky, T;Bister, K;Bechade, C;Calothy, G;Leutz, A"
3009024,1986,Cell,v-erbA cooperates with sarcoma oncogenes in leukemic cell transformation.,"The v-erbB, v-src, v-fps, v-sea, and v-Ha-ras oncogenes induce avian erythroid progenitor cells to self-renew in an erythropoietin-independent manner. These transformed erythroblasts retain both their capacity to differentiate into erythrocytes and their requirement for complex growth media. However, previous studies showed that erythroblasts transformed by v-erbB plus v-erbA (which by itself is not oncogenic) are blocked in differentiation and grow in standard media. Here we show that the introduction of v-erbA into erythroblasts transformed with v-src, v-fps, v-sea, or v-Ha-ras likewise induces a fully transformed phenotype. It also reduces the capacity of ts sea- and ts erbB-transformed erythroblasts to differentiate terminally in an erythropoietin-dependent manner after a temperature shift. Cooperativity involving v-erbA also occurs in vivo since chicks infected with a retroviral construct encoding v-erbA and v-src develop both acute erythroblastosis and sarcomas.","Kahn, P;Frykberg, L;Brady, C;Stanley, I;Beug, H;Vennström, B;Graf, T"
3006923,1986,Cell,Rous sarcoma virus transforming protein lacking myristic acid phosphorylates known polypeptide substrates without inducing transformation.,"Mutagenesis of glycine 2 of p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), yields a protein that is neither myristylated nor bound to cellular membranes. Although these mutant viruses retain full tyrosine protein kinase activity, they are transformation-defective. We examined in detail tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular polypeptides and the phenotype induced by infection with two such viruses. Infection failed to cause growth in agar, cytoskeletal reorganization, or changes in fibronectin synthesis and protease secretion. Strikingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of the known substrates of p60src was extensive, and differed from that found in wild-type transformed cells only quantitatively. There was no apparent correlation between the extent to which any of eight known protein substrates of p60src were phosphorylated and the phenotype of infected cells. We suggest that the phosphorylation of as yet unidentified proteins, which are probably found in cellular membranes, is essential for transformation by RSV.","Kamps, M P;Buss, J E;Sefton, B M"
3004745,1986,Cell,Different localization of the product of the v-rel oncogene in chicken fibroblasts and spleen cells correlates with transformation by REV-T.,"Reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T (REV-T) is a highly oncogenic avian retrovirus that transforms early lymphoid cells in vivo and in vitro, but REV-T does not transform chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Using antisera to p59v-rel, the v-rel oncogene product of REV-T, we show that p59v-rel is expressed at equal levels and is a phosphoprotein in REV-T infected spleen cells and CEF. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence of REV-T infected nontransformed CEF show that p59v-rel is loosely associated with the nucleus. However, in REV-T transformed spleen cells p59v-rel is primarily a cytoplasmic protein. MSB-1 cells, a Marek's disease virus transformed T cell leukemic line, and E26 virus transformed myeloid cells show nuclear staining of p59v-rel when they are infected by REV-T. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between a cytoplasmic localization of p59v-rel and transformation by REV-T, and they suggest that p59v-rel cannot transform cells in which it assumes solely a nuclear location.","Gilmore, T D;Temin, H M"
3456277,1986,Cell,An intracellular factor that induces erythroid differentiation in mouse erythroleukemia (Friend) cells.,"We have previously shown that in vitro erythroid differentiation of mouse Friend cells is a result of a synergistic action of two distinctive intracellular reactions. We now have evidence that a factor in the cell free extract is involved in one of the reactions. This factor triggers erythroid differentiation when introduced into undifferentiated mouse Friend cells, provided the cells have been briefly exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide. The factor is induced in nonerythroid cells as well following treatment of the cells by agents that affect DNA replication. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of the factor. The factor, which is in the cytoplasm, was partially purified and proteinaceous. When introduced into the cells the partially purified factor converts 60% to 70% of undifferentiated Friend cells to erythroid cells, at an efficiency almost equivalent to the efficiencies achieved by typical inducing agents. The factor's biochemical characteristics and possible role in erythroid differentiation are also discussed.","Nomura, S;Yamagoe, S;Kamiya, T;Oishi, M"
3004741,1986,Cell,Ras p21 proteins with high or low GTPase activity can efficiently transform NIH/3T3 cells.,"We sought to determine whether decreased in vitro GTPase activity is uniformly associated with ras p21 mutants possessing efficient transforming properties. Normal H-ras p21-[Gly12-Ala59] as well as an H-ras p21-[Gly12-Thr59] mutant exhibited in vitro GTPase activities at least fivefold higher than either H-ras p21-[Lys12-Ala59] or H-ras p21-[Arg12-Thr59] mutants. Microinjection of as much as 6 X 10(6) molecules/cell of bacterially expressed normal H-ras p21 induced no detectable alterations of NIH/3T3 cells. In contrast, inoculation of 4-5 X 10(5) molecules/cell of each p21 mutant induced morphologic alterations and stimulated DNA synthesis. Moreover, the transforming activity of each mutant expressed in a eukaryotic vector was similar and at least 100-fold greater than that of the normal H-ras gene. These findings establish that activation of efficient transforming properties by ras p21 proteins can occur by mechanisms not involving reduced in vitro GTPase activity.","Lacal, J C;Srivastava, S K;Anderson, P S;Aaronson, S A"
3510745,1986,Cell,In vitro establishment is not a sufficient prerequisite for transformation by activated ras oncogenes.,"Activated ras genes transform REF52 cells only at low frequencies and adenovirus early region 1A collaborates with ras oncogenes to convert REF52 cells to a tumorigenic phenotype. While failure to transform did not result from an absence of ras gene expression, E1A appeared to enhance expression of transfected ras genes by approximately tenfold. However, enhanced ras expression alone does not account for collaboration by E1A since overexpression of T24 Ha-ras p21 induced morphological crisis and cell growth arrest rather than stable transformation. These results indicate that E1A contributes complementing biochemical activities that enable ras genes to transform REF52 and suggest that the role of E1A in primary cell transformation may extend beyond facilitating in vitro establishment.","Franza, B R;Maruyama, K;Garrels, J I;Ruley, H E"
2417729,1986,Cell,A frameshift at a mutational hotspot in the polyoma virus early region generates two new proteins that define T-antigen functional domains.,"A frameshift mutation, arising from the deletion of any one of nine consecutive cytidines in the region of Py DNA encoding both the midregion of large T-Ag and the C-terminal region of middle T-Ag, yields unstable flat cell revertants that synthesize two novel viral proteins in which shuffling of the different domains of the Py T-Ags has occurred. The first protein (37 kd) is a hybrid containing the N-terminus of large T-Ag and the hydrophobic C-terminus of middle T-Ag. The latter domain is responsible for membrane association, even in the 37 kd hybrid protein. The second protein (43 kd), which contains the N-terminal 75% of middle T-Ag, has an associated protein kinase activity and forms a complex with c-src, but cannot induce a transformed phenotype.","Wilson, J B;Hayday, A;Courtneidge, S;Fried, M"
3510078,1986,Cell,Biological and biochemical properties of human rasH genes mutated at codon 61.,"Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced mutations encoding 17 different amino acids at codon 61 of the human rasH gene. Fifteen of these substitutions increased rasH transforming activity. The remaining two mutants, encoding proline and glutamic acid, displayed transforming activities similar to the normal gene. Overall, these mutants vary over 1000-fold in transforming potency. Increased levels of p21 expression were required for transformation by weakly transforming mutants. The mutant proteins were unaltered in guanine nucleotide binding properties. However, all 17 different mutant proteins displayed equivalently reduced rates of GTP hydrolysis, 8- to 10-fold lower than the normal protein. There was no quantitative correlation between reduction in GTPase activity and transformation, indicating that reduced GTP hydrolysis is not sufficient to activate ras transforming potential.","Der, C J;Finkel, T;Cooper, G M"
3079673,1986,Cell,Clustering of extensive somatic mutations in the variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene from a human B cell lymphoma.,"Following treatment of a human B cell lymphoma with an anti-idiotype antibody, a subpopulation of tumor cells remained that had lost the tumor-specific heavy chain idiotypic determinant. Nucleotide sequence analyses of eight independent heavy chain variable region isolates showed extensive point mutations, so that no two sequences were identical. Comparison of pretreatment and posttreatment sequences implicated an amino acid in CDR2 as being involved in the idiotypic determinant. Apparently the malignant B cells escaped the therapeutic effects of the anti-idiotype antibody through an ongoing process of somatic mutation in their immunoglobulin genes. Non-random clustering of amino acid replacements in CDR2 suggested that growth of the tumor may have been influenced by endogenous selective forces interacting with the tumor cell-surface immunoglobulin.","Cleary, M L;Meeker, T C;Levy, S;Lee, E;Trela, M;Sklar, J;Levy, R"
2416473,1986,Cell,Growth inhibition of transformed cells correlates with their junctional communication with normal cells.,"The growth of various chemically and virally transformed cell types in culture is inhibited when they are in contact with normal cell types. We show that this growth inhibition is contingent on the presence of junctional communication between the normal and transformed cells (heterologous communication), as probed with a 443 dalton microinjected fluorescent tracer. In cell combinations where heterologous communication is weak or absent there is no detectable growth inhibition; the inhibition appears when communication is induced by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, and only then. In cell combinations where heterologous communication is spontaneously strong, the growth inhibition is present, but it is abolished when the communication is blocked by retinol or retinoic acid. The cell-to-cell membrane channels of gap junctions are the likely conduits of the signals for this growth control.","Mehta, P P;Bertram, J S;Loewenstein, W R"
3935328,1985,Cell,Fusion of an immunoglobulin variable gene and a T cell receptor constant gene in the chromosome 14 inversion associated with T cell tumors.,"An inversion of chromosome 14, inv(14)(q11,q32), is frequently observed in human T cell tumors; the cytogenetic breakpoints are of interest because the T cell receptor alpha-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes reside on chromosome bands 14q11 and 14q32, respectively. We have investigated the structure of the alpha-chain genes in a T cell line harboring the chromosome 14 inversion. On the normal chromosome 14, a V alpha segment has rearranged nonproductively with a J alpha segment. In contrast, the inverted chromosome features an unprecedented rearrangement in which an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene segment (VH) on chromosome band 14q32 has joined with a J alpha segment from band 14q11. The VH-J alpha C alpha rearrangement is productive at the genomic level and therefore may encode a hybrid immunoglobulin/T cell receptor polypeptide.","Baer, R;Chen, K C;Smith, S D;Rabbitts, T H"
3878229,1985,Cell,Expression of a hemopoietic growth factor cDNA in a factor-dependent cell line results in autonomous growth and tumorigenicity.,"Production of a growth factor by a cell that responds to this factor has been termed ""autocrine"" stimulation of proliferation. Considerable experimental data have suggested that tumor cells often exhibit autocrine growth stimulation and that this may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. To experimentally approach the relationship of autocrine growth stimulation to the malignant transformation of hemopoietic cells, we have used a retroviral vector to express sequences encoding a hemopoietic growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in a factor-dependent murine cell line (FDC-P1). Virally infected cells synthesized and secreted GM-CSF, grew independently of exogenous CSF, and--unlike the parental FDC-P1 cells--produced tumors in syngeneic mice. We have thus experimentally induced autocrine growth regulation in a factor-dependent hemopoietic cell line and have shown that this results in tumorigenicity.","Lang, R A;Metcalf, D;Gough, N M;Dunn, A R;Gonda, T J"
3000618,1985,Cell,An EBV membrane protein expressed in immortalized lymphocytes transforms established rodent cells.,"Epstein-Barr virus expresses a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane protein (LMP) in latently infected growth transformed lymphocytes. The gene specifying LMP has now been expressed in NIH3T3 and Rat-1 cells. Expression of the gene in these cells resulted in altered cell morphology and some resistance to the growth inhibiting effect of medium containing low serum. In Rat-1 cells, LMP expression often led to loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Rat-1 cells expressing LMP were uniformly tumorigenic in nude mice. Thus, LMP is a transforming gene which is likely to account for many aspects of EBV induced cell transformations. This is the first demonstration of a transforming gene in Epstein-Barr virus, a ubiquitous human pathogen associated with neoplasia.","Wang, D;Liebowitz, D;Kieff, E"
2416471,1985,Cell,Pleiotropic phenotypic expression in cybrids derived from mouse teratocarcinoma cells fused with rat myoblast cytoplasts.,"Cybrid clones were isolated by fusing mouse embryonal carcinoma (PCC4) cells with cytoplasts of rat myoblastic cells (L6TG X CAPr). Although some clones were similar to PCC4 (Type II), a high proportion (88%) were differentiated; the differentiated cells had a mesh-like arrangement (Type I) or were flat with many projections (Type III). Protein patterns of both Type I and Type III cells changed markedly from that of PCC4 cells. Type III cells lacked alkaline phosphatase and expressed endo A and B proteins predominantly. One Type III clone produced alpha-fetoprotein and plasminogen activator (visceral endoderm-like), while another clone consisted of trophectodermal cell-like giant cells. Therefore it was shown that introduction of the somatic cell cytoplasm induces differentiation of teratocarcinoma stem cells, suggesting a cytoplasmic element (or elements) regulating gene expression.","Iwakura, Y;Nozaki, M;Asano, M;Yoshida, M C;Tsukada, Y;Hibi, N;Ochiai, A;Tahara, E;Tosu, M;Sekiguchi, T"
2416464,1985,Cell,A lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase gene is rearranged and overexpressed in the murine T cell lymphoma LSTRA.,"Protein-tyrosine kinases are implicated in the control of normal and neoplastic cell growth. We have used molecular cloning strategies to characterize a lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase gene distinct from but closely related to src and yes. This gene, encoded by a genetic locus defined here as lskT, is rearranged and overexpressed in the murine T cell lymphoma LSTRA. Thus alterations in the structure or expression of this protein-tyrosine kinase gene may in some cases mediate neoplastic transformation. In addition, transcription of the normal lskT gene is restricted to cells of lymphoid origin. We infer that the lskT-encoded protein-tyrosine kinase may aid in transducing proliferative or differentiative signals unique to lymphocytes.","Marth, J D;Peet, R;Krebs, E G;Perlmutter, R M"
4075396,1985,Cell,Modulation of the tumorigenicity of human adenovirus-12-transformed cells by interferon.,"Human adenovirus-12-transformed cells express greatly reduced levels of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigens and are highly tumorigenic in syngeneic hosts. The finding that expression of a transfected class I gene is sufficient to abrogate their tumorigenicity underscores the importance of defining the conditions that will lead to derepression of endogenous class I genes in these cells. Brief treatment of Ad12-transformed cells with interferon results in the rapid but transient expression of class I antigens, and these interferon-treated cells have significantly reduced tumorigenicity in immunocompetent hosts. We have further demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of interferon, subsequent to the introduction of a tumorigenic dose of Ad12-transformed cells, results in complete protection against this tumor. The ability of interferon to ""induce"" class I gene expression may be an important modality in the treatment of a variety of spontaneous tumors that exhibit greatly reduced levels of class I antigens on their cell surface.","Hayashi, H;Tanaka, K;Jay, F;Khoury, G;Jay, G"
4075393,1985,Cell,Expression of homologous homeo-box-containing genes in differentiated human teratocarcinoma cells and mouse embryos.,"Human chromosome 17 contains a cluster of at least three distinct homeo box regions, Hu1, Hu2, and Hu5, within a 20 kb stretch of DNA. A mouse homeo box region, Mu1, which maps to chromosome 11, was isolated and found to contain extensive nucleotide homology with a 4 kb region encompassing the Hu1 homeo box. The conservation of these chromosomal regions between man and mouse was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis: approximately 380 bp of DNA are more than 90% homologous and the 61 amino acids of the homeo box domain are perfectly conserved. We found that a human teratocarcinoma cell line expresses high levels of Hu1 homeo-box-containing mRNA only after differentiation of the cells following treatment with retinoic acid. In contrast, mouse teratocarcinoma cells did not express Mu1 homeo-box-containing mRNA at any stage of differentiation, whereas the expression of such transcripts was detected in mouse embryos from 10 to 17 days of gestation.","Hauser, C A;Joyner, A L;Klein, R D;Learned, T K;Martin, G R;Tjian, R"
2992805,1985,Cell,"Activation of a novel human transforming gene, ret, by DNA rearrangement.","A novel transforming gene was detected by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with human lymphoma DNA. The tumor DNA induced a single focus in primary transfections, whereas DNAs of transformed NIH cells induced transformation with high efficiencies in secondary and tertiary assays. Molecular clones spanning about 37 kb of human sequence were isolated from tertiary transformant DNA. Blot hybridization indicated that the transforming gene consisted of two segments that were unlinked in both normal human and primary lymphoma DNAs. The two segments of human DNA were cotranscribed in transformed NIH cells but not in any human cells examined. The transforming gene thus appeared to be activated by recombination between two unlinked human DNA segments, possibly by cointegration during transfection.","Takahashi, M;Ritz, J;Cooper, G M"
2990723,1985,Cell,Activation of the transformation potential of the cellular fps gene.,"Chicken cellular-fps (c-fps) sequences were substituted for viral-fps (v-fps) sequences in two retroviral genome structures, one that expressed a c-fps gene product that was indistinguishable from the normal c-fps gene product expressed in chicken bone marrow cells, and another that expressed a gag-fps fusion protein. When c-fps gene sequences (without linked gag gene sequences) were expressed at high levels in a viral vector, no transformation of fibroblasts was detected. It was previously demonstrated that the corresponding v-fps sequences could transform fibroblasts. When the same c-fps sequences were expressed in a form linked to gag gene sequences, transformation of fibroblasts and induction of tumors were observed. The data suggest that the c-fps gene product lacks transformation potential by itself even when overexpressed and that the transformation potential of the c-fps gene can be activated by either mutation (or mutations) in the fps coding region or by fusion with viral gag gene sequences.","Foster, D A;Shibuya, M;Hanafusa, H"
3924412,1985,Cell,Cloning the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18) human lymphomas: clustering around JH on chromosome 14 and near a transcriptional unit on 18.,"Specific chromosomal translocations found in distinct neoplasms suggest that genes that flank such breakpoints play a critical role in transformation. We have characterized the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation present in over 60% of human follicular lymphomas. We exploited an unexpected rearrangement of an Ig heavy-chain gene to clone the chromosomal breakpoint. An element isolated from 18q21 mediated translocations in all four t(14;18) bearing cell lines and in six of 11 follicular lymphomas, but did not normally rearrange in other B or non-B cells. The breakpoints clustered within a small 4.3 kb region on chromosome 18. The breakpoints on chromosome 14 were focused within or immediately 5' to JH. These breakpoints retained the Ig enhancer region close to a new transcriptional unit identified on chromosome segment 18q21. Since none of the cellular oncogenes are known to map to 18q21, cloning this element provides an opportunity to characterize a potentially new transforming gene.","Bakhshi, A;Jensen, J P;Goldman, P;Wright, J J;McBride, O W;Epstein, A L;Korsmeyer, S J"
2988784,1985,Cell,c-erbB activation in ALV-induced erythroblastosis: novel RNA processing and promoter insertion result in expression of an amino-truncated EGF receptor.,"ALV-induced erythroblastosis results from the specific interruption of the host oncogene, c-erbB, by the insertion of an intact provirus. Integrated proviruses are oriented in the same transcriptional direction as c-erbB, and expression of truncated c-erbB transcripts is observed. Evidence, including sequence analysis of cDNA clones, indicates that transcription of truncated c-erbB mRNA is initiated in the 5' LTR of the integrated provirus. This transcript is processed through a series of remarkable splicing reactions to yield viral gag and env sequences fused to erbB sequences. These results establish a novel pathway of promoter insertion oncogenesis that stands in contrast to the pathways used in the activation of c-myc in B lymphomas.","Nilsen, T W;Maroney, P A;Goodwin, R G;Rottman, F M;Crittenden, L B;Raines, M A;Kung, H J"
2988783,1985,Cell,Neoplastic transformation of mast cells by Abelson-MuLV: abrogation of IL-3 dependence by a nonautocrine mechanism.,"Normal mast cells can be propagated in culture when medium is supplemented with interleukin-3 (IL-3). We demonstrate that Abelson-MuLV (Ab-MuLV) infection of mast cells eliminates dependence on IL-3 for growth. By contrast, Harvey, BALB, and Moloney MSV, which also productively infect mast cells, are unable to relieve IL-3 dependence. Ab-MuLV-induced IL-3-independent lines express the v-abl-specific transforming protein and have phenotypic characteristics of mast cells. These cells also possess high cloning efficiencies in soft agarose and are tumorigenic in nude mice. In addition, Ab-MuLV induces transplantable mastocytomas in pristane-primed adult mice resistant to lymphoid transformation, defining a new hematopoietic target for malignant transformation by this virus. None of the Ab-MuLV-derived transformants express or secrete detectable levels of IL-3 nor is their growth inhibited by anti-IL-3 serum. These results argue that Ab-MuLV abrogation of the IL-3 requirement is not due to an autocrine mechanism.","Pierce, J H;Di Fiore, P P;Aaronson, S A;Potter, M;Pumphrey, J;Scott, A;Ihle, J N"
2988782,1985,Cell,Malignant transformation of a growth factor-dependent myeloid cell line by Abelson virus without evidence of an autocrine mechanism.,"Abelson virus has been used to transform cells of a murine, factor-dependent myeloid cell line (FD). Factor-independent (FI) cell lines were derived, which expressed the viral genome and were tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. Karyotypic analysis of FI cells before and after passage in vivo indicated that the tumorigenic cells were derived from FD cells. Northern gel analysis of mRNA, bioassay of culture supernatants, and the density-independent growth of the FI cells indicated that the transformation had not induced the synthesis of the hemopoietic growth factors normally required to support the FD cells, that is, granulocyte-macrophage CSF or Multi-CSF. The FD and FI cells displayed similar numbers of cell surface receptors for Multi-CSF (IL-3) and GM-CSF. We conclude that Abelson virus transformation of this line from factor-dependence to factor-independence and tumorigenicity did not involve autocrine stimulation.","Cook, W D;Metcalf, D;Nicola, N A;Burgess, A W;Walker, F"
2860972,1985,Cell,Down-modulation of an oncogene protein product and reversion of the transformed phenotype by monoclonal antibodies.,"Exposure of neu-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to monoclonal antibodies reactive with the neu gene product, p185, results in the rapid and reversible loss of both cell-surface and total cellular p185. Although not directly cytotoxic, monoclonal anti-p185 antibody treatment causes neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to revert to a nontransformed phenotype, as determined by anchorage-independent growth. Isotype matched control antibodies of an unrelated specificity do not affect p185 levels or colony formation in soft agar by neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Soft agar colony formation by NIH 3T3 cells transformed by ras oncogenes is not affected by anti-p185 antibody treatment. Anchorage-independent growth of cells from the ethylnitrosourea-induced rat neuroblastoma line in which neu was originally detected by DNA transfection is also inhibited in the presence of anti-p185 monoclonal antibodies. Collectively, these results suggest that p185 is required to maintain transformation induced by the neu oncogene.","Drebin, J A;Link, V C;Stern, D F;Weinberg, R A;Greene, M I"

Addition of vanadate to the culture medium of NRK-1 cells resulted in a maximal 40-fold increase in the level of phosphotyrosine in cell protein. Also, vanadate induced transformation as evidenced by four criteria: generation of a highly refractile morphology, decreased density-dependent growth inhibition, increased rates of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, and growth in the absence of a solid support. The effects were dose-dependent and reversible, and similar effects were seen in two other cell lines and in secondary mouse embryo fibroblasts. Vanadate did not appear to induce increased rates of phosphatidylinositol turnover in exponentially growing transformed cells.","Klarlund, J K"
2985286,1985,Cell,Extended life span and tumorigenicity of nonestablished mouse connective tissue cells transformed by the fos oncogene of FBR-MuSV.,"We have analyzed the transforming potential of two fos oncogene products in nonestablished cultures of mouse connective tissue cells: p55fos of FBJ-MuSV and p75gag-fos of FBR-MuSV. Although both proteins induced morphological transformation and colony formation at low cell density in a G418 resistance selection assay, p75gag-fos exhibited more pronounced transforming potential than p55fos. In addition, p75gag-fos-transformed cells overcame crisis with a high probability and were tumorigenic in syngenic mice. These properties of the FBR-MuSV appear to be linked to structural alterations in the p75gag-fos oncogene product. Polyoma virus large T protein complemented the transforming potential of fos, in that it not only increased the probability of establishment of fos-transformed cells but also enhanced fos-induced morphological transformation. Our results suggest that different oncogenes affect morphological transformation, low cell density growth, establishment, and tumorigenicity to various degrees.","Jenuwein, T;Müller, D;Curran, T;Müller, R"

In NIH 3T3 cells that have been made resistant to G418 by transfection with a plasmid in which the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen promoter is linked to the neo gene, subsequent v-mos transformation causes a loss of G418 resistance. After mutagenesis of these v-mos-transformed cells, G418-resistant colonies were selected. Two of these G418-resistant mutants showed an increased expression of the neo gene and of the endogenous type I collagen and fibronectin genes, without changes in their levels of v-mos RNA or in their ability to induce tumors. The mutations might alter cellular trans-acting factors that either directly or indirectly control the expression of the type I collagen and fibronectin genes in transformed cells.","Setoyama, C;Liau, G;de Crombrugghe, B"
2986846,1985,Cell,Rearrangements of viral and cellular DNA are often associated with expression of Rous sarcoma virus in rat cells.,"Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) proviruses integrated within the DNA of transformed rat cells frequently display duplications of variable segments of proviral DNA upstream of an intact provirus. The rearrangement in the A11 clone of transformed rat cells consists of a partial duplication of both viral and cellular DNA segments whose origin is a region of approximately 4 kb encompassing the 3' virus-cell junction. Transposition of this DNA appears to have occurred at or after virus integration by a mechanism involving at least two recombination events. In every case examined, including A11, the transcriptional organization of the original provirus has been conserved and viral RNA expression appears to occur normally. The frequency of such rearranged proviruses in the DNA of transformed rat cells suggests that upstream rearrangements may influence provirus expression.","Gillespie, D A;Hart, K A;Wyke, J A"
2982498,1985,Cell,Monoclonal antibodies NORM-1 and NORM-2 induce more normal behavior of tumor cells in vitro and reduce tumor growth in vivo.,"In this study, large numbers of hybridomas (produced by syngeneic immunization with B16 mouse melanoma and fusion with NS-1 myeloma cells) were screened for the production of antibodies that affected morphology and growth of animal and human tumor cells in vitro. Two such antibodies, NORM-1 and NORM-2 (both IgG2a), inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma cells in soft agar and increased the serum requirements of tumor cells in tissue culture. Antibody NORM-2 also inhibited the growth of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells in agar and caused them to deposit more fibronectin into extracellular matrix. These antibodies thus seem to induce a more normal behavior of tumor cells in vitro. In vivo both antibodies reduced the number of growing lung tumors of B16 melanoma in C57BL/6 mice by 70%-90% when injected 3 days after the tumor cells. By immunoprecipitation of 35S-methionine-labeled cell extracts, NORM-2 antibody recognized a 59 kd protein in B16 mouse and in A375 human melanoma cells but not in 3T3 fibroblasts.","Vollmers, H P;Imhof, B A;Wieland, I;Hiesel, A;Birchmeier, W"
3855388,1985,Cell,Cellular site and mode of Fv-2 gene action.,"The Fv-2 genotype of erythroid progenitors directly determines whether they will undergo viral-induced transformation. This conclusion was reached from studies of allophenic mice compounded from congenic C57BL/6 strains differing at Fv-2 and an enzyme marker (GPI). Infection of these Fv-2ss in equilibrium Fv-2rr mosaic animals with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus results in the development of Friend disease. Concomitant with disease symptoms is a shift in the mosaic composition of the erythrocytes in favor of those of the susceptible strain. The observed viral-induced shift in the erythrocyte composition is paralleled by a similar change in the mosaic composition of the CFU-E pool but not the primitive (d8) BFU-E pool. Thus, with regard to this particular Fv-2 phenotype (susceptibility to FV-P-induced cellular hyperplasia), Fv-2 manifests itself specifically in the erythroid lineage, either in mature (d3) BFU-E or CFU-E.","Behringer, R R;Dewey, M J"
3881183,1985,Cell,Rapid induction of the expression of proto-oncogene fos during human monocytic differentiation.,"The differentiation into macrophages of the monocytic cell line U-937 or the monomyelocytic cell line HL-60 induced by phorbol esters is accompanied by a rapid induction of the expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos. Maximal levels of c-fos gene transcripts accumulate within 20-30 min following induction. By 2 hr, the c-fos-specific mRNA level drops 5 to 10 fold below that detected at 30 min after induction. The concentration of c-fos mRNA remains unchanged for the next 5 days, at which time over 99% of the viable precursor cells are converted to adherent macrophages. c-fos protein can be detected within 20 min of induction, reaching maximal levels by 40-60 min. Little or no c-fos protein is detected by 120-150 min after induction, even though c-fos mRNA remains detectable. Presence of cycloheximide leads to superinduction of c-fos mRNA transcripts. No c-fos gene transcripts are detected when the HL-60 cell line is induced with Me2SO to differentiate to granulocytes. A role for the c-fos protein is envisaged in the monocyte differentiation pathway.","Mitchell, R L;Zokas, L;Schreiber, R D;Verma, I M"
2981633,1985,Cell,Transposition of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer to the myc oncogene in a murine plasmacytoma.,"A novel mechanism of oncogene activation by transposition of a tissue-specific cellular enhancer is described. A rearranged c-myc oncogene was cloned from murine plasmacytoma ABPC17 in the expectation that it would reflect the t(6;15) chromosome translocation carried by this tumor. The rearrangement instead reflects an insertion 361 bp 5' to the c-myc gene on chromosome 15. The insert conveys a 2.3 kb segment of the immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain locus from chromosome 12. Since the insertion introduces the lymphoid-specific enhancer from the JH-Smu region and also disrupts a region implicated in normal c-myc control, it may account for the c-myc transcription observed in ABPC17. The structure of the transposed segment and a corresponding deletion in the JH-Smu region suggests that the transposition reflects a complex recombination between chromosomes 15 and 12. Since the t(6;15) breakpoint is not near c-myc, chromosome 15 must have undergone an independent exchange with chromosome 6.","Corcoran, L M;Cory, S;Adams, J M"
2981629,1985,Cell,The appearance and internalization of transferrin receptors at the margins of spreading human tumor cells.,"Using gold complexes stabilized with a monoclonal antibody specific for the human transferrin receptor, the distribution of transferrin receptors on the surfaces of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells has been mapped at high resolution. On prefixed cells and cells incubated at 5 degrees C, the receptors are predominantly within and around clathrin-coated microdomains near the free cell margin. By preincubating the cells with saturating concentrations of free antibody at 5 degrees C and warming them to 37 degrees C in the presence of the gold complexes, the appearance of new receptors in the membrane has been followed. The majority first appear near the free cell margin and then move centripetally. At first, they are monodisperse, but as they move toward the site of internalization they form loose aggregates. Within the immediate vicinity of the clathrin-coated microdomains the migrating receptors form closely packed, ordered aggregates. These observations indicate recycling transferrin receptors move to their site of internalization without cross-linking.","Hopkins, C R"
6509550,1984,Cell,DNAase I encapsulated in liposomes can induce neoplastic transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells in culture.,"We have used liposomes to deliver DNAase I inside normal Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells. We showed the entrance of DNAase I inside the cell by dose-dependent cytotoxicity; and the entrance of DNAase I into the nucleus by the induction of chromosomal aberrations and somatic mutation at the HPRT locus (but not at the Na+/K+ ATPase locus). The induction of neoplastic transformation in cultures treated by DNAase I-in-liposomes was manifested by increased saturation density, colony formation at low seeding density, colony formation in 1% serum and 0.3% agar, and tumorigenicity in 100% of injected animals. The acquisition of anchorage-independent growth became apparent only after 39-57 posttreatment population doublings. Thus damage to DNA alone can initiate the neoplastic transformation process; but for full expression of the neoplastic phenotypes, a long progression time is required for the acquisition of anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity.","Zajac-Kaye, M;Ts'o, P O"
6498938,1984,Cell,Fibroblast lines expressing activated c-myc oncogenes are tumorigenic in nude mice and syngeneic animals.,"The influence of c-myc expression on fibroblast growth and morphology was investigated by transfection of c-myc genes linked to viral promoters. No foci were observed after transfection of either NIH/3T3 or Rat 2 cells. Cell lines containing activated c-myc genes were established using SV2-neo coselection and several growth parameters of the cells were studied. The cells showed a slight increase in refractility and formed colonies in soft agar with an efficiency of only 1%-2%. The c-myc-transfected cells grew well in 0.5% serum while the controls did not. The major difference in cell growth noted was that c-myc-transfected cells were tumorigenic when inoculated into nude mice or syngeneic rats. Analysis of RNA from the tumorigenic cells showed a level of c-myc expression from the transfected genes that was 2 to 6 fold higher than that from the endogenous gene. The level of c-myc RNA in the fibroblast tumors was similar to that found in mouse plasmacytomas. Expression of the endogenous c-myc gene was unaffected by the transfected genes for subconfluent cells in culture, but the gene was shut off in the nude mouse tumors. These results demonstrate that constitutive c-myc expression leads to tumorigenicity in immortalized cell lines.","Keath, E J;Caimi, P G;Cole, M D"
6096011,1984,Cell,"Ts mutants of E26 leukemia virus allow transformed myeloblasts, but not erythroblasts or fibroblasts, to differentiate at the nonpermissive temperature.","The myb, ets-containing avian acute leukemia virus E26 transforms myeloblasts, erythroblasts, and fibroblasts in culture and causes a mixed erythroid/myeloid leukemia in chicks. We report the isolation and characterization of four E26 mutants that are temperature-sensitive (ts) for myeloblast transformation. At the permissive temperature, tsE26-transformed myeloid cells resemble macrophage precursors and proliferate rapidly, provided the growth medium contains chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF). When shifted to the nonpermissive temperature the cells stop growing and differentiate into macrophage-like cells, as determined by their expression of morphological, functional, and antigenic markers of normal macrophages. They also lose their responsiveness to cMGF and secrete a cMGF-like factor. Ts mutants of E26 retain their leukemogenicity and their ability to transform both erythroblasts and fibroblasts at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that the myb oncogene of E26 causes myeloblast transformation and that ets is responsible for erythroblast and fibroblast transformation.","Beug, H;Leutz, A;Kahn, P;Graf, T"
6096004,1984,Cell,Coexpression of a PDGF-like growth factor and PDGF receptors in a human osteosarcoma cell line: implications for autocrine receptor activation.,"The expression of both a PDGF-like growth factor and functional PDGF receptors within a clonal human osteosarcoma cell line (U-2 OS Cl 6) is demonstrated. These molecules are able to interact and induce tyrosine-specific phosphorylation and early actin reorganization in the osteosarcoma cells, effects similar to those that PDGF induces in normal responsive cells. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against phosphotyrosine revealed that a 115 kd protein was constitutively phosphorylated in U-2 OS Cl 6 cells. A phosphorylated protein of similar apparent molecular weight has been found in human fibroblasts, but only after stimulation with PDGF. These data indicate that the PDGF-receptor-dependent pathway is constitutively activated in this cell line. Extracellularly added PDGF antibodies did not, however, affect the transformed properties or growth rate of U-2 OS Cl 6 cells in vitro. This indicates that autocrine PDGF receptor activation may be insignificant for maintaining the transformed state of this tumor cell line, or that autocrine receptor activation occurs in a compartment where it is inaccessible to extracellularly added antibodies.","Betsholtz, C;Westermark, B;Ek, B;Heldin, C H"
6096003,1984,Cell,Autocrine growth induced by src-related oncogenes in transformed chicken myeloid cells.,"Chicken myeloid cells transformed by the v-myb-or v-myc-containing leukemia viruses, E26 and OK 10, respectively, require chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF) for proliferation in vitro. Upon superinfection with retroviruses carrying oncogenes of the src gene family, these myeloid cells acquire the ability to grow in the absence of exogenous cMGF. Conditioned medium prepared from superinfected E26 cells contains a growth-stimulating activity similar in biological and immunological properties to cMGF. This activity is reduced by more than 80% following absorption of conditioned media with antiserum against cMGF. Incubation of superinfected E26 cells with an immunoglobulin fraction of antiserum against cMGF inhibits their proliferation, indicating that the cells are dependent on the secreted factor. We conclude that viral oncogenes of the src family can induce chicken myeloid cells to produce a cMGF-like factor(s) that stimulates proliferation of these cells in an autocrine fashion.","Adkins, B;Leutz, A;Graf, T"
6091919,1984,Cell,Expression of the normal human sis/PDGF-2 coding sequence induces cellular transformation.,"The human sis proto-oncogene contains the coding sequence for one of two polypeptide chains present in preparations of biologically active human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A human clone, c-sis clone 8, which contains all of the v-sis-related sequences present in human DNA, was transcriptionally inactive when transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. When placed under the control of a retrovirus LTR, the clone was transcribed at levels comparable to that observed in cells transformed by SSV DNA. However, c-sis clone 8 DNA did not express detectable sis/PDGF-2 proteins and lacked biologic activity. A putative upstream exon was identified by its ability to detect the 4.2 kb sis-related transcript in certain human cells. When this sequence was inserted in the proper orientation between the LTR and c-sis clone 8, the chimeric molecule acquired high titered transforming activity, comparable to that of SSV DNA. Transformants containing this construct expressed human sis/PDGF-2 translational products. Thus the normal coding sequence for a human growth factor has transforming activity when expressed in an appropriate assay cell.","Gazit, A;Igarashi, H;Chiu, I M;Srinivasan, A;Yaniv, A;Tronick, S R;Robbins, K C;Aaronson, S A"
6091918,1984,Cell,Transforming protein of simian sarcoma virus stimulates autocrine growth of SSV-transformed cells through PDGF cell-surface receptors.,"Simian sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 (SSV-NIH 3T3) and SSV-NRK cells secrete a potent growth-promoting activity identical with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in mitogenic assays. The secreted activity is blocked by anti-PDGF antisera and competes with 125I-PDGF for receptor binding, suggesting that the secreted protein is the transforming protein of SSV, p28v-sis, or its processed product. Secreted p28v-sis appears to stimulate autocrine cell growth of SSV-transformed cells because anti-PDGF antisera block 3H-thymidine incorporation into growing SSV-NIH 3T3 and SSV-NRK cells. SSV-transformed cells have reduced numbers of high-affinity 125I-PDGF receptors; PDGF/p28v-sis receptor was purified from SSV-NIH 3T3 cells and retained active protein tyrosine kinase activity stimulated by PDGF. The rate of tumor growth in athymic nude mice injected with SSV-transformed cells was compared with levels of secreted growth factor activity. The rate of tumor growth in nude mice correlated directly with levels of p28v-sis secreted by SSV-transformed cells.","Huang, J S;Huang, S S;Deuel, T F"
6488315,1984,Cell,Biosynthesis and processing of murine T-cell antigen receptor.,"The antigen-specific receptor of C6VL T-lymphoma cells is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of 39 kd alpha chain and a 41 kd beta chain, both of which exhibit charge microheterogeneity. Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that epitopes reactive with the anti-receptor xenoantiserum #8177 were detectable by 2 min, while the clonotypic epitope reactive with monoclonal antibody 124-40 was not detectable until 10 min. Digestion with endoglycosidases H and F revealed that both subunits have at least three N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. The deglycosylated alpha and beta subunits were 27 and 32 kd, respectively. These data suggest that the dimeric receptor is formed shortly after translation, followed by extensive glycosylation. Emergence of the C6VL clonotypic epitope, and perhaps the antigen binding site, may therefore be dependent on post-assembly events.","McIntyre, B W;Allison, J P"
6488314,1984,Cell,Spontaneous mammary adenocarcinomas in transgenic mice that carry and express MTV/myc fusion genes.,"We have produced 13 strains of transgenic mice that carry an otherwise normal mouse myc gene in which increasingly larger portions of the myc promoter region have been replaced by a hormonally inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Although expression of the fusion genes varies among these animals, the female founders of two of these transgenic strains spontaneously developed mammary adenocarcinomas during one of their early pregnancies. Both the tumors and the breast tissue of these founder animals expressed RNA transcripts corresponding to the fusion gene. Furthermore, in the best studied strain, all the available F1 female progeny that inherited the MTV/myc gene also developed mammary adenocarcinomas during their second or third pregnancies. Thus, although it has no obvious effect on the early development of these mice, the constitutionally deregulated myc gene appears to act as a heritable, predisposing factor favoring the accelerated development of a tissue-specific adenocarcinoma.","Stewart, T A;Pattengale, P K;Leder, P"
6091900,1984,Cell,Enhancement of cellular src gene product associated tyrosyl kinase activity following polyoma virus infection and transformation.,"We examine the interaction between polyoma-virus-encoded middle tumor antigen and the cellular src gene product, pp60c-src, using a series of monoclonal antibodies that recognize mammalian pp60c-src. Our results show that infection of mouse cells with transformation-competent strains of polyoma virus results in the stimulation of pp60c-src kinase activity severalfold over that observed in uninfected mouse cells and mouse cells infected with transformation-deficient polyoma virus. A similar degree of enhancement of pp60c-src kinase activity was found in polyoma-virus-transformed rodent cells. No differences were detected in the level of pp60c-src synthesis in polyoma-virus-infected and uninfected mouse cells or polyoma-virus-transformed and normal rodent cells. These studies demonstrate that polyoma-virus-encoded middle tumor antigen is associated with pp60c-src in lysates of polyoma-virus-infected and polyoma-virus-transformed cells and suggest a novel mechanism for the functional activation of a cellular proto-oncogene product, namely, that the interaction between middle tumor antigen and pp60c-src leads to a stimulation of pp60c-src tyrosyl kinase activity.","Bolen, J B;Thiele, C J;Israel, M A;Yonemoto, W;Lipsich, L A;Brugge, J S"
6091899,1984,Cell,Hormonal regulation of the Rous sarcoma virus src gene via a heterologous promoter defines a threshold dose for cellular transformation.,"We have derived rat cell lines producing different and regulatable amounts of pp60v-src by introducing the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) under the control of the glucocorticoid-responsive transcriptional promoter from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We find that the cellular phenotype is strictly dependent upon the dose of pp60v-src with a distinct threshold for changes indicative of neoplastic potential. Cells with low constitutive levels of pp60v-src are not phenotypically distinguishable from cells without v-src, but as little as a 4-fold increment in pp60v-src produces morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. These properties of the transformed state are achieved at levels of pp60v-src far below levels found in an RSV-transformed cell line, without detectable increase in phosphorylation of the major cellular target for tyrosine phosphorylation.","Jakobovits, E B;Majors, J E;Varmus, H E"
6147198,1984,Cell,A genetic analysis of extinction: trans-dominant loci regulate expression of liver-specific traits in hepatoma hybrid cells.,"Extinction is an operational term that refers to the lack of expression of tissue-specific traits that is generally observed in hybrid cells formed by fusing dissimilar cell types. To define the genetic basis of this phenomenon, a series of rat hepatoma x mouse fibroblast hybrids has been isolated and characterized. We report here that the extinction of hepatic marker traits in these clones was strictly correlated with the retention of five particular fibroblast chromosomes (autosomes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13). In order to dissect this correlation into its component parts, hepatoma microcell hybrids containing single, specific fibroblast chromosomes were constructed. Hepatoma clones retaining only fibroblast chromosome 11 were specifically extinguished for liver-specific tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) expression, while expression of four other hepatic traits and of numerous constitutive markers was unaffected. Furthermore, removal of fibroblast chromosome 11 from the populations by back-selection resulted in reexpression of TAT activity to full parental levels. These data define and localize a genetic locus, tissue-specific extinguisher-1 (Tse-1), which regulates hepatic TAT expression in trans. We also provide evidence that human Tse-1 resides on the homologous chromosome (human chromosome 17), and that hybrids retaining active Tse-1 loci lack TAT-specific mRNA.","Killary, A M;Fournier, R E"
6088084,1984,Cell,Transformation mediated by the SV40 T antigens: separation of the overlapping SV40 early genes with a retroviral vector.,"A murine retroviral vector has been used to separate physically the overlapping genes encoded by SV40. This minimal retroviral vector contains LTRs and other cis-acting signals required for infectious RNA virus propagation. We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells.","Kriegler, M;Perez, C F;Hardy, C;Botchan, M"
6205764,1984,Cell,Differences in human alpha- and beta-globin gene expression in mouse erythroleukemia cells: the role of intragenic sequences.,"Human beta-globin genes introduced into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells by DNA cotransformation are correctly regulated when erythroid cell differentiation is induced by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In contrast, cloned human alpha-globin genes are efficiently transcribed in MEL cells prior to induction, and no increase in the level of alpha-globin mRNA is observed when the cells differentiate. These observations suggest that the mechanisms by which alpha- and beta-globin genes are activated during erythroid cell differentiation are fundamentally different. Analysis of the transcription of hybrid human alpha/beta-globin genes in MEL cells revealed that the sequences responsible for differences in transcription of the intact alpha- and beta-globin genes are located on the 3' side of the mRNA capping site of the two genes, suggesting that cis-acting regulatory sequences are located within the structural genes.","Charnay, P;Treisman, R;Mellon, P;Chao, M;Axel, R;Maniatis, T"

The cells form epithelia-like monolayers, which display high (greater than 1000 omega cm2) electrical resistance and a cuboidal morphology. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was found to infect the monolayer at least 100 times more efficiently when applied through the filter to the basolateral surface than when applied to the apical surface. The avian influenza, fowl plague virus (FPV), infected the monolayer through either the apical or basolateral surface. The polarity of virus budding was evaluated by harvesting virus from the two sides of the monolayer. More than 99% of released influenza hemagglutinin titre was found on the apical side of the filter, while more than 98% of budded VSV was found on the basal side. This polarity of budding was retained through 10 hr of viral infection, as was the polarity of surface expression of viral envelope proteins revealed by immunofluorescence. The strong preference of VSV for basolateral maturation is paralleled by an equally strong preference for infection through the basolateral membrane of this polar epithelial cell.","Fuller, S;von Bonsdorff, C H;Simons, K"
6088072,1984,Cell,Reversible and persistent changes in chromatin structure accompany activation of a glucocorticoid-dependent enhancer element.,"A derivative of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA, LTL, was constructed in vitro and introduced into the genome of mouse L cells. Transcription of LTL was stimulated by dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone. Two features of LTL chromatin structure are altered upon hormone treatment. First, ""moderate"" DNAase I sensitivity of the entire LTL element increases following addition of dexamethasone; this alteration persists after hormone withdrawal, when LTL transcription is shut off. Second, a discrete DNAase I-hypersensitive region is induced with a time course that closely parallels the rate of increasing transcription from the MTV promoter; this structure disappears upon hormone removal. The induced hypersensitive region coincides with a segment of the MTV long terminal repeat sequence that specifically binds purified glucocorticoid receptor in vitro and functions as a hormone-dependent enhancer element in vivo. We suggest that specific glucocorticoid receptor-DNA interactions may alter the configuration of DNA or chromatin in the vicinity of the binding sites, thereby creating an active transcriptional enhancer.","Zaret, K S;Yamamoto, K R"
6088069,1984,Cell,DNA sequences required for regulated expression of beta-globin genes in murine erythroleukemia cells.,We introduced into MEL cells rabbit beta-globin gene deletion mutants and two sets of hybrid genes constructed from the inducible human beta-globin gene and noninducible human gamma-globin gene or the murine H-2Kbm1 class I MHC gene. S1 nuclease analysis of gene transcripts before and after MEL differentiation showed that induction of the rabbit beta-globin gene did not require more than 58 bp of DNA 5' to the transcription initiation site. Hybrid genes were constructed with human beta-globin DNA sequences from either 5' or 3' of the translation initiation site linked to the complementary parts of the gamma or H2Kbm1 genes. Both types of constructs were inducible during MEL differentiation. The relative rates of transcription of the 5' gamma-3' beta and 5'H2-3' beta hybrid genes show that induction of the hybrid gene transcripts results at least in part from transcriptional activation of the genes. We suggest that DNA sequences that regulate beta-globin gene transcription during MEL differentiation are located both 5' and 3' to the translation initiation site.,"Wright, S;Rosenthal, A;Flavell, R;Grosveld, F"

The functional p53 gene in these cells has been inactivated by the insertion of Moloney virus-like sequences into the first p53 intron. Transfection of L12 cells with a functional p53 gene, contained in a 16 kb Eco RI genomic cloned fragment gave rise to L12-derived cell lines with novel p53 sequences of various sizes and copy number. A high percentage of L12-derived clones efficiently transcribed p53 mRNA and synthesized the p53 protein. Whereas injection of L12 parental cells into syngeneic mice caused the development of local tumors that later regressed, L12-derived clones that expressed p53 caused lethal tumors in syngeneic mice, thus behaving similarly to other Ab-MuLV-transformed p53-producer cell lines. These results suggest that the expression of p53 is essential for tumor cells to exhibit a fully transformed phenotype, manifested in lethal tumors in syngeneic mice.","Wolf, D;Harris, N;Rotter, V"

However, its normal cellular homolog, c-abl P150, is not detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo or in vitro. The lack of associated tyrosine kinase activity for the c-abl protein seems paradoxical since it is the c-abl-derived sequences of the v-abl protein that encode the kinase activity. We have detected an altered human c-abl protein (P210) with associated tyrosine kinase activity in the K562 leukemia cell line. K562 cells are known to have a 9:22 chromosomal translocation involving the c-abl locus and have amplified the c-able gene 4 to 8 fold. The altered P210 human c-abl is serologically and structurally related to the normal c-abl protein. A structural alteration of the human c-abl protein.

6327073,1984,Cell,Tumorigenesis by mouse mammary tumor virus: proviral activation of a cellular gene in the common integration region int-2.,"Approximately 50% of tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) contain an acquired provirus within a limited region of chromosomal DNA, termed int-2. We have extended our previous characterization of this locus and have mapped provirus integration sites in 21 independent tumors. Although integration occurs at multiple sites, proviruses within int-2 are distributed into two oppositely oriented groups whose transcription is directed away from a central domain. Provirus insertion in int-2 is accompanied by expression of RNA derived, at least in part, from this central domain. Since the RNA is not detected in normal mammary tissue, we conclude that MMTV integration activates the expression of a cellular gene within int-2 and that this event may contribute to tumorigenesis.","Dickson, C;Smith, R;Brookes, S;Peters, G"

The level of c-myc RNA was 30- 35-fold greater in tumor cells than in normal, quiescent B cells. Mitogen stimulation of the lymphocytes with lipopolysaccharide induced a 15-fold increase in c-myc expression per cell to a level that was similar to that in the transcription of the translocated c-myc gene involved initiation from sequences in the first c-myc intron. Abundant RNA transcripts were also found from the noncoding strand of the c-myc intron in most tumor lines. S1 nuclease mapping was used to locate the intronic sequences that are used to initiate the tumor-specific c-myc RNAs. Six different initiation sites within the intron were mapped, none of which have the TATA sequence usually associated with eucaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters. The noncoding strand transcripts were also found to initiate in the c-myc intron.

This Burkitt lymphoma is especially interesting because, in contrast to the more common lymphomas that carry 8;14 translocations, it carries a translocation that involves a light chain locus and occurs 3' to and at least 20 kb downstream of the c-myc gene. Furthermore, the c-myc gene from the translocated chromosome is abnormally expressed in that there is a characteristic shift in c-myc promoter utilization and an increase in c-myc transcript. These disturbances could be explained by novel structural alterations that occur in the c-myc gene and include a duplication of a 2.5 kb segment of DNA containing the two c-myc promoters and their untranslated leader exons. Interestingly, these alterations arise at a considerable distance from the translocation breakpoint.","Taub, R;Kelly, K;Battey, J;Latt, S;Lenoir, G M;Tantravahi, U;Tu, Z;Leder, P"
6327069,1984,Cell,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and VAI RNA-independent translation of influenza viral messenger RNAs in late adenovirus-infected cells.,"Influenza virus-specific proteins are synthesized at essentially the same levels in late adenovirus-infected HeLa cells as in cells not infected with adenovirus, indicating that influenza viral mRNA escapes the blocks exerted by adenovirus against host-cell mRNA expression-transport from the nucleus and translation. A significant proportion of the influenza viral mRNAs synthesized in these cells possesses the 5' ends of the major late adenovirus transcripts, resulting from capped RNA-primed initiation of influenza viral mRNA synthesis. We determined whether the ability of influenza viral mRNA to escape from the adenovirus-imposed blocks is due to utilization of the adenovirus-specific transport and translational systems because of the adenovirus 5' ends on the influenza viral mRNAs, or to establishment of influenza virus-specific transport and translational systems. Our results indicate that the second mechanism is operating, as the transport of influenza viral mRNAs from the nucleus and their translation is independent of the presence of adenovirus 5' ends. Furthermore, efficient translation of influenza viral mRNAs, but not of either adenovirus or host mRNAs, occurs in cells infected by the adenovirus deletion mutant dl331 , which does not synthesize VAI RNA ( Thimmappaya et al., 1982). Consequently, utilizing the translational machinery that had been inactivated by adenovirus, influenza virus establishes a system that selectively translates influenza viral mRNAs.","Katze, M G;Chen, Y T;Krug, R M"
6327064,1984,Cell,Chromatin structure and protein binding in the putative regulatory region of the c-myc gene in Burkitt lymphoma.,"A chromosomal myc gene displays one of three patterns of activity depending upon the arrangement of the gene and its allelic partner. In nonmalignant B cells both myc alleles are normally expressed. In Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying both a translocated and a nontranslocated myc allele, the translocated allele is inappropriately expressed, while the nontranslocated allele is virtually inactive. Here we examine the chromatin structure of these genes using DNAase I hypersensitivity in nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cells and in the Burkitt lymphoma, BL31 . Three hypersensitivity patterns emerge that correlate with the state of the gene and reveal sites associated with putative regulatory structures. One region is associated with the two myc promoters, one with a specific nuclear protein binding site, and one--which is markedly enhanced in the inactive germline gene in the Burkitt cell--with a putative negative control region. The perturbation of the normal pattern in this particular Burkitt cell may be due to the action of an immunoglobulin enhancer.","Siebenlist, U;Hennighausen, L;Battey, J;Leder, P"
6327063,1984,Cell,Transgenic mice harboring SV40 T-antigen genes develop characteristic brain tumors.,"A high percentage of transgenic mice developing from eggs microinjected with plasmids containing the SV40 early region genes and a metallothionein fusion gene develop tumors within the choroid plexus. A line of mice has been established in which nearly every affected animal succumbs to this brain tumor. Thymic hypertrophy and kidney pathology are also observed in some mice. SV40 T-antigen mRNA and protein are readily detected in affected tissues; however, SV40 T-antigen gene expression is barely detectable in unaffected tissues or in susceptible tissues prior to overt pathology, suggesting that tumorigenesis depends upon activation of the SV40 genes. Comparison of DNA from tumor tissue (or cell lines derived from tumors) with DNA from unaffected tissues reveals structural rearrangements as well as changes in DNA methylation of the foreign DNA. The SV40 genes are frequently amplified in tumor tissue, which further indicates that their expression is intimately involved in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.","Brinster, R L;Chen, H Y;Messing, A;van Dyke, T;Levine, A J;Palmiter, R D"
6722874,1984,Cell,Adenovirus VAI RNA facilitates the initiation of translation in virus-infected cells.,"The adenovirus VAI RNA is a small polymerase III-transcribed species that is required for optimal translation of mRNAs late after infection. Mutant dl331 fails to produce this RNA species and, as a result, grows poorly. Mutant-infected cells contain normal levels of late mRNAs, but reduced levels of polypeptides are synthesized late after infection. Translational elongation occurs at normal rates in mutant, as compared to wild-type, virus-infected cells. Initiation of translation occurs with reduced efficiency in dl331 -infected cells. VAI RNA is required for formation of a stable 48S preinitiation complex and very likely functions to facilitate the interaction between 43S preinitiation complex and mRNA to form the 48S species.","Schneider, R J;Weinberger, C;Shenk, T"
6609772,1984,Cell,"Activation of ras genes in human tumors does not affect localization, modification, or nucleotide binding properties of p21.","A comparison of proteins encoded by normal human ras genes and by mutant rasH or rasK genes activated in human carcinomas revealed no changes in subcellular localization, posttranslational modification, or guanine nucleotide binding associated with activation. Subcellular fractionation indicated that both normal and activated ras proteins were associated exclusively with the membrane fraction. Furthermore, both normal and activated ras proteins exhibited similar degrees of posttranslational acylation. The KD for dGTP binding was 1.0-2.2 X 10(-8) M, with no consistent differences between normal and activated ras proteins. In addition, a survey of 13 possible competing nucleotides revealed no differences in the specificity of nucleotide binding associated with ras gene activation. These results indicate that structural mutations which activate ras gene transforming activity do not alter the protein's known biochemical parameters and in particular do not affect the protein's intrinsic ability to bind guanine nucleotides.","Finkel, T;Der, C J;Cooper, G M"
6327049,1984,Cell,Murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis: integration of proviruses in a distinct chromosomal region.,"A number of mink cell focus-forming (MCF) proviruses was molecularly cloned from mouse lymphoma DNA. From each clone, flanking probes were prepared to detect common integration regions in other MuLV-induced lymphomas. One clone frequently revealed variations in the molecular structure of the corresponding region (Pim-1) in other lymphomas. The results show the following. Changes in the Pim region are seen in 24 out of 93 lymphomas tested. Over 50% of the early T-cell lymphomas show integration in the Pim-1 region. The alterations are seen in different mouse strains and with various MuLVs. The observed variations are caused by the integration of predominantly MCF genomes. All integrations occur in a region spanning less than 20 kb and are associated with the transcriptional activation of a distinct region within the Pim-1 domain. The activated region does not show any homology with 13 known and three putative oncogenes.","Cuypers, H T;Selten, G;Quint, W;Zijlstra, M;Maandag, E R;Boelens, W;van Wezenbeek, P;Melief, C;Berns, A"
6327047,1984,Cell,Murine T lymphomas in which the cellular myc oncogene has been activated by retroviral insertion.,"The myc oncogene is implicated here in T lymphocyte neoplasia. Cloning revealed a retroviral insert 0.7-1.3 kb 5' to c-myc in two T lymphomas induced by Soule murine leukemia virus and in a spontaneous T lymphoma ( Tikaut ) of an AKR mouse, a strain in which leukemogenesis involves recombinant retroviruses (MCF viruses). The tumor c-myc mRNAs appear normal but their level is approximately 5-fold higher than in most T lymphomas lacking c-myc rearrangement. Since each insert would be transcribed away from c-myc, its activation cannot involve the promoter of the long terminal repeat (LTR) but could reflect an enhancer, like that demonstrated within the Soule LTR. The Tikaut provirus has an MCF-like recombinant env gene and LTR sequence. MCF-like inserts were found near c-myc in seven of 31 other AKR T lymphomas; two lie 3' to c-myc and the five upstream are oriented away from c-myc. We conclude that a quarter of retrovirus-induced T lymphomas involve activation of c-myc, probably via the LTR enhancer.","Corcoran, L M;Adams, J M;Dunn, A R;Cory, S"
6705049,1984,Cell,Complete transformation by adenovirus 2 requires both E1A proteins.,"Rodent cells transformed by adenovirus 2 (Ad2) express two highly related viral proteins of 289 and 243 amino acids encoded in early region 1A (E1A). Transformation studies were performed with adenovirus mutants that express only one or the other E1A protein. We found that the 289 amino acid protein, which has transcription inducing activity, and the 243 amino acid protein, which has little if any of this activity, were both required to produce the fully transformed phenotype. Expression of either E1A protein induced a partially transformed phenotype. The 243 amino acid protein was particularly important for anchorage independent growth. As found in previous studies with several other E1A mutants, the process of transformation by the mutant that expresses the 243 amino acid protein only was cold-sensitive. While the 289 amino acid protein is the only E1A protein required for efficient viral replication under standard cell culture conditions, the 243 amino acid protein in addition to the 289 amino acid protein was found to be required for efficient viral replication in growth-arrested human cells.","Montell, C;Courtois, G;Eng, C;Berk, A"
6323031,1984,Cell,Translocation of the myc cellular oncogene to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in murine plasmacytomas is an imprecise reciprocal exchange.,"The 15;12 translocations in murine plasmacytomas represent recombination of the myc oncogene with the immunoglobulin CH locus, often within CH switch recombination (SH) regions. Chromosome junctions cloned from four plasmacytomas confirmed that the translocation generates reciprocal CHSH-myc and 5'myc-SH structures. H locus targets included S alpha fused to Smu, Smu fused to S gamma 2b, and a germline S alpha region. The nature of two H locus targets suggests that the target need not be highly active transcriptionally. Switch recombination machinery is implicated in the translocation by the SH targets and by homology of certain c-myc breakpoints with normal switch recombination sites. Fusion regions revealed deletions, extraneous nucleotides, and one duplication. These results prompt a translocation model in which staggered single-stranded breaks on each chromosome are followed by single-strand excision or polymerization prior to ligation to the other chromosome.","Gerondakis, S;Cory, S;Adams, J M"
6323030,1984,Cell,Temperature-sensitive mutants of avian erythroblastosis virus: surface expression of the erbB product correlates with transformation.,"The v-erbB gene of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) codes for an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein, gp74erbB. Expression of gp74erbB and its intracellular precursors, gp66erbB and gp68erbB, has been studied in cells transformed by two temperature-sensitive mutants of AEV. After shift to 42 degrees C, the processing of gp68erbB is blocked in tsAEV-transformed, but not in wtAEV-transformed, erythroblasts and fibroblasts. In addition, gp74erbB disappears from the surface of tsAEV cells within 12 hr after shift. Thus tsAEV mutants probably bear a lesion in v-erbB that affects the maturation and subcellular localization of gp74erbB. The tsAEV erythroblasts, when ""committed"" to differentiation by a pulse-shift to 42 degrees C, reexpress gp74erbB during terminal differentiation at 36 degrees C. This suggests that tsAEV erythroblasts become insensitive to the transforming functions of gp74erbB at a certain stage of differentiation.","Beug, H;Hayman, M J"
6323029,1984,Cell,Amplification and excision of integrated polyoma DNA sequences require a functional origin of replication.,"Cells transformed by Polyoma virus (Py) can undergo a high rate of excision or amplification of integrated viral DNA sequences, and these phenomena require the presence of homology (i.e., repeats) within the viral insertion as well as a functional viral large T antigen (T-Ag). To determine whether the main role of large T-Ag in excision and amplification was replicative or recombination-promoting, we studied transformed rat cell lines containing tandem insertions of a ts-a Py molecule (encoding a thermolabile large T-Ag) with a deletion of the origin of viral DNA replication. Culturing of these cells at the temperature permissive for large T-Ag function did not result in any detectable excision or amplification of integrated Py sequences. We then introduced into origin-defective lines a recombinant plasmid containing the viral origin of replication and the gene coding for resistance to the antibiotic G418. All G418-resistant clones analyzed readily amplified the integrated plasmid molecules when grown under conditions permissive for large T-Ag function, showing that these cells produced viral large T-Ag capable of promoting amplification in trans of DNA sequences containing the Py origin. These observations strongly suggest that Polyoma large T antigen promotes excision or amplification of viral DNA by initiating replication at the integrated origin, providing a favorable substrate for subsequent recombination.","Pellegrini, S;Dailey, L;Basilico, C"
6323021,1984,Cell,Detection of a molecular complex between ras proteins and transferrin receptor.,"Immunoprecipitation of extracts of human carcinoma cell lines with three different monoclonal antibodies generated against ras proteins revealed the coprecipitation of a 90,000 dalton protein. The coprecipitated protein was identified as the transferrin receptor by comigration in both reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, by absorption with a monoclonal antibody directed against transferrin receptor, and by analysis of partial proteolysis products. Coprecipitation of the transferrin receptor with three monoclonal antibodies with differing specificities to ras proteins, as well as the inability to coprecipitate the transferrin receptor from cell extracts from which ras proteins were depleted by preabsorption, indicates that ras proteins and the transferrin receptor form a molecular complex. This complex is disrupted by addition of transferrin to cell extracts. These findings suggest that ras proteins function in regulation of cell growth via interaction with the cell surface receptor for transferrin.","Finkel, T;Cooper, G M"
6697392,1984,Cell,Circles with two tandem LTRs are precursors to integrated retrovirus DNA.,"Infection of susceptible cells by retroviruses results in the synthesis of linear DNA with two long terminal repeats (LTRs), circular DNA with a single LTR, and circular DNA with two tandem LTRs. To determine which of these unintegrated molecules serves as the precursor to the provirus, we inserted into a retrovirus vector a 49 bp fragment containing the junction formed by in vivo blunt-end ligation of two LTRs. Infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts with virus recovered from this vector and subsequent characterization of the proviral DNA revealed that efficient integration can occur from this introduced junction sequence. Therefore, circular DNA with two tandem LTRs is a precursor to the provirus.","Panganiban, A T;Temin, H M"
6321038,1984,Cell,Effect of src infection on long-term marrow cultures: increased self-renewal of hemopoietic progenitor cells without leukemia.,"Long-term marrow cultures prepared from mice have been infected with a molecular recombinant of Rous sarcoma virus and murine amphitropic leukemia virus. This resulted in introduction of the src gene into the cultured cells and expression of its protein kinase function. The infected cultures displayed an altered balance in the accumulation of cells in different compartments of granulocyte differentiation. There was a dramatic increase in the stem cell (CFU-S) compartment and the committed progenitor cell (GM-CFC) compartment and a decrease in mature granulocytes. The altered balance appears to be caused by intrinsic alterations in the CFU-S and GM-CFC themselves, which increase their ""self-renewal"" capacity at the expense of cell differentiation. Remarkably, unlike its effects in other systems, src did not produce a neoplastic transformation of the hemopoietic cells.","Boettiger, D;Anderson, S;Dexter, T M"
6692471,1984,Cell,Cell-cycle control of c-myc but not c-ras expression is lost following chemical transformation.,"Cellular oncogenes are DNA sequences implicated in the genesis of cancer, but their functions in the transformation process are not understood. Our experiments provide data linking expression of two well-studied proto-oncogenes, c-myc and c-rasKi, to current knowledge of proliferation control and its perturbation by differentiation and chemical transformation. Growth stimulation of quiescent cells by serum elevates expression of the myc proto-oncogene in Balb/c 3T3 (A31) cells. In two chemically transformed A31 derivatives (BPA31 and DA31), c-myc expression is constitutive. The levels of c-myc mRNA in quiescent and growing transformed cells are nearly the same, and are only slightly elevated compared to the level found in growing A31 cells. By contrast, c-rasKi expression is cell-cycle-dependent in BPA31 cells. The relative abundance of c-rasKi mRNA begins to increase in mid- to late G0/G1. During terminal differentiation of teratocarcinoma stem cells (F9) into nonproliferating endoderm, relative mRNA abundance is diminished more markedly for c-myc than for c-rasKi. These results demonstrate that expression of the myc and rasKi proto-oncogenes is dependent upon the cellular growth state, and that growth control exhibits growth-factor-dependent, cell-cycle-timed oncogene expression. In the case of the BPA31 cells, c-myc is not rearranged, amplified, or overexpressed. However, the oncogene has lost its cycle-dependent regulation in the chemically transformed cells.","Campisi, J;Gray, H E;Pardee, A B;Dean, M;Sonenshein, G E"
6607119,1984,Cell,"Alteration of the chemotactic response of NIH/3T3 cells to PDGF by growth factors, transformation, and tumor promoters.","The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent chemoattractant for cells that respond to PDGF as a mitogen. The chemotactic response of these cells to PDGF is inversely related to their rate of proliferation, with quiescent cells exhibiting a 25-fold greater chemotactic response than exponentially growing cells. Factors that stimulate the growth of quiescent cells (EGF, FGF, PDGF, and serum) decrease the cells' migratory response to PDGF but not to fibronectin, suggesting that the decreased migration is not due to a general paralysis of cell motility. Transformed lines of NIH/3T3 cells lose their ability to respond to PDGF as a chemoattractant but can still migrate in response to fibronectin. Similarly, after treatment of 3T3 cells with the tumor-promoter phorbol myristate acetate, which induces a transformation-like phenotype, the cells no longer respond to PDGF as a chemoattractant but retain their migratory response to fibronectin. Thus it appears that the growth state of the cells can alter their migratory response to PDGF. These data suggest that growth factors, transformation, and tumor promoters specifically alter the cells' ability to respond to the PDGF-mediated chemotactic signal. It appears that both transformation and tumor promoters accomplish this by altering PDGF-binding to the cell surface.","Grotendorst, G R"
6319018,1984,Cell,The mouse c-abl locus: molecular cloning and characterization.,"The mouse c-abl gene, part of the sequence of which was captured in Moloney murine leukemia virus to generate the transforming gene (v-abl) of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, has been isolated and characterized. The c-abl locus spans 40 kb in the mouse genome with the v-abl homologies distributed in no less than ten clusters along 25 kb of the cloned DNA. Partial sequence of the v-abl homologous regions indicates that v-abl derived from c-abl mainly by splicing of multiple exons of the c-abl gene. The c-abl sequences can be subdivided into two regions: a tyrosine kinase coding sequence distributed among eight small clusters on the 5' end of the gene and a C-terminal portion consisting of one small and one large cluster, which are needed neither for the tyrosine kinase activity nor for the transforming ability of v-abl. Apparent exon/intron boundaries in the homologous kinase-coding regions of c-abl and c-src are at different locations.","Wang, J Y;Ledley, F;Goff, S;Lee, R;Groner, Y;Baltimore, D"
6319017,1984,Cell,Activation and somatic mutation of the translocated c-myc gene in burkitt lymphoma cells.,"In contrast to other human tumors in which the c-myc gene and its transcript are greatly amplified, careful analysis of t(8;14) Burkitt cell lines indicates that the c-myc transcript is marginally, and in some cases not at all, increased by comparison to control lymphoblastoid cell lines. Instead, there is a more subtle alteration in the expression of the translocated c-myc gene characterized by a shift in promoter utilization and an apparent insensitivity to the regulation that inactivates the normal c-myc allele within these same cells. In some Burkitt cell lines, such deregulation might be because of the loss of a putative control region through removal of the large dual promoter/leader segment of the c-myc gene. In other cell lines, however, this deregulation may be explained by somatic mutations that occur within the putative control region even though it is located many hundreds of bases from the translocation breakpoint.","Taub, R;Moulding, C;Battey, J;Murphy, W;Vasicek, T;Lenoir, G M;Leder, P"
6607118,1984,Cell,c-fos protein can induce cellular transformation: a novel mechanism of activation of a cellular oncogene.,"The FBJ murine osteosarcoma virus (FBJ-MuSV) induces tumors in vivo and transformation in vitro. Transformation is due to the expression of a single viral protein (p55v-fos) which is encoded by sequences derived from mouse genetic material. The homologous cellular gene (c-fos) does not transform cultured cells after introduction by transfection. We show that even though the c-fos protein is completely different from the v-fos protein at its C terminus, it is capable of transforming cultured fibroblasts. However, activation of the transforming potential of the c-fos gene requires two manipulations--a transcriptional enhancer sequence must be linked to the gene and an interaction at the 3' end of the gene, which inhibits transformation, must be disrupted. Our studies show that normal cellular protein can induce transformation when expressed in an inappropriate cell type.","Miller, A D;Curran, T;Verma, I M"
6607116,1984,Cell,New chromosomal translocations correlate with specific immunophenotypes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis from 122 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) disclosed chromosomal translocations in 36 cases. Two new nonrandom translocations were identified and found to be associated with specific immunophenotypes of the disease. The first, identified in 4 of 16 cases of T-cell ALL positive for sheep erythrocyte receptors (E+), involved the short arm (p) of chromosome 11 and the long arm (q) of chromosome 14 and was designated t(11;14) (p13;q13). The second, found in 7 of 23 cases with a pre-B-cell phenotype, involved the long arm of chromosome 1 and the short arm of chromosome 19; it was designated t(1;19) (q23;p13.3). A third abnormality involving a common breakpoint on chromosome 12 (band p 12) was also identified. These two new differentiation-specific translocations suggest a mechanism for aberrant expression of genes that influence lymphoid cell growth and development, as well as leukemogenesis.","Williams, D L;Look, A T;Melvin, S L;Roberson, P K;Dahl, G;Flake, T;Stass, S"

The two patients having no rearrangements within bcr lacked the Ph' chromosome. The highly specific presence of a chromosomal breakpoint within bcr in Ph'-positive CML patients strongly suggests the involvement of bcr in this type of leukemia.","Groffen, J;Stephenson, J R;Heisterkamp, N;de Klein, A;Bartram, C R;Grosveld, G"

This repeat identifies in mouse embryos a large number of transcripts that are quantitatively regulated during development. At maximal expression these RNAs constitute between 1% and 3% of polyadenylated RNA. A pattern of Set 1-related transcripts very similar to that observed in midgestation embryos is found in pluripotential EC and EK cell lines, and the abundance of these RNAs decreases upon differentiation in vitro.

We have used this experimental system to test whether plasminogen activator produced by the tumor is required for metastasis. Rabbit antibodies were raised against human urinary urokinase; these cross-reacted with and blocked the catalytic activity of HEp3-PA but did not inhibit chicken PA. When administered intravenously to embryos that had received an inoculum of HEp3 cells, the anti-urokinase antibodies did not inhibit tumor growth at the site of primary inoculation on the chorioallantoic membrane, but they either prevented or strongly inhibited metastasis to the embryo lung. Antibody treatment delayed the onset of pulmonary metastasis, indicating that plasminogen activator is required during early stages of the process.","Ossowski, L;Reich, E"
6317199,1983,Cell,DNA fragments from F9 PyEC mutants increase expression of heterologous genes in transfected F9 cells.,"Restrictions fragments encompassing the DNA sequence changes, which allow polyoma mutants to productively infect embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, have been coupled to the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK) gene and to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. F9 TK(-) EC cells have been transfected with the TK constructions and transformation to TK(+) colonies has been determined. F9 EC cells, retinoic-acid-induced differentiating F9 cultures, mouse fibroblasts, and mouse myoblasts have been transfected with the CAT constructions and CAT enzyme activity has been measured from the transfected cells. The results suggest that the mutant changes function at the level of gene-expression enhancement, the mutant constructions increasing the TK transformation frequency and also yielding a higher level of CAT enzyme activity when compared with constructions having no polyoma fragment or the analogous wild-type polyoma restriction fragment. The sequence specificity for enhancement changes upon differentiation of F9 EC cells, with the CAT enzyme levels from the wild-type construction approaching the values obtained from a PyEC mutant construction having a single base-pair difference.","Linney, E;Donerly, S"

However, MC29 has never been reported to cause lymphoid tumors, the disease associated with activation of the c-myc gene by the insertion of a lymphoid leukosis virus genome. We have analyzed a recovered MC29 virus, HBI, which has a myc gene containing c-myc sequences, acquired by recombination with the cellular gene, and some v-myc sequences. Inoculation of HBI into chickens resulted in lymphoid tumors independent of the bursa. Antigenically these tumors were made up of T and B cells. Molecular analysis showed HBI proviral DNA in 36 of 39 tumors analyzed, with no obvious alteration of c-myc, and the HBI gag-myc fusion protein, p 108, could be detected in tumor cells. These data are discussed in terms of the mechanism of target-cell specificity for transformation by the myc gene.","Enrietto, P J;Payne, L N;Hayman, M J"
6197179,1983,Cell,Transposition and amplification of oncogene-related sequences in human neuroblastomas.,"We have cloned a 2.0-kb EcoRI fragment of human genomic DNA (NB-19-21) which has homology to the v-myc oncogene but is distinct from the classical c-myc gene. This sequence is amplified from 25- to 700-fold in eight of nine tested human neuroblastoma cell lines which contain either homogeneously staining regions or double minutes (HSRs or DMs), the caryological manifestations of amplified genes. In the remaining line, the c-myc proto-oncogene is amplified approximately 30-fold. NB-19-21 hybridizes to a 3.2-kb cytoplasmic, poly(A)+ RNA species that is abundant only in lines in which the sequence is amplified. We propose that the gene encoding the NB-19-21-related RNA species may represent a new oncogene, which we call N-myc. NB-19-21 derives from chromosome 2; but in the five HSR-containing lines that have amplified this sequence, none has HSRs on chromosome 2. NB-19-21 is associated with DMs in a DM-containing line. A second, randomly cloned, amplified DNA segment from the HSR of one of the neuroblastoma lines is amplified in a subset of the lines in which NB-19-21 is amplified. In addition, this probe identifies a novel joint in the amplification unit of one line relative to that of the others. We suggest that, in the eight lines which have amplified NB-19-21, the amplification units are overlapping, but not identical, and that transposition of the common sequences may occur prior to amplification.","Kohl, N E;Kanda, N;Schreck, R R;Bruns, G;Latt, S A;Gilbert, F;Alt, F W"
6627391,1983,Cell,Reversal of X-inactivation in female mouse somatic cells hybridized with murine teratocarcinoma stem cells in vitro.,"A series of near-diploid embryonal carcinoma-like hybrid cells were obtained from polyethylene glycol mediated cell fusion between murine embryonal carcinoma cells (PSA-6TG1 or OTF9-63) having one X chromosome and thymocytes or bone marrow cells from female mice carrying Cattanach's or Searle's translocation. Prior to fusion with EC cells the somatic cells are presumed to contain only one active X chromosome. Following hybrid formation, the chronology of X chromosome replication and the expression of X-linked gene Pgk-1 indicated that all X chromosomes contributed by both parents were active in these hybrids. Experiments were performed to rule out the possibility that the hybrids were formed by fusion of EC cells with rare somatic cells in which both X chromosomes were active. Taken together the data indicate that within four days of fusion there is reactivation of the entire inactive X chromosome.","Takagi, N;Yoshida, M A;Sugawara, O;Sasaki, M"

These subunits are noncovalently associated with a monomorphic 20-25 kd T3 molecule. Here, we produce monoclonal antibodies to a human tumor (REX) derived from an earlier stage of thymic differentiation in order to determine whether clonotypic structures are expressed and to define the ontogeny of Ti. The results of SDS-PAGE and peptide map analyses indicate that an homologous T3-associated heterodimer is synthesized and expressed by REX. This glycoprotein shares several peptides in common with clonotypic structures on an IL-2 dependent T cell clone. In addition, similar Ti related molecules appear during intrathymic ontogeny in parallel with surface T3 expression. The latter findings provide the structural basis for the immunological competence observed exclusively within the T3+ thymocyte compartment.","Acuto, O;Hussey, R E;Fitzgerald, K A;Protentis, J P;Meuer, S C;Schlossman, S F;Reinherz, E L"
6414718,1983,Cell,The human c-myc oncogene: structural consequences of translocation into the IgH locus in Burkitt lymphoma.,"We have determined the sequence of the normal human c-myc gene and compared it to portions of a c-myc gene that has been translocated into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in a Burkitt lymphoma cell. The normal c-myc gene is encoded in three discrete exons divided by two large intervening sequences. Its mRNA is transcribed from two active promoters located about 150 nucleotides from one another. Each promoter initiates transcription of a long (approximately 550 bp) untranslatable leader sequence encoding the entire first exon. This exon and additional 5' flanking sequences are tightly conserved between mouse and man. In the Burkitt cell BL22, the rearranged c-myc gene retains both promoters and is unchanged in its amino acid coding domains. Translocation of this gene joins it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch region at a point approximately 1000 bp 5' to the dual c-myc promoters. These genes are joined in opposite transcriptional orientation. The structure of the translocated gene and the nature of its linkage to the immunoglobulin locus and the presence of two c-myc promoters and consequently two long leader sequences raise novel possibilities for the activation of an oncogene.","Battey, J;Moulding, C;Taub, R;Murphy, W;Stewart, T;Potter, H;Lenoir, G;Leder, P"
6313208,1983,Cell,Proteins encoded by v-myc and c-myc oncogenes: identification and localization in acute leukemia virus transformants and bursal lymphoma cell lines.,"We have prepared an antiserum against a synthetic dodecapeptide whose sequence corresponds to the C terminus of the MC29 v-myc protein. This antiserum (anti-v-myc 12C) specifically precipitates the known gag-myc fusion proteins produced by the defective leukemia viruses MC29, CMII, and OK10, but does not react with gag-precursor or product proteins. In addition, proteins of 62 kd and 61/63 kd are precipitated by anti-v-myc 12C from OK10 and MH2 transformants, respectively. The serum also recognizes comigrating 62 kd proteins from three chicken bursal lymphoma cell lines and from the products of in vitro translation of c-myc-specific mRNA. All of these myc-related proteins are phosphorylated and all appear to be localized in the cell nucleus. In uninfected quail cells, anti-v-myc 12C also recognizes a candidate c-myc protein of 60 kd, which does not appear to be phosphorylated and is present in low levels relative to v-myc and lymphoma c-myc proteins.","Hann, S R;Abrams, H D;Rohrschneider, L R;Eisenman, R N"
6616619,1983,Cell,Differentiation in mouse melanoma cells: initial reversibility and an on-off stochastic model.,"Various proposals that a stochastic event, ""commitment,"" is the first and rate-limiting step in mammalian cell differentiation were tested in one cell type, B16C3 mouse melanoma cells. Differentiation (pigment production) was observed in time-lapse films and in cloned single cells. As predicted by all the theories, onset of differentiation was at widely variable times in different cells after stimulation; and selection experiments showed that little of the variability was genetic. Contrary to some theories, differentiation appeared unrelated to cell division. Two properties of the melanoma cells did not fit any of the theories: times of differentiation were highly correlated in sister cells; and differentiation could be reversed in a proportion of cells, which was highest at the lowest levels of pigmentation. Dedifferentiation was associated with cell proliferation, so that most pigmented clones were small and most unpigmented clones large. These findings are accommodated by a model in which functions associated with differentiation can switch on and off, but an inhibition of the off transition builds up in the on state.","Bennett, D C"
6352050,1983,Cell,Identification and purification of a cell surface glycoprotein mediating intercellular adhesion in embryonic and adult tissue.,"An antiserum against material shed into serum-free medium by MCF-7 human mammary carcinoma cells (anti-SFM II) disrupts cell-cell interactions in murine mammary tumor epithelial cells (MMTE). We now report purification of an 80 kd glycoprotein (GP80) from SFM of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells that blocks the activity of anti-SFM II. Anti-SFM II also inhibits compaction of eight-cell mouse embryos, and purified GP80 blocks this reaction. An antiserum against purified GP80 (anti-GP80) has all adhesion-disrupting activities displayed by anti-SFM II. It recognizes one band at 80 kd in SFM and a 120 kd band in detergent extracts of epithelial but not fibroblastic cells. In immunofluorescence studies it is restricted to sites of cell-cell interaction in cultured epithelial cells. Thus a cell surface glycoprotein of 120 kd, the medium form of which is approximately 80 kd, which is neither species nor tissue specific, is expressed at early stages of mammalian development and is found on epithelia.","Damsky, C H;Richa, J;Solter, D;Knudsen, K;Buck, C A"
6311433,1983,Cell,Local mutagenesis of Rous sarcoma virus: the major sites of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of pp60src are dispensable for transformation.,"We have constructed mutants of Rous sarcoma virus expressing p60srcs that are underphosphorylated on serine or tyrosine, by linker insertion or insertion/deletion into cloned Rous sarcoma virus DNA, and recovery of mutant virus by transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts. Cells infected with mutants whose p60srcs lack the major site of either serine or tyrosine phosphorylation were morphologically transformed and formed colonies in soft agar. The tyrosine kinase activities of the mutant p60srcs measured in vivo and in vitro were close to the wild type activity. Peptide mapping showed that phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine of p60src is independent: the major phosphorylated tyrosine and the major phosphorylated serine can each be phosphorylated in the absence of phosphorylation of the other.","Cross, F R;Hanafusa, H"
6311432,1983,Cell,Activation of mouse genes in transformed cells.,"We have used molecular hybridization and cDNA cloning techniques to isolate mouse cellular genes activated in SV40-transformed cells and we show that many of the clones belong to one of four sets. We characterize the cytoplasmic transcripts and genomic sequences homologous to two of these sets. The Set 1 transcription unit(s) is activated in all SV40-transformed cell lines analyzed, and experiments with tsA-mutant-transformed lines show that activation appears to require functional large T-antigen. This transcription unit(s) is also activated in mouse fibroblasts transformed by other agents, including retroviruses and chemical carcinogens. Activation of the Set 2 transcription unit(s) is more restricted, being confined to cell lines transformed by SV40 and retroviruses with distinctive biological properties.","Scott, M R;Westphal, K H;Rigby, P W"
6193890,1983,Cell,Sequences of the A-MuLV protein needed for fibroblast and lymphoid cell transformation.,"The role of various segments (gag or v-abl) of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) genome in both lymphoid cell and fibroblast transformation was examined by deletion of areas from cloned, plasmid DNA representations of the genome. The deleted plasmids were tested by transfection into fibroblasts and by infection of bone marrow cells using virus stocks derived from the fibroblast transfectants. Deletion of gag coding sequence from the A-MuLV protein did not affect fibroblast transforming activity but abolished lymphoid transforming activity. The gag- A-MuLV genomes were very unstable in transformed fibroblasts leading to large secondary deletions in v-abl sequences. The gag- A-MuLV proteins also had lower autophosphorylation than their gag+ counterparts although cells transformed by gag- virus had a normal elevation of protein-linked phosphotyrosine. Systematic deletion of v-abl sequences showed that only 45,000 to the 130,000 molecular weight of v-abl sequence in the A-MuLV protein is needed for fibroblast transformation and, at most, slightly more is needed for lymphoid cell transformation.","Prywes, R;Foulkes, J G;Rosenberg, N;Baltimore, D"
6309409,1983,Cell,"A new avian erythroblastosis virus, AEV-H, carries erbB gene responsible for the induction of both erythroblastosis and sarcomas.","The genome structure of a newly isolated avian erythroblastosis virus, AEV-H, was analyzed. Using DNA probes specific for the LTR sequence of SR-RSV-A, and for the erbA gene and the erbB gene of the ES4 strain of AEV, we have shown that the genome of AEV-H is 35S in size and carries the erbB gene but not the erbA gene. Comparison of the restriction sites of molecularly cloned AEV-H DNA with that of cloned DNA of the associated virus revealed that the env gene of the associated virus was replaced with the erbB gene to generate AEV-H. The genome structure of AEV-H is, therefore, determined to be 5'-gag-pol-erbB-3'. Moreover, we have isolated a mutant of AEV-H, td-130, that can induce sarcomas but not erythroblastosis in chickens. The restriction analysis of proviral DNA of the td-130 showed that it carries a deletion of about 150 to 200 nucleotides in the erbB gene. These data indicate that the erbB protein is responsible for both erythroblastosis and sarcomas.","Yamamoto, T;Hihara, H;Nishida, T;Kawai, S;Toyoshima, K"
6871992,1983,Cell,Adenovirus 2 Ip+ locus codes for a 19 kd tumor antigen that plays an essential role in cell transformation.,"Adenovirus 2 large plaque (Ip) mutants produce large clear plaques on human KB cells. These mutants are shown to be defective in inducing transformation of the established rat embryo cell line 3Y1. The Ip mutation was localized within one of the two transforming early gene blocks, E1b (map position 4.5 to 11.2) which codes for two major T antigens of 53 kd and 19 kd by marker transfer. The mutational defects in mutants Ip3 and Ip5 were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis and by analysis of viral E1 proteins. These results reveal that Ip3 and Ip5 mutations map within the 19 kd tumor antigen coding region. Mutant Ip3 has a single base pair change at the N terminus of 19 kd polypeptide, resulting in the substitution of valine for alanine. Mutant Ip5 has two mutational changes, one of which results in the substitution of tyrosine for aspartic acid near the N-terminal region. The second mutation changes the termination codon into a leucine codon, increasing the size of the 19 kd tumor antigen. These results provide direct genetic evidence for an essential role of the 19 kd tumor antigen in cell transformation and indicate that the N-terminal region of the 19 kd tumor antigen is an essential function domain for the induction of cell transformation.","Chinnadurai, G"
6683594,1983,Cell,The HL-60 transforming sequence: a ras oncogene coexisting with altered myc genes in hematopoietic tumors.,"The oncogene of the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line has been passed serially through NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Oncogene-specific probes prepared from the resulting tertiary transfectants by molecular cloning have been used to show that loss of the transfected oncogene from NIH/3T3 cells correlates with reversion to nontransformed morphology. Analysis of cells transfected by the oncogenes of other tumors and tumor cell lines indicates that the transforming gene of the HL-60 leukemia cell line is closely related to oncogenes of a Burkitt's lymphoma, an acute myelogenous leukemia, an adenocarcinoma of the colon, a neuroblastoma, and two sarcomas. This oncogene is distantly related to the viral oncogenes of Kirsten and Harvey sarcoma viruses. It has been termed N-ras. The active N-ras oncogene coexists with altered versions of the myc oncogene in the HL-60 and AW Ramos human tumors. This suggests a multistep mechanism involving both ras and myc genes in the creation of these tumors.","Murray, M J;Cunningham, J M;Parada, L F;Dautry, F;Lebowitz, P;Weinberg, R A"
6307528,1983,Cell,Cellular responsiveness to growth factors correlates with a cell's ability to express the transformed phenotype.,"Five random subclones of the rat fibroblast line F2408 vary in their frequency of transformation by the unrelated Kirsten murine sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus. The same pattern of sensitivity is displayed when the cells are induced to anchorage-independent growth (transformed) by epidermal, platelet-derived, and sarcoma growth factors, or by whole serum. Our results demonstrate that a growth factor's ability to render cells anchorage independent is not unique to transforming growth factors, but common to many growth factors; anchorage-independent growth is a function of the total growth factor concentration in the medium; cells vary in their inherent responsiveness to growth-factor-induced anchorage-independent growth; and cells resistant to growth-factor-induced anchorage-independent growth are also resistant to transformation by a variety of tumor viruses. We conclude that the way a cell responds to growth factors plays a central role in the expression of the transformed phenotype.","Kaplan, P L;Ozanne, B"
6307526,1983,Cell,The 34 kd pp60src substrate is located at the inner face of the plasma membrane.,"The subcellular localization of the 34 kd protein substrate of the pp60src kinase was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. When permeabilized fibroblasts were stained with a monoclonal anti-34 kd protein antibody, a diffuse reticular pattern was observed. The 34 kd protein was not exposed on the outside surface of the cell. Double immunofluorescence staining experiments established that the 34 kd protein distribution was similar to that of the membrane-associated protein alpha-spectrin. The 34 kd protein was found in cell sections to be concentrated along the cell edges. Taken together, these results suggested that the 34 kd pp60src substrate was associated with the inside surface of the plasma membrane. This conclusion was supported by subcellular fractionation experiments in which the 34 kd protein was observed to fractionate with the plasma membrane. These localization studies support further the hypothesis that many of the primary effects of the pp60src kinase occur at the plasma membrane.","Greenberg, M E;Edelman, G M"
6307525,1983,Cell,Location and function of retroviral and SV40 sequences that enhance biochemical transformation after microinjection of DNA.,"Biochemical transformation of thymidine-kinase-deficient (TK-) mouse L cells is enhanced 20 to 40 fold when microinjected plasmid DNA contains regions of the genomes of Rous sarcoma virus or simian virus 40 in addition to the complete herpes simplex virus tk gene, irrespective of the orientation and location of the enhancer. The enhancing sequence of RSV DNA has been localized to 143 bp that include 88 bp at the 5' end of the long terminal repeat; the enhancing segment of SV40 DNA lies 42-276 bp upstream from the initiation site for early transcription. The RSV enhancer does not provide a favored integration site within microinjected plasmids and does not affect the frequency of integration into host cell DNA. When microinjected cells were grown into cell lines in nonselective medium, few cells containing integrated HSV tk without RSV DNA could grow in selective medium. In contrast, over 80% of cells from lines containing the HSV tk gene linked to the RSV enhancer could grow in selective medium. Thus the RSV enhancer affects the expression rather than the integration of the tk gene.","Luciw, P A;Bishop, J M;Varmus, H E;Capecchi, M R"
6407756,1983,Cell,Changes in malignant phenotype of a human carcinoma conditioned by growth environment.,"The human epidermoid carcinoma HEp3 exhibits highly malignant growth in chicken embryos that disappears progressively in cell culture. When studied by clonal analysis, loss of tumorigenicity was apparent within 20 generations and essentially complete after 40 generations in culture; affected all clones; and occurred under conditions which excluded the selection of variants based on superior growth rate in culture. Once ostensibly lost, the malignant phenotype reappeared after prolonged exposure of nontumorigenic cells to in vivo conditions. This similarly affected all clones assayed over a wide range of inoculum sizes. There was no evidence that HEp3 populations were heterogeneous with respect to tumorigenicity, or that the results were due to preferential selection of genetically determined subpopulations. It is suggested that the malignant phenotype of HEp3 is expressed in response to conditions in the physiological environment.","Ossowski, L;Reich, E"
6305506,1983,Cell,Tumorigenesis by mouse mammary tumor virus: evidence for a common region for provirus integration in mammary tumors.,"We have prepared specific probes for unique-sequence cellular DNA adjacent to each of the newly integrated proviruses in tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The use of such probes to screen a large number of independent mammary tumors in the BR6 strain of mouse has indicated that in at least 17 out of the 40 tumors examined so far, an MMTV provirus has integrated into a common chromosomal domain. A 10 kb Eco RI fragment of single copy DNA from this region has been isolated and partially characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. Of the proviruses located within this fragment in different tumors, all but one are complete, in the same orientation, and clustered within about 3 kb of cellular DNA. These findings are consistent with an insertional mutagenesis model for tumorigenesis by MMTV, in which the integration of a provirus in a particular region of cellular DNA may activate a neighboring oncogene. The region we describe here appears to be different from that reported for mammary tumors in the C3H strain of mouse.","Peters, G;Brookes, S;Smith, R;Dickson, C"
6305505,1983,Cell,Activation of the cellular oncogene c-erbB by LTR insertion: molecular basis for induction of erythroblastosis by avian leukosis virus.,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV), a slowly oncogenic retrovirus, induces in chickens a variety of neoplasms, including lymphoid leukosis and erythroblastosis. In lymphoid leukosis, a cellular oncogene, c-myc, is activated by the insertion of ALV LTR. We provide evidence that ALV utilizes a similar mechanism in erythroblastosis induction by activating a different cellular oncogene, c-erbB. We report the isolation, from leukemic erythroblast DNA, of a clone that represents the viral-cell junction fragment and carried the ALV LTR and part of the c-erbB locus. Restriction and sequence analyses reveal that the LTR is located upstream from the erbB coding region and is oriented in the same transcriptional direction; such a structure would be compatible with the promoter-insertion type of activation. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the multipotency of slowly oncogenic retroviruses.","Fung, Y K;Lewis, W G;Crittenden, L B;Kung, H J"
6190569,1983,Cell,Expression of c-myc RNA in bursal lymphoma cell lines: identification of c-myc-encoded proteins by hybrid-selected translation.,"We examined expression of the c-myc locus in four cell lines established from bursal lymphomas induced by avian leukosis virus. In all four lines the level of myc-related RNA was elevated. In three lines a majority of the myc-containing RNAs lacked viral-LTR-related sequences, in contrast to results obtained with primary tumors. This suggests that LTR sequences are not required for maintenance of high level c-myc expression. One line, RP9, has a complex pattern of myc RNAs containing LTR sequences, and one of these RNAs is packaged into virions. Using hybrid selection of RNAs with myc DNA, followed by in vitro translation, we detected translation of myc-related proteins from RNA of all four cell lines. The sizes of these proteins differ among the cell lines. The major polypeptides detected were 64, 57, and 54 kilodaltons. Events leading to elevation of c-myc transcription may be accompanied by alterations in mRNA initiation or processing that generate different protein products.","Pachl, C;Schubach, W;Eisenman, R;Linial, M"
6678610,1983,Cell,Regulation of fibronectin biosynthesis by glucocorticoids in human fibrosarcoma cells and normal fibroblasts.,"When treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells show changes in morphology, adhesion, and the extracellular matrix. Dexamethasone treatment results in a tenfold increase in the rate of fibronectin biosynthesis in HT1080 cells and a twofold increase in untransformed, normal human fibroblasts. Maximal induction levels are attained within one cell generation, while decay of the response requires several cell cycles. Pulse-chase studies showed that most of the newly synthesized fibronectin is secreted into the medium. The glucocorticoid antagonist, RU-486, blocks the dexamethasone-induced changes but does not alter the basal rate of fibronectin production. Therefore, fibronectin biosynthesis appears to be controlled by two distinct mechanisms--one, regulating basal rates of fibronectin production, which is transformation-sensitive and glucocorticoid-independent; and another, which is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in elevated rates of fibronectin biosynthesis upon dexamethasone treatment both in normal fibroblasts and in HT1080 cells.","Oliver, N;Newby, R F;Furcht, L T;Bourgeois, S"
6380747,1983,Cell,The transforming protein of Moloney murine sarcoma virus is a soluble cytoplasmic protein.,"The transforming gene, v-mos, of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MuSV) encodes a 37,000-dalton phosphoprotein, p37mos. Since the biochemical function of this protein is unknown, we have determined the subcellular location of p37mos in M-MuSV 124-transformed cells. Using two different methods of cell lysis and fractionation, we found that newly synthesized as well as mature p37mos is a soluble cytoplasmic protein. In agreement with these results, immunofluorescent staining of cells acutely infected with M-MuSV 124, using an antiserum directed against a synthetic v-mos peptide, produced a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. Gel filtration experiments and glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis suggest that the bulk of p37mos exists as a monomer and is not involved in a specific association with other cellular proteins. These properties of p37mos are different from those of other characterized retroviral transforming proteins.","Papkoff, J;Nigg, E A;Hunter, T"
6831562,1983,Cell,Penetration of Semliki Forest virus from acidic prelysosomal vacuoles.,"To identify and characterize the intracellular site from which the penetration of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to the cytosolic compartment of the host cell occurs, we determined the time course and temperature dependence of nucleocapsid uncoating and infection in BHK-21 cells. At 37 degrees C the genome release to the cytosol was detected within 5-7 min after virus endocytosis, whereas delivery of the virus particles to secondary lysosomes occurred within 15-20 min. At temperatures of 15 degrees -20 degrees C virus particles were internalized by endocytosis, but they were not delivered to the secondary lysosomes. Nevertheless, at 20 degrees C nucleocapsid uncoating and infection occurred, indicating that secondary lysosomes are not required for SFV penetration. We conclude that the penetration reaction occurs in prelysosomal endocytic vacuoles (endosomes). As SFV penetration by membrane fusion requires a pH less than 6 and the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane, the data indicate that endosomes are acidic and contain cholesterol.","Marsh, M;Bolzau, E;Helenius, A"
6403250,1983,Cell,Phosphorylation of tyrosine-416 is not required for the transforming properties and kinase activity of pp60v-src.,"A mutant in src, the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus, has been constructed in which the major phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr-416, located in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein) has been replaced by phenylalanine. Mouse cells transformed with this mutant src form foci and grow in soft agar, indicative of a transformed state. Also, the mutant protein retains the wild-type ability to phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine. Partial proteolysis revealed that the carboxy-terminal half of the mutant protein was still phosphorylated, although apparently to a lesser extent. Analysis indicated that this residual phosphorylation was on tyrosine. We conclude that the major tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60v-src is not required for two of the protein's notable properties--protein kinase activity and transformation of cultured cells.","Snyder, M A;Bishop, J M;Colby, W W;Levinson, A D"
6299585,1983,Cell,Anchorage-independent colony formation of SV40 transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells in serum-free medium: role of cell- and serum-derived factors.,"The colony-forming response of SV40 transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells in agarose suspension culture was studied in a serum-free medium (with insulin, transferrin and serum albumin as the only macromolecular supplements) that was optimized for colony formation of fibronectin-attached monolayer cultures. In this serum-free medium, the SV3T3 cells fail to form colonies in agarose suspension. However, they can be induced to anchorage-independent colony formation by the growth factors that are additionally required by their untransformed counterparts for proliferation in monolayer culture. The SV3T3 cells are also rendered anchorage-independent for colony formation in serum-free medium by conditioned medium from dense monolayer serum-free SV3T3 cultures. These experiments suggest that it is the cell-substrate interaction that is responsible for the growth factor autonomy of fibronectin-attached transformed cells.","McClure, D B"
6299581,1983,Cell,Differentiation of cloned populations of immature B cells after transformation with Abelson murine leukemia virus.,"The nature of the target cell for Abelson virus transformation and the effect of transformation on B cell differentiation were studied with six cloned lines of nontransformed immature B lymphocytes. Three clones were at the pre-B cell stage of maturation prior to A-MuLV infection; two were at the B cell stage, and one appeared to represent a stage prior to rearrangement of the mu heavy chain gene. All six cloned lines could be transformed by Abelson virus. Many of the transformants of the pre-B cell clones underwent kappa light chain gene rearrangement and expression following viral infection. Distinct light chain gene rearrangements were segregated by further subcloning these transformed lines. Abelson virus infection of one cloned cell line believed to represent a stage of maturation prior to the pre-B cell stage produced pre-B cell transformants with a variety of heavy chain gene rearrangements. Thus B lymphoid target cells for Abelson virus are not restricted to a single developmental stage, and some transformed subclones can undergo extensive immunoglobulin gene rearrangements shortly after viral infection.","Whitlock, C A;Ziegler, S F;Treiman, L J;Stafford, J I;Witte, O N"
6299580,1983,Cell,Structure and sequence of the cellular gene homologous to the RSV src gene and the mechanism for generating the transforming virus.,"We determined the nucleotide sequences of all coding regions and a significant part of the flanking regions of the chicken c-src gene, which is a cellular homolog of the v-src gene of Rous sarcoma virus. The c-src gene consists of 12 exons; the boundaries of the exons were determined by assuming that the amino acid sequence of its product, pp60c-src, is basically the same as that of pp60v-src. The deduced amino acid sequence of pp60c-src was very similar to that of pp60v-src, but the last 19 carboxy-terminal amino acids of pp60c-src were replaced by a new set of 12 amino acids of pp60v-src. The sequence encoding the carboxy-terminal sequence of pp60v-src was found 900 bp downstream from the termination codon of the c-src gene. We suggest that the c-src sequence was captured by a virus through recombination at both sides of the c-src gene, and that the recombinations occurred at the level of proviral DNA.","Takeya, T;Hanafusa, H"
6299579,1983,Cell,Frameshift and intragenic suppressor mutations in a Rous sarcoma provirus suggest src encodes two proteins.,"We have analyzed two mutations in src responsible for phenotypic reversion and subsequent retransformation of a Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat cell. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of cloned proviral DNAs reveals a single base pair insertion approximately 438 bp from the 5' end of src in the revertant line 000. This frameshift mutation accounts for an 18 kd protein as the prematurely terminated product of src. The mutation is suppressed in the retransformed line (000*) by a 242 bp duplication that corrects the reading frame to permit synthesis of a 68 kd src protein. A 43 kd src protein with a normal carboxyl terminus is also present in 000 and 000* cells. To make this protein, translation must begin at an internal AUG, found just upstream from the frameshift mutation; in both lines, two src proteins appear to be initiated independently from the same mRNA species. Our results imply that a protein of 7 kd is synthesized from a second reading frame within wild-type src.","Mardon, G;Varmus, H E"
6297803,1983,Cell,BALB and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses alter growth and differentiation of EGF-dependent balb/c mouse epidermal keratinocyte lines.,"Clonal BALB/c mouse epidermal keratinocyte (BALB/MK) cell lines were established in tissue culture. Despite their aneuploid nature, the lines were nontumorigenic, and retained in vitro properties similar to those of primary diploid keratinocytes. These included the constitutive expression of keratin and terminal differentiation in response to a calcium concentration greater than 1.0 mM in the medium. The cells also demonstrated an absolute requirement for nanomolar concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) for their proliferation. BALB or Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses are acute transforming retroviruses, which have been shown to transform fibroblastic and hematopoietic cells. Infection of BALB/MK or its clonal sublines with either virus leads to the rapid acquisition of EGF-independent growth. The cells concomitantly lose their sensitivity to calcium-induced terminal differentiation. Thus these retroviruses can rapidly confer upon epithelial keratinocytes in culture growth properties that resemble those of malignant epidermoid carcinoma cells.","Weissman, B E;Aaronson, S A"
6825168,1983,Cell,Altered gene products are associated with activation of cellular rasK genes in human lung and colon carcinomas.,"Two lung and two colon carcinoma cell lines of human origin, which contained the same activated rasK transforming gene, expressed abnormal species of p21 that were distinct from the p21 proteins expressed in normal human cells and other human carcinomas. The abnormal species of p21 expressed by three of these cell lines were indistinguishable from each other, but differed from the abnormal p21 expressed by one lung carcinoma cell line. NIH cells transformed by DNAs of these carcinomas expressed the same abnormal p21 species, indicating that these abnormal proteins were encoded by the activated rasK genes detected by transfection. These results indicate that transforming activity of rasK genes in human lung and colon carcinoma cell lines is activated by mutations which alter the structure of their gene products, and that activation of rasK genes can result from different molecular alterations in different individual neoplasms.","Der, C J;Cooper, G M"
6681736,1983,Cell,Characterization of target cells for MCF viruses in AKR mice.,"The recombinant (MCF) class of murine leukemia virus appears to play an important role in lymphomagenesis in AKR and other mice. Although much effort has been extended in characterizing MCF viruses, relatively little is known about the cells they infect. I examined what cells were targets in AKR mice for both lymphomagenic and nonlymphomagenic MCF viruses. Lymphomagenic MCF viruses of thymic origin (AKR-247 and C58L1) were found to infect and replicate selectively in immature lymphocytes only present in thymic cortex, whereas nonlymphomagenic MCF viruses of splenic origin (C58v-1-C77 and C58v-2-C45) selectively infected and replicated in cells that appeared to B lymphocytes. Virus-binding studies suggested that neither T- nor B-lymphocyte tropisms were determined by selective attachment of virus to the respective cells. These findings demonstrate that in contrast with ecotropic viruses, which can infect many types of cells in the mouse, specific cellular tropisms can exist for MCF viruses, and that MCF infection, and therefore oncogenicity, is closely linked to cellular differentiation.","Cloyd, M W"
6297784,1983,Cell,Transforming capacities of avian erythroblastosis virus mutants deleted in the erbA or erbB oncogenes.,"Mutants of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) were constructed by deleting large nucleotide segments in each of the viral oncogenes termed v-erbA and v-erbB. Mutants in erbA (erbA -B +) retained the ability to transform fibroblasts in vitro, and these cells exhibited most of the transformation characteristics that typify wild-type AEV-transformed fibroblasts. In addition, the mutants induced small erythroid colonies upon infection of bone marrow cells in culture. Chickens inoculated with erbA -B + virus or with erbA -B +-transformed cells developed sarcomas or atypical erythroid leukemias. The erythroid cells transformed in vivo or in vitro by the erbA -B + viruses appeared not to be as tightly blocked in differentiation as wild-type transformed cells. In contrast, fibroblasts infected with the erbA +B - mutant resembled normal cells in all transformation parameters tested, and no bone marrow cell transformation was observed with the mutant. The results indicate that the main transforming properties of AEV are encoded in erbB and that its effects are enhanced by erbA.","Frykberg, L;Palmieri, S;Beug, H;Graf, T;Hayman, M J;Vennström, B"
6819085,1982,Cell,Novel myc oncogene RNA from abortive immunoglobulin-gene recombination in mouse plasmacytomas.,"We have found that the myc oncogene has been modified by abortive recombination with the alpha heavy-chain immunoglobulin constant-region (C alpha) gene in five different mouse plasmacytoma lines. Recombination occurred approximately 0.8-2.0 kb to the 5' side of two distinct coding regions, defined by sequence homology between the chicken cellular and plasmacytoma myc genes. The myc and C alpha genes were always in opposite transcriptional orientation, with the recombination site within the C alpha switch region sequences. DNA recombination was found to correlate with the production of a novel 2.1 kb species of myc RNA that was 0.4 kb shorter than the normal cellular transcript. No elevated levels of myc RNA were evident, suggesting that DNA rearrangements have altered the myc oncogene product. This oncogene activation corresponds to the chromosomal translocations found in nearly all plasmacytomas.","Shen-Ong, G L;Keath, E J;Piccoli, S P;Cole, M D"
6760989,1982,Cell,Host control of susceptibility to erythroleukemia and to the types of leukemia induced by Friend murine leukemia virus: initial and late stages.,"The genetic control of the susceptibility to early erythroleukemic induction by helper-independent Friend murine leukemia virus was determined to be due to the presence of a single dominant resistant locus. This locus, (termed Fv6), however, governs only resistance to early erythroleukemia, since other types of leukemias developed late in the resistant mice: myelomonocytic leukemia (approximately 70%), T-lymphoid leukemia (approximately 25%) and late erythroleukemia (approximately 10%). Data also indicated that mice with higher DBA/2 (resistant strain) genetic background had an increased frequency of myelomonocytic leukemias. Studies of the hemopoietic modulations indicated that mice that developed early or late erythroleukemia had dramatic increases in erythroid bursts, suggesting that the leukemic blocks are at the level of BFU-E or earlier. High levels of the granulocytic progenitor colonies were also found in mice with late erythroleukemia and myelomonocytic leukemia. Analysis of these leukemias indicate that they are multistage diseases.","Shibuya, T;Mak, T W"
6297778,1982,Cell,"Transformation of both erythroid and myeloid cells by E26, an avian leukemia virus that contains the myb gene.","E26 and avian myeloblastosis virus are replication-defective avian retroviruses that contain the myb oncogene and cause leukemia in chickens with short periods of latency. Animals infected with E26 develop erythroleukemia and also contain low numbers of transformed myeloid cells, while avian myeloblastosis virus induces a purely myeloid leukemia. In both cases the type of leukemia induced is independent of the subgroup of the helper virus used. E26-transformed erythroid and myeloid cells can each be propagated selectively from explanted leukemic cells with media supplemented with factors that promote the growth either of normal chicken erythroid precursors or of myeloid progenitor cells. E26 also induces the outgrowth of transformed cells from bone marrow cells infected in vitro. These cells are also either erythroid or myeloid, depending on the culture conditions employed. Most of the erythroid cells transformed by E26 are erythroblast-like, but a significant number are more mature, including erythrocyte-like cells as well as some cells that appear to be aberrant in differentiation. Both erythroid and myeloid E26-transformed cells produce infectious virus and express P135 E26, the putative (gag-myb-x) transforming protein of the virus. Thus E26 is a virus that is capable of generating factor-dependent transformed cells in two different hematopoietic lineages.","Radke, K;Beug, H;Kornfeld, S;Graf, T"
6297776,1982,Cell,Purification of an adenovirus-coded DNA polymerase that is required for initiation of DNA replication.,"Temperature-sensitive mutants in the N complementation group of human adenovirus type 5 are defective at the nonpermissive temperature for replication of virus DNA and for transformation of rat embryo cells. We show that nuclear extracts prepared from Ad5ts 149-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature fail to replicate DNA in vitro. The defect lies in the first step in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis, the formation of a covalent linkage between the terminal protein precursor (pTP) and dCMP. A 140 kilodalton (140 kd) protein which complements these defective extracts and contains DNA polymerase activity has been purified from HeLa cells infected with wild-type Ad2. It is tightly associated with the 80 kd pTP in a replication complex. Both of these proteins are products of the E2B region of the adenovirus genome, and the 140 kd protein coding sequences lie immediately downstream from those encoding the 80 kd protein. These results demonstrate that adenovirus encodes a novel DNA polymerase that is required for priming of DNA synthesis at the origin of replication. This protein may also function in the initiation of transformation of cultured cells.","Stillman, B W;Tamanoi, F;Mathews, M B"
6297771,1982,Cell,Disproportionate expression of the two nonallelic rat insulin genes in a pancreatic tumor is due to translational control.,"The expression of the two nonallelic but highly homologous rat insulin genes (1 and 2) in a transplantable beta-cell tumor is found to be 10-fold higher for rat1 insulin than rat2 insulin, while in normal pancreatic tissue there are approximately equal amounts of each protein. No large sequence rearrangements of the genes were apparent by restriction analysis of the tumor DNA, and both genes were found to be specifically hypomethylated in the tumor as compared with other nonpancreatic tissue. Equivalent amounts of both insulin 1 and 2 precursor transcripts, as well as stable, mature mRNAs were detected in the tumor. However, two-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitated rat1 and rat2 preproinsulins synthesized in vitro revealed a 10:1 ratio of rat1 to rat2 proteins. A 1:1 ratio was obtained when the tumor mRNA was treated in vitro with vaccinia virus capping extract, suggesting a structural modification at the 5' terminus of the rat2 mRNA. These results are discussed in the context of insulin regulation by glucose, shown to be due to translational control.","Cordell, B;Diamond, D;Smith, S;Pünter, J;Schöne, H H;Goodman, H M"
6297767,1982,Cell,"The transforming proteins of Rous sarcoma virus, Harvey sarcoma virus and Abelson virus contain tightly bound lipid.","We have found that the transforming proteins of Rous sarcoma virus, Harvey sarcoma virus and Abelson virus all contain tightly bound lipid. This modification could play a role in the binding of these proteins to cellular membranes. The lipid associated with p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, is located in the NH2-terminal domain of the polypeptide. This is the region of the protein that has been shown previously to participate in binding the protein to membranes. Two mature forms of p21, the transforming protein of Harvey sarcoma virus, contain lipid. Lipid is not, however, associated with newly synthesized p21. While mature p60src and p21 are bound to cellular membranes, the newly synthesized forms of these proteins are not. The posttranslational addition of lipid may therefore be the means by which these proteins acquire an affinity for membranes.","Sefton, B M;Trowbridge, I S;Cooper, J A;Scolnick, E M"
6186388,1982,Cell,The mesothelial keratins: a new family of cytoskeletal proteins identified in cultured mesothelial cells and nonkeratinizing epithelia.,"The cytoskeletal proteins of cultured normal human mesothelial cells were found to consist of six major components, including actin, vimentin, the 40 kd keratin and the 44, 52 and 55 kd proteins, plus a minor 46 kd protein. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping and immunoprecipitation tests showed that the 40-55 kd mesothelial proteins are a family of keratins distinct in size, charge or peptide map from the ""epidermal keratins"" synthesized by cultured keratinocytes. Unique combinations of keratins from the epidermal and mesothelial keratin families were found to be synthesized by cultured bladder, esophageal, conjunctival, mammary, exocervical and ovarian surface epithelial cells. Mesothelial cells were the only epithelial cell type that synthesized vimentin at more than trace levels. We have also found that many carcinoma cell lines express keratins different from those of their cell type of origin.","Wu, Y J;Parker, L M;Binder, N E;Beckett, M A;Sinard, J H;Griffiths, C T;Rheinwald, J G"
6130850,1982,Cell,Extended self-renewal capacity of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells: association with persistent Friend spleen focus-forming virus.,"The pluripotential hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) of genetically resistant Fv2rr adult C57BL/6 (B6) mice can be persistently infected by Friend virus (FV) when exposed to defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) and helper virus (LLV) at the time of transplantation into heavily irradiated syngeneic recipients (that is, B6 leads to B6 isologous chimeras). Whereas normal and LLV+ marrow were depleted of CFU-S after three serial transplantations at 14-day intervals, SFFV+ donor marrow exhibited prolonged self-renewal capacity. SFFV+ CFU-S from B6. Fv2rr chimeric mice gave rise to normal erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells and were easily detected and quantified over 17 serial marrow transfers equivalent to 260 cumulative days. Marrow cellularity on day 14 of each transfer remained constant during the entire transplantation time. When SFFV fell below detectable levels at passage 15, CFU-S self-renewal exhibited rapid and total decline. Since the frequency of LLV-infected cells in late marrow transfers rose during the period of CFU-S decline, we conclude that SFFV is directly associated with the triggering of CFU-S self-renewal. It is also suggested that this proliferative event may be a prerequisite for the development of FV-induced leukemia.","Eckner, R J;Hettrick, K L;Greenberger, J S;Bennett, M"
6297744,1982,Cell,Substitution of 5' helper virus sequences into non-rel portion of reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T suppresses transformation of chicken spleen cells.,"The genome of the highly oncogenic avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T (REV-T) differs from that of the helper virus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A by a substitution (rel and a large deletion. Further deletions, constructed in vitro, within the helper-virus-related sequences of REV-T have little effect on the ability of the virus to transform chicken spleen cells in vitro. However, deletions that extend into rel abolish transformation. Substitution of helper-virus-related sequences for the deleted region in the non-rel portion of REV-T also abolishes transformation. Viruses with revertant phenotype were obtained both spontaneously and by construction in vitro from these substituted recombinants. The revertant viruses have various mutations, including deletions and insertions, in the helper-virus-related sequences. Thus the additional helper-virus-related sequences suppress expression of transformation in cis, and the deletion in REV-T seems necessary for expression of the transforming properties of the virus.","Chen, I S;Temin, H M"
6291785,1982,Cell,Continuing kappa-gene rearrangement in a cell line transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus.,"A cell line transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus, called PD, is capable of carrying out kappa-gene rearrangement while growing in culture. Subclones of PD have diverse kappa-gene structures, and some derivatives show evidence of continued joining activity after as many as three subclonings. Analysis of PD sublineages has shown that a rearranged chromosome can undergo secondary kappa-gene rearrangements, producing either a new rearrangement or a deletion of C kappa. Although the PD line actively rearranges its kappa genes, its rearranged heavy-chain genes show little variation, and there is no rearrangement of lambda genes. In PD subclones, DNA fragments representing the reciprocal product of kappa-gene rearrangement are often evident, and they may undergo either further rearrangement or deletion. The implications of multiple rearrangements on a single chromosome and of the maintenance of reciprocal fragments are considered in the context of a model that postulates that the V kappa and J kappa segments are not all organized in the DNA in the same transcriptional direction, leading to inversions rather than deletions during joining.","Lewis, S;Rosenberg, N;Alt, F;Baltimore, D"
6291784,1982,Cell,Nucleotide sequence of Fujinami sarcoma virus: evolutionary relationship of its transforming gene with transforming genes of other sarcoma viruses.,"We determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the molecularly cloned DNA of Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV). The sequence of 1182 amino acids was deduced for the FSV transforming protein P130, the product of the FSV gag-fps fused gene. The P130 sequence was highly homologous to the amino acid sequence obtained for the gag-fes protein of feline sarcoma virus, supporting the view that fps and fes were derived from a cognate cellular gene in avian and mammalian species. In addition, FSV P130 and p60src of Rous sarcoma virus were 40% homologous in the region of the carboxyterminal 280 amino acids, which includes the phosphoacceptor tyrosine residue. These results strongly suggest that the 3' region of fps/fes and src originated from a common progenitor sequence. A portion (the U3 region) of the long terminal repeat of FSV DNA appears to be unusual among avian retroviruses in its close similarity in sequence and overall organization to the same region of the endogenous viral ev1 DNA.","Shibuya, M;Hanafusa, H"
6183005,1982,Cell,Nucleotide sequences of feline retroviral oncogenes (v-fes) provide evidence for a family of tyrosine-specific protein kinase genes.,"The nucleotide sequences encoding the transforming polyproteins of the Snyder-Theilen and Gardner-Arnstein strains of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV) have been determined. These sequences include a viral transforming gene (v-fes), derived from cellular proto-oncogene sequences (c-fes) of domestic cats by recombination with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The v-fes sequences are predicted to encode a polypeptide domain strikingly similar to that specified by the transforming gene (v-fps) of the avian Fujinami sarcoma virus. In addition, the 3' 0.8 kilobase pairs of v-fes encode amino acid sequences homologous to the carboxy-terminal portion of pp60src, the transforming protein encoded by the avian Rous sarcoma virus src gene. Thus different feline and avian retroviral transforming genes, all of which encode functionally related proteins with associated tyrosine-specific kinase activities, must be derived from divergent members of the same proto-oncogene family.","Hampe, A;Laprevotte, I;Galibert, F;Fedele, L A;Sherr, C J"
6183004,1982,Cell,Monoclonal antibody to murine embryos defines a stage-specific embryonic antigen expressed on mouse embryos and human teratocarcinoma cells.,"A murine stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA3) is defined by reactivity with a monoclonal antibody prepared by immunization of a rat with 4- to 8-cell-stage mouse embryos. This antigenic determinant, present on oocytes, becomes restricted first to the inner cell mass at the blastocyst stage, and later to the primitive endoderm. Murine teratocarcinoma stem cells do not react with this antibody, whereas human teratocarcinoma stem cells are SSEA3-positive. This antigenic determinant is not expressed on a variety of other human and murine cell lines, but is found on the surface of human erythrocytes. It is a carbohydrate and is present on both cell-surface glycolipids and glycopeptides. These results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying stage-specific antigenic determinants with monoclonal antibody prepared against embryos. The need for thorough screening on a variety of cell types to establish developmentally important cross-reactivities is also emphasized.","Shevinsky, L H;Knowles, B B;Damjanov, I;Solter, D"
6291772,1982,Cell,Persistence of freely replicating SV40 recombinant molecules carrying a selectable marker in permissive simian cells.,"We have demonstrated that a SV40-pBR322 recombinant vector (pSV2-gpt) carrying a bacterial gene of selectable phenotype (Eco-gpt) may persist extrachromosomally in COS1 cells, a simian cell line that endogenously produces SV40 large T antigen. The amount of circular (supercoiled) recombinant DNA was estimated to be between 5 and 2000 copies per cell among several pSV2-transformed COS1 clonal lines examined. Complete pSV2 molecules were found in the majority of the transformants, although some of the pSV2 DNAs recovered were shown to have deletions in the pBR322 region. Our results indicate that removal of the pBR322 ""inhibitory sequence"" in pSV2 is not necessary for stable maintenance of these recombinant molecules in COS1 cells. In addition, large amounts of pSV2-related high molecular weight DNAs, probably concatemers of pSV2, were detected in the transformed lines.","Tsui, L C;Breitman, M L;Siminovitch, L;Buchwald, M"
6291771,1982,Cell,SV40 large tumor antigen can regulate some cellular transcripts in a positive fashion.,"Eleven cDNA clones identified from a cDNA library prepared from the mRNA fraction of SV40 transformed cells detected, by hybridization, higher levels of cellular mRNA in SV40-transformed cells than in nontransformed cells. Three of these cDNA clones detected levels of cellular mRNA that were more than 100-fold greater in SV40tsA transformed cell lines grown at the permissive temperature than in those grown at the nonpermissive temperature. Northern blot hybridizations confirmed these results and in some cases detected RNA species of multiple sizes that were regulated in a temperature-dependent fashion in SV40tsA transformed cell lines. Infection of 3T3 cells with SV40 stimulated the levels of RNAs complementary to these cDNA clones. The results demonstrate that the SV40 large T antigen can regulate the steady state levels of some cellular RNA species.","Schutzbank, T;Robinson, R;Oren, M;Levine, A J"
6291770,1982,Cell,Role of small t antigen in the acute transforming activity of SV40.,"A plasmid, pHR402, containing SV40 sequences that include a truncated early region bearing an intact t-coding sequence and a functionally intact late region, was introduced into thymidine kinase deficient (tk-) mouse L cells by cotransformation with a cloned tk gene. tk+ cotransformants synthesized SV40 t but not T antigen, and no truncated T-coding sequence products were detected. The viral sequences of pHR402 were reconstituted as a virus in COS1 cells, and acute infection of untransformed mouse cells with this viral stock (SV402) also led to the appearance of t but not T or a truncated T. Abortive transformation assays of such infected cells were negative, as were those performed on the same cells infected with either of two viral mutants (dl883 and dl884), each of which leads to T but not t synthesis. However, mixed infection with SV402 and either dl883 or dl884 led to a clear abortive and permanent transformation response. Thus, at least in part, t and T appear to function in a complementary fashion in eliciting transformation expression by SV40-infected cells.","Rubin, H;Figge, J;Bladon, M T;Chen, L B;Ellman, M;Bikel, I;Farrell, M;Livingston, D M"

The antigen is termed B-LAST 1 and is found on B cells transformed in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and pokeweed mitogen; in vivo with EBV and antigen; and on neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and poorly differentiated lymphoma. The antigen has a molecular weight of 45,000 and was not found on cells of T, null or myeloid lineage, whether obtained from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, neoplasms or cell lines. The antigen is expressed at a much higher level on EBV-infected cells than on any other cell type studied, but does not appear to be virally encoded. The significance of this antigen in the process of viral and nonviral transformation and its possible role as a target for T-cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells is discussed.","Thorley-Lawson, D A;Schooley, R T;Bhan, A K;Nadler, L M"
6291767,1982,Cell,Regulation of the synthesis of extracellular matrix components in chondroblasts transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus.,"Regulation of cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis has been examined in chondroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus. Cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature synthesized large amounts of several chondroblast-specific polypeptides (type IV proteoglycan core protein, type II procollagen, a proteoglycan link protein(s) and a 60 kd protein) and very low levels of fibronectin. At the permissive temperature, synthesis of chondroblast-specific proteins was coordinately reduced, while fibronectin synthesis was greatly increased. These changes reflected comparable alterations in levels of translatable mRNAs encoding these proteins. This analysis also revealed the unexpected presence in the transformed cells of type I collagen mRNAs, which are not used in intact cells, indicating that a posttranscriptional control (or controls) may be acting in transformed chondroblasts.","Adams, S L;Boettiger, D;Focht, R J;Holtzer, H;Pacifici, M"
6183001,1982,Cell,Expression of the ASV src gene in hybrids between normal and virally transformed cells: specific suppression occurs in some hybrids but not others.,"Somatic cell hybrids have been made between clones of rat cells transformed by avian sarcoma virus and rat or mouse cells that are untransformed. Intraspecies hybrids were either predominantly morphologically normal or predominantly transformed, some clones that formed transformed intraspecies hybrids yielding normal interspecies hybrids. Untransformed hybrids usually showed no detectable alteration in the structure or location of the integrated provirus, but viral RNA and pp60src kinase activities were much reduced. No decrease in viral gene expression was seen in transformed hybrids. Thus hybrid suppression of viral transformation, mediated in trans by the untransformed parent, is a specific event that depends on both untransformed and transformed parental parameters.","Dyson, P J;Quade, K;Wyke, J A"
6185233,1982,Cell,In vivo tyrosine phosphorylations of the Abelson virus transforming protein are absent in its normal cellular homolog.,"The transforming gene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) is a phosphoprotein encoded by combined viral and cellular sequences. Previous work has shown the existence of a serologically crossreactive normal cellular phosphoprotein called NCP150. We have utilized two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis to compare the structures of NCP150 and wild-type and mutant forms of the A-MuLV protein labeled in vivo with 32P-orthophosphate. This analysis demonstrated clear homology between NCP150 and wild-type A-MuLV protein, but a number of phosphorylation differences were seen. Among them, two specific tyrosine phosphorylations present in all transformation-competent Abelson proteins were not observed in NCP150. No other phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were detected. In addition, transformation-defective mutants isolated from either the P120 or P160 wild-type strain lack phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Double-infection studies with such transformation-defective and transformation-competent A-MuLV strains show that Abelson viral proteins may be substrates for their own tyrosine-specific kinase activity in vivo. These observations suggest that the phosphotyrosine kinase activity of the abl region may be controlled, and may function, differently in its viral and cellular forms.","Ponticelli, A S;Whitlock, C A;Rosenberg, N;Witte, O N"
7116446,1982,Cell,Differences in patterns of complementation of the more common groups of xeroderma pigmentosum: possible implications.,"Xeroderma pigmentosum of groups A, C and D shows complementation differing in kinetics, dependence on the dose of wild-type alleles and dependence on protein synthesis. Such differences suggest that XP-A, -C and -D carry mutations at different loci. The product of the first of these loci (factor A) is present in significant excess in normal fibroblasts, seems to turn over rapidly and may be a dimer or higher polymer. The products of the other two loci (factors C and D) do not seem to be present in significant excess in the cytoplasm of normal fibroblasts, but factor C may accumulate abnormally in XP-D. Factors C and D turn over slowly (D more than C) and they do not move freely from the cell nucleus. Factors A and C, at least, seem to act directly and not via gene regulation.","Giannelli, F;Pawsey, S A;Avery, J A"
6288258,1982,Cell,Detection of a transforming gene product in cells transformed by Moloney murine sarcoma virus.,"We identified, in cells transformed by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MuSV clone 124), a protein encoded by the M-MuSV transforming gene, v-mos. An antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of a protein predicted from the v-mos nucleotide sequence specifically recognizes a protein doublet of approximately 37,000 daltons from 35S-methionine-labeled M-MuSV 124-transformed producer cells. By peptide mapping, this protein is almost identical to the 37 kd in vitro translation product from the M-MuSV v-mos gene. Immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled cells contain a single v-mos-specific phosphoprotein, which has at least six sites of phosphorylation containing phosphoserine. Pulse-chase experiments show that the lower band in the 35S-methionine-labeled doublet is the primary translation product, which is modified, probably by phosphorylation, to yield the upper band. A similar mos protein is immunoprecipitated from HT1-MuSV-transformed cells, but not from uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. These mos proteins are present at very low levels in transformed cell lines. Cells acutely infected with M-MuSV 124, however, transiently contain much higher levels of the mos protein. These high levels coincide with extensive cell mortality.","Papkoff, J;Verma, I M;Hunter, T"

As a first step in determining whether and how the integrated sequences contribute to formation of the tumors in which they are found, we have cloned two such integrations of WHV and have determined their structure by restriction mapping and heteroduplex electron microscopy. The identity of the cloned sequences was confirmed by comparison of restriction sites in the clones with those located by Southern blot analysis of tumor DNA. Viral sequences in both integrations are extensively rearranged, and in neither were all parts of the viral genome represented. In this respect, the behavior of WHV in vivo is similar to that of other DNA tumor viruses that have been studied in vitro. We discuss the implications of these results in relation to possible mechanisms for tumor induction by WHV.","Ogston, C W;Jonak, G J;Rogler, C E;Astrin, S M;Summers, J"
6286138,1982,Cell,Isolation of a transforming sequence from a human bladder carcinoma cell line.,"We have isolated the component of human bladder carcinoma cell DNA that is able to transform mouse fibroblasts. The oncogenic sequence was isolated initially from a lambda phage genomic library made from DNA of a transfected mouse cell carrying the human oncogene. A subcloned insert of 6.6 kb that carried transforming activity was amplified in the plasmid vector pBR322. The subcloned oncogene has been used as a sequence probe in Southern blot analyses. The oncogene appears to derive from sequences present in normal cellular DNA. Structural analysis has failed so far to reveal differences between the oncogene and its normal cellular homolog. The oncogene is unrelated to transforming sequences detected in a variety of other types of human tumor cell lines derived from colonic and lung carcinoma and from neuroblastoma. In contrast, the EJ bladder oncogene appears closely related to one that is active in the human T24 bladder carcinoma cell line. The oncogene appears to have undergone little, if any, amplification in several bladder carcinoma cell lines.","Shih, C;Weinberg, R A"
7094018,1982,Cell,Target cells infected by avian erythroblastosis virus differentiate and become transformed.,"Transformation in vitro of bone marrow cells by avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) gives rise to rapidly growing cells of erythroid nature. Target cells of neoplastic transformation by AEV are recruited among the early progenitors of the erythroid lineage, the burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E). They express a brain-related antigen at a high level and an immature antigen at a low level. We show that AEV-transformed cells express low levels of the brain antigen and high levels of the immature antigen. Their response to specific factors regulating the erythroid differentiation indicates that they are very sensitive to erythropoietin. Furthermore, cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of AEV differentiate into hemoglobin-synthesizing cells 4 days after being shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. All these properties are similar to those of late progenitors of the erythroid lineage, the colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E). These results indicate that the AEV-transformed cells are blocked in their differentiation at the CFU-E stage.","Samarut, J;Gazzolo, L"
7094017,1982,Cell,A cellular protein is immunologically crossreactive with and functionally homologous to the Fujinami sarcoma virus transforming protein.,"We obtained a regressing-tumor antiserum specific for the unique sequence of the transforming protein P140 of Fujinami sarcoma virus by injecting Fischer rats with syngeneic embryo cells transformed with Fujinami sarcoma virus. This serum is capable of immunoprecipitating a protein of 98,000 daltons from cell extracts of normal, uninfected chicken bone marrow cells. This normal cellular protein (NCP98) was shown to be structurally related to P140, sharing the majority of 35S-methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with the viral gene product P140. NCP98 is a phosphoprotein in vivo, with an associated in vitro protein kinase activity, capable of phosphorylating specifically at tyrosine residues of NCP98 itself and alpha-casein, an externally added substrate. This kinase activity is biochemically indistinguishable from the kinase activity associated with P140 by all criteria tested. Moreover, in vitro-phosphorylated NCP98 and P140 shared the same phosphopeptides. The expression of NCP98 is tissue-specific. It is readily detectable in bone marrow cells and detectable to a lesser extent in liver and lung cells from 6--18 day old chickens.","Mathey-Prevot, B;Hanafusa, H;Kawai, S"
7094016,1982,Cell,Identification of a phosphoprotein specifically induced by the transforming DNA of rat neuroblastomas.,"DNAs from nitrosoethylurea-induced rat neuroblastomas transform NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts in a transfection assay. DNAs of such transformed cells can be used in a subsequent cycle of transfection to generate secondary foci that contain virtually no foreign genetic material besides the sequences carrying the rat neuroblastoma transforming function. These secondary neuroblastoma transfectants were injected into young mice and grew out into fibrosarcomas. Sera from these mice were examined for reactivity with any proteins which were induced specifically by the neuroblastoma transforming sequence. These sera precipitate a polypeptide of about 185,000 daltons from 35S-methionine-labeled cell lysates of the rat neuroblastoma cells that served as DNA donors and in all transfection-derived primary and secondary foci. This protein is present in high levels in all neuroblastoma transfectant clones, but was not detectable in a variety of other transformed cells. Antisera were prepared from mice bearing tumors induced by transformed cells derived by transfection of DNAs from various tumor cell types unrelated to rat neuroblastoma. These antisera failed to immunoprecipitate the 185,000 dalton protein. These data indicate that the synthesis of the 185,000 dalton protein is specifically induced by the neuroblastoma transforming sequence. The protein may be encoded by the transforming sequence and may mediate transformation in this chemically induced tumor.","Padhy, L C;Shih, C;Cowing, D;Finkelstein, R;Weinberg, R A"

The differentiated cells resemble mature erythrocytes with respect to morphology and ultrastructure, expression of differentiation-specific cell-surface antigens, pattern of protein synthesis and hemoglobin content. Terminal differentiation is dependent on conditions favoring the differentiation of normal erythroid progenitor cells, including an erythropoietin-like factor. Colonies of ts AEV cells grown at 42 degrees C semisolid medium resemble erythrocyte colonies derived from normal erythroid progenitor cells. The colonies obtained were comparable in size or slightly larger than the late erythroid precursor (CFU-E) colonies. These results suggest that AEV-transformed cells are blocked at a stage of differentiation that is more advanced than that of the uninfected target cells. ts AEV cells are irreversibly committed to terminal differentiation within 20 to 30 hr after shift to 42 degrees C.","Beug, H;Palmieri, S;Freudenstein, C;Zentgraf, H;Graf, T"
6807553,1982,Cell,Role of mitochondrial membrane potential in the regulation of murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation.,"The level of cytoplasmic calcium ions appears to be important in the control of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Our interest in this study focuses on the relationship between the regulation of calcium concentration and differentiation. We used the fluorescent membrane probe DiOC6 to examine the relationship between MEL cell mitochondria and changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels occurring at the initiation of commitment. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the selective association of DiOC6 with MEL cell mitochondria, where an enhanced fluorescence is observed. Treatment of cells with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or other inducers causes a decrease in mitochondria-associated fluorescence levels that occurs with the initiation of commitment. A decrease in DiOC6 fluorescence is caused by agents that reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, but is only slightly affected by agents that alter plasma membrane potential. Amiloride and EGTA, agents that prevent commitment and inhibit calcium uptake, also prevent the decrease in DiOC6 uptake caused by DMSO. The effect of DMSO on MEL cell mitochondria is mimicked by FCCP, a proton ionophore that dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential. FCCP also caused MEL cell mitochondria to release calcium into the cytoplasm. When MEL cells are treated with DMSO plus FCCP, commitment is initiated without the lag period observed when cells are treated with DMSO alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial transmembrane potential is important in the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium levels at the time of commitment of MEL cells to terminal differentiation.","Levenson, R;Macara, I G;Smith, R L;Cantley, L;Housman, D"
6284379,1982,Cell,Changes in amino-terminal sequences of pp60src lead to decreased membrane association and decreased in vivo tumorigenicity.,"We have suggested previously that the amino-terminal 8 kilodaltons of pp60src may serve as a structural hydrophobic domain through which pp60src attaches to plasma membranes. Two isolates of recovered avian sarcoma viruses (rASVs), 1702 and 157, encode pp60src proteins that have alterations in this amino-terminal region. The rASV 1702 src protein (56 kilodaltons) and the 157 src protein (62.5 kilodaltons) show altered membrane association, and fractionate largely as soluble, cytoplasmic proteins in aqueous buffers, ion contrast with the membrane association of more than 80% of the src protein of standard avian sarcoma virus under the identical fractionation procedure. Plasma membranes purified from cells transformed by these rASVs contain less than 10% of the amount of pp60src found in membranes purified from cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus or control rASVs. The altered membrane association of these src proteins had little or no effect on the properties of chick embryo fibroblasts transformed in monolayer culture. In contrast, rASV 1702 showed reduced in vivo tumorigenicity compared with Rous sarcoma virus or with other rASVs that encode membrane-associated src proteins. Rous sarcoma virus-induced tumors are malignant, poorly differentiated sarcomas that are lethal to their hosts. rASV 1702 induces a benign, differentiated sarcoma that regresses and is not lethal to its hosts. These data support the role of amino-terminal sequences in the membrane association of pp60src, and suggest that the amino terminus of pp60src may have a critical role in the promotion of in vivo tumorigenicity.","Krueger, J G;Garber, E A;Goldberg, A R;Hanafusa, H"
6284378,1982,Cell,Genetic interactions in induction of endogenous murine leukemia virus from low leukemic mice.,"The frequency of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) production in cells induced with halogenated pyrimidines has been investigated in several low leukemic strains of mice. Very few BALB/c or C57BL/6 (B6) induced embryo cells produce MuLV; this low frequency increases 10 to 50 fold in cells of the BALB/c x B6 F1 hybrid. Data from back-crosses of the F1 hybrid to each parent and from BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains indicate that the phenotype of enhanced MuLV production results from interaction of two unlinked loci, dominant (+/+) alleles of which are carried by either parent. Genetic tests with BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains confirm this two-locus model. The loci are designated Inc-1 and Inb-1 to signify their phenotypic detection by induction and the BALB/c or B6 strain of origin, respectively. Examination of hybrids of BALB/c and of B6 with other strains indicates that strains related in pedigree to BALB/c carry Inc-1, whereas those related to B6 carry Inb-1. Identification of genetic loci that specifically interact to enhance MuLV production after exposure to halogenated pyrimidines indicates the existence of mechanisms that regulate the induction or intracellular expression of endogenous MuLV.","McCubrey, J;Risser, R"
6284377,1982,Cell,Stage-specific transforming genes of human and mouse B- and T-lymphocyte neoplasms.,"DNAs of 20 B- and T-lymphocyte neoplasms of human and mouse origin induced transformation of NIH/3T3 cells with high efficiencies, indicating that these neoplasms contained activated transforming genes that were detectable by transfection. Analysis of the susceptibility of the transforming activities of lymphocyte-neoplasm DNAs to digestion with restriction endonucleases indicated that the same or closely related transforming genes were activated in independent neoplasms representative of the same stage of normal cell differentiation. However, different transforming genes were activated in neoplasms representative of different stages of normal B- and T-lymphocyte differentiation. These results indicate that specific transforming genes are activated in neoplasms of discrete stages of differentiation within these cell lineages.","Lane, M A;Sainten, A;Cooper, G M"
7200400,1982,Cell,Variant T47D human breast cancer cells with high progesterone-receptor levels despite estrogen and antiestrogen resistance.,"In target tissues for estrogen, including breast cancer cells, the synthesis of progesterone receptors (PRs) is controlled by estradiol acting through estrogen receptors (ERs). We describe studies with T47D human breast cancer cells, whose PRs are not regulated by estradiol, though present in extraordinary amounts (300,000 sites per cell). These cells have no ERs sedimenting at 8S on sucrose density gradients, and no unfilled cytoplasmic or nuclear ERs; some apparently hormone-filled nuclear sites, with KD congruent to 0.7 nM, can be demonstrated by exchange. The nuclear ER sites are not processed after estradiol treatment. Nafoxidine, however, doubles nuclear estrogen binding in 6 hr, in a cycloheximide-insensitive step that may represent a reversal of processing. T47D cells are profoundly resistant to estrogens and antiestrogens; estradiol does not stimulate PRs, and nafoxidine concentrations that are cytotoxic to ER-positive cells have no effect on cell growth or on PR levels. Yet the PRs are normal by several criteria, and they can be stoichiometrically translocated to, and extracted from, nuclei in the first 3 min after progesterone addition. If progesterone treatment exceeds 10 min, rapid nuclear turnover prevents quantitative PR recovery. Cytoplasmic PRs are replenished in 10 to 24 hr, and this cycloheximide-sensitive step is also estrogen- and nafoxidine-resistant. However, despite their insensitivity to estradiol or antiestrogen, PRs are not constitutively synthesized; 5-bromodeoxyuridine and sodium butyrate can selectively inhibit PR production. Thus, since PRs retain some characteristics of inducible proteins, the persistent nuclear estrogen-binding sites may be stimulating PRs continuously, even in the absence of exogenous estradiol.","Horwitz, K B;Mockus, M B;Lessey, B A"
7060128,1982,Cell,Teratocarcinoma cell adhesion: identification of a cell-surface protein involved in calcium-dependent cell aggregation.,"Teratocarcinoma cells have a Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion site (t-CDS) that is unique in being inactivated with trypsin in the absence of CA2+ but not in the presence of Ca2+. Fab fragments of antibodies raised against teratocarcinoma F9 cells dissociated by treatment with trypsin and calcium (anti-TC-F9) inhibit the aggregation of teratocarcinoma cells mediated by t-CDS. This inhibitory effect of Fab is removed when anti-TC-F9 is absorbed with F9 cells treated with trypsin and calcium (TC-F9), but not when it is absorbed with F9 cells treated with trypsin and EGTA (TE-F9). Comparisons of cell-surface antigens reactive to anti-TC-F9 in TC-F9 cells with those in TE-F9 cells reveal that only one component, with an approximate molecular weight of 140,000 (p140), is detected specifically on the surface of TC-F9 cells. When TC-F9 cells are retrypsinized in the absence of CA2+, a substance with an approximate molecular weight of 34,000 (p34) is released that can neutralize the aggregation-inhibitory effect of the Fab. This p34 interferes with the immunoprecipitation of p140 with anti-TC-F9, suggesting that p34 is a tryptic fragment of p140. Anti-TC-F9 Fab causes the dissociation of the monolayers of teratocarcinoma cells. This effect is removed by absorption of the Fab with p34 as well as with TC-F9 cells, but not with TE-F9 cells. These results suggest that p140 is essential for the function of t-CDS, and that this is an actual cell-adhesion molecule active in the establishment of monolayers of teratocarcinoma cells.","Yoshida, C;Takeichi, M"
6277513,1982,Cell,Adenovirus E1b-58kd tumor antigen and SV40 large tumor antigen are physically associated with the same 54 kd cellular protein in transformed cells.,"The adenovirus E1b-58kd tumor antigen has been detected in a physical association with a 54 kilodalton cellular protein in adenovirus-transformed mouse cells. Antibody specific for the E1b-58kd protein coimmunoprecipitates a 54 kd protein from transformed, but not from productively infected, cells. Monoclonal antibody specific for the cellular 54 kd protein coimmunoprecipitates the adenovirus E1b-58kd protein from transformed cell extracts. The same or closely related cellular 54 kd protein, associated with the adenovirus E1b-58kd protein, was present in the SV40 large T antigen-54 kd complex previously detected in SV40-transformed mouse cells. The identity of the 54 kd protein is based on the immunological specificities of the anti-54 kd monoclonal antibodies and partial peptide maps of the 54 kd protein associated with the adenovirus and SV40 tumor antigens. The adenovirus E1b-58kd-54 kd complex, like the SV40 large T antigen-54 kd complex, is heterogeneous in size or mass. While all of the cellular 54 kd protein in the adenovirus-transformed cell extract is found in a complex with the E1b-58kd protein, some of the viral 58 kd antigen is detected in a form not associated with the 54 kd protein. The fact that the adenovirus and Sv40 tumor antigens, both required for transformation, can be found in physical association with the same cellular protein in a transformed cell is a good indication that these two diverse viral proteins share some common mechanisms or functions.","Sarnow, P;Ho, Y S;Williams, J;Levine, A J"
6279315,1982,Cell,Decreased uptake and retention of rhodamine 123 by mitochondria in feline sarcoma virus-transformed mink cells.,"A reduce uptake and retention of the mitochondria-specific membrane potential probe rhodamine 123 by feline sarcoma virus (FeSV)-transformed mink fibroblasts (64F3) has been detected. The decreased accumulation of rhodamine 123 by 64F3 mitochondria is not due to abnormal plasma membrane dye permeability, since after microinjection of the dye these cells are still unable to retain the dye at levels comparable to the untransformed parental cells, CCL 64. Nigericin, an ionophore that mediates an electrically neutral exchange of protons for potassium ions resulting the elimination of the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane and a compensatory increase in mitochondrial membrane potential with continued respiration, increases both the dye uptake and the retention time in transformed 64F3 cells. These results suggest that mitochondria in FeSV-transformed mink cells may have an abnormally low mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by a relatively high pH gradient. Since anioic metabolites such as pyruvate and glutamate are accumulated by mitochondria in proportion to the delta pH across the mitochondrial membrane, the abnormal mitochondria described here may contribute to the abnormal metabolic state of FeSV-transformed cells.","Johnson, L V;Summerhayes, I C;Chen, L B"

A direct proportionality between the rate of albumin production and the concentration of albumin mRNA sequences was found for all albumin-producing hepatoma and hybrid clones, indicating that rate of synthesis of the protein is determined by the concentration of its mRNA. Albumin-negative dedifferentiated variant and somatic hybrid cells contain fewer than one to five molecules of albumin mRNA per cell; the block in expression of the gene appears to be at the same (probably transcriptional) level in variants and their somatic hybrids.","Cassio, D;Weiss, M C;Ott, M O;Sala-Trepat, J M;Friès, J;Erdos, T"
6976838,1981,Cell,Cell-cell interactions in early embryogenesis: a molecular approach to the role of calcium.,"Compaction, a process of cell-cell adhesion between mouse blastomeres or between embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells requires calcium ions. A decompaction effect similar to that observed in the absence of Ca2+ is triggered by Fab fragments of rabbit anti-EC IgG. This effect occurs through the recognition of a specific cell-surface glycoprotein named uvomorulin. An 84,000 dalton fragment of uvomorulin (UMt) has been previously extracted by trypsin from EC cell membranes and purified. WE present evidence that effects of Ca2+ on compaction are transmitted through conformational changes in uvomorulin. First, Ca2+ protects UMt from further proteolysis by trypsin. Mn2+ and Sr2+ have similar effects, whereas this protection is reversed by La3+. Second, UMt can bind the monoclonal antibody De1 only in the presence of Ca2+ (half-binding at 10(-5) M Ca2+). This antigenic exposure also takes place in the presence of Mn2+ or Sr2+ and is reversed by La3+. Third, metal ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Sr2+) that promote trypsin resistance and recognition by DE1 are found to trigger the compaction of morulae and EC cells. Metal ions (La3+) that reduce trypsin resistance and affinity for DE1 result in decompaction.","Hyafil, F;Babinet, C;Jacob, F"
6459855,1981,Cell,Cloning of a functional gene responsible for the expression of a cell surface antigen correlated with human chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"A cell--cell hybrid of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and human peripheral blood lymphoblasts from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia produces a surface antigen detectable by a monoclonal antibody. This surface antigen can be detected at significant levels on a fraction of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not on normal human lymphocytes from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Two different clones capable of transforming mouse cells to produce the surface antigen were isolated from a gene library of the hybrid cell by identification of small portions of the library containing functional genes, followed by detection of clones with human-specific reiterated sequences. Both clones also contain CHO-specific reiterated sequences and are therefore human--CHO recombinants. From the frequency of antigen-producing clones in the library, we estimate that they were present in the hybrid cell genome at a copy number of 100 to 1000.","Stanners, C P;Lam, T;Chamberlain, J W;Stewart, S S;Price, G B"
6276018,1981,Cell,Analysis of transforming gene products from Moloney murine sarcoma virus.,"We previously showed that in vitro translation of M-MuSV virion RNA yielded a 62 kd gag gene product and an overlapping set of four proteins with approximate molecular weights of 37,000, 33,000, 24,000 and 18,000. In this paper we show, by use of hybrid arrest translation with cloned recombinant DNAs containing M-MuSV v-mosMo sequences, that the 37, 33, 24 and 18 kd proteins are synthesized in their entirety from the v-mosMo gene. Analysis of the primary sequence of these proteins shows that each one is initiated independently from AUG codons within the v-mosMo gene and utilizes the long open reading frame predicted from the v-mosMo DNA sequence. Antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C terminus of the predicted v-mosMo gene product precipitate all four in vitro v-mosMo proteins.","Papkoff, J;Lai, M H;Hunter, T;Verma, I M"
7332930,1981,Cell,A washable macromolecule from Fv2rr marrow negatively regulates DNA synthesis in erythropoietic progenitor cells BFU-E.,"The proportion of BFU-E normally engaged in DNA synthesis is low in adult B6 (C57BL/6) mice of genotype Fv2rr (resistant to Friend erythroleukemia virus), as shown by 3H-thymidine or hydroxyurea ""cell suicide"" experiments in vivo and vitro. When bone marrow cells from these mice were subjected to a single wash in alpha medium, the proportion of BFU-E synthesizing DNA dramatically rose to levels as high as those normally seen among the BFU-E of congenic B6.S mice of genotype Fv2ss (sensitive to Friend erythroleukemia virus). Washing Fv2rr marrow cells did not significantly affect the proportion of CFU-S, CFU-nm (CFU-C) or CFU-E engaged in DNA synthesis. An activity responsible for keeping low the proportion of BFU-E in DNA synthesis was recovered in supernatants of FV2rr (but not FV2ss) bone marrow cells; its effect could be demonstrated on the BFU-E of either Fv2rr of Fv2ss washed bone marrow cells. This activity was nontoxic to the BFU-E, rapidly reversible and effective at, but not far below, the concentrations normally found in adult Fv2rr marrow. It was stable to 56 degrees C for 30 min, was nondialyzable, appeared in the void volume on G-25 Sephadex gel filtration and could be filtered through membranes that permitted passage of particles of less than 100,000 but not less than 50,000 daltons. Thus the Fv2 locus (or a locus closely linked to it) appears to act not in the BFU-E itself, but elsewhere, to control the amount or activity of a macromolecular negative regulator to which the BFU-E population responds by a reduction in the proportion synthesizing DNA. This study reveals the existence of a negative growth control mechanism for early erythropoietic progenitor cells, which is apparently physiological in nature and under strict genetic control.","Axelrad, A A;Croizat, H;Eskinazi, D"
6277496,1981,Cell,Replication of viral DNA sequences integrated within the chromatin of SV40-transformed Chinese hamster lung cells.,"To determine when during S phase integrated viral DNA sequences in several tsA SV40-transformed Chinese hamster cell clones replicate, we pulse-labeled cultures with BrdUrd and subsequently collected mitotic cells during sequential time intervals. Restriction endonuclease mapping indicated that each of the three SV40-transformed Chinese hamster lung cell clones contained a single viral DNA sequence at a different, but in each case unique, chromosomal site. DNA was extracted from each population of mitotic cells and then was resolved into dense, BrdUrd-containing and light, unsubstituted DNA fractions by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. In each pair of samples obtained, we measured viral DNA sequences by solution hybridization using single-stranded SV40 32P-labeled DNA probes. Our results support the conclusions that specific genes within a mammalian DNA are programmed to replicate at particular times during S phase, and that the SV40 A gene product, large T antigen, programs integrated viral DNA sequences to replicate very early in S phase. The fractions of viral DNA replicated early in S phase appeared to correlate with each clone's content of functional large T antigen at permissive and nonpermissive culture temperatures.","Marchionni, M A;Roufa, D J"
6276011,1981,Cell,Harvey and Kirsten sarcoma viruses promote the growth and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells in vitro.,"Harvey and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses have previously been shown to transform fibroblastic cells in culture, and type C virus pseudotypes of these viruses cause erythroleukemia in susceptible mice. We report a cell culture assay for quantitating the growth-promoting effect of Harvey and Kirsten viruses on erythroid cells. Murine hemopoietic cells were infected in vitro with Harvey or Kirsten sarcoma virus, and then cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of relatively low concentrations of erythropoietin. Under these conditions, large colonies of erythroid cells form in the semi-solid culture media 6 to 8 days after infection. The induction of erythroid bursts was not caused by the murine type C helper viruses used to pseudotype either Ha-MuSV or Ki-MuSV, or by media from cells carrying the Ki-MuSV and Ha-MuSV genomes. Induction of the erythroid colonies is under genetic control at the Fv1 susceptibility locus, but not at the Fv2 susceptibility locus. A striking feature of the erythroid colonies induced by the Harvey and Kirsten viruses was that they not only proliferated to large size but also differentiated along the erythroid lineage and synthesized hemoglobin. The results indicate that Ha-MuSV and Ki-MuSV can induce proliferation of erythroid precursor cells apparently without interfering with the differentiation program of the cells. The relation between the growth-promotion effect of these viruses on erythroid precursor cells and their ability to induce erythroleukemia is discussed.","Hankins, W D;Scolnick, E M"
6276010,1981,Cell,Abelson leukemia virus induces lymphoid and erythroid colonies in infected fetal cell cultures.,"An examination of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuL V)-hematopoietic cell interaction in cultures of fetal tissues reveals that A-MuLV can stimulate the formation of two different types of colonies. One type of colony is white and composed of A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells that can develop into established cell lines. These cells are indistinguishable in morphology from typical adult-derived lymphoid transformants. The second type of colony is pink or red and composed of erythroid cells in various stages of differentiation. Although A-MuLV is required to induce the erythroid colonies, and at least some cells in all of these colonies are infected with the virus, no permanently growing cell lines have been established from the cells in these colonies. The frequency of the two types of colonies varies depending upon the tissue and the gestational age of the embryo. Erythroid colonies are found following infection of early and mid gestation tissues while lymphoid colonies are found following infection of mid and late gestation tissues. Mixing experiments indicate that the two types of colonies arise from distinct target cells. Because A-MuLV mutants that are defective for lymphoid cell transformation are also defective for erythroid colony induction, expression of a functional Abelson protein is probably required for colony induction. Thus A-MuLV is capable of stimulating the cells of two distinct hematopoietic lineages. In one case, infection leads to transformation, while in the second, it leads to growth and differentiation. Both types of interaction are mediated, at least in part, by the same A-MuLV gene product, a molecule previously considered to induce transformation in all stably infected cells.","Waneck, G L;Rosenberg, N"

Molecularly cloned bas sequences demonstrated no detectable homology with the onc genes of other mouse transforming viruses, but exhibited a high degree of sequence homology with the ras gene of the rat-derived Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) genome. The Ha-MuSV cell-derived sequence (ras) shared a colinear 750 bp region of homology with bas. Moreover, BALB-MuSV transformation was associated with the expression of high levels of a 21,000 dalton protein, immunologically related to the ras gene products, p21. Thus bas and ras represent retroviral transforming gene homologs that were independently transduced by mouse type C viruses from the genomes of different species.","Andersen, P R;Devare, S G;Tronick, S R;Ellis, R W;Aaronson, S A;Scolnick, E M"
6269750,1981,Cell,Cloning and characterization of the integrated viral DNA from three lines of SV40-transformed mouse cells.,"Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to isolate the integrated viral DNA, together with flanking cellular sequences, from three independently isolated lines of SV40-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells. We have determined the structures of these cloned segments and their relationships to one another by restriction enzyme mapping, electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis and transfer hybridization experiments. Our data indicate that the structure of the integrated viral DNA is consistent with the idea that integration involves a tandemly repeated intermediate, that extensive amplification and rearrangement of viral and adjacent cellular sequences occurs after integration and that the majority of viral DNA insertions do not contain an intact early transcription unit. The altered templates presumably encode the truncated and super T antigens found in these cells. Either they are interrupted in the middle of the early region, in which case they generally retain the region in which tsA mutations map, or they contain tandem duplications of the tsA region. Further structural analysis will allow the prediction of the precise structures of these unusual T antigens, and the availability of the corresponding templates opens the way to an analysis of the functions of these proteins.","Clayton, C E;Rigby, P W"
6269747,1981,Cell,Avian reticuloendotheliosis virus: identification of the hematopoietic target cell for transformation.,"Non-virus-producing hematopoietic cells transformed in vitro by reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV-T) induce lethal ""reticuloendotheliosis"" when inoculated into histocompatible chickens. This is the first direct demonstration that an in vivo target cell of an avian acute leukemia virus can be transformed in vitro. The tumorigenic, REV-T-transformed non-virus-producing cells fail to express helper-virus-coded proteins. REV-T transformed tumorigenic cells therefore do not require helper-virus functions. Cells transformed in vivo or in vitro by REV-T have lymphoblastoid morphology and express low levels of terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase activity and bursal-cell determinants. One clone synthesized Ig mu. The preferred target cells for REV-T transformation are therefore immature lymphoid cells that express B-cell determinants. We propose that the unique transforming sequence of REV-T be designated rel (lymphoid).","Lewis, R B;McClure, J;Rup, B;Niesel, D W;Garry, R F;Hoelzer, J D;Nazerian, K;Bose, H R"

Cell DNA from primary foci can be used in a subsequent cycle of transfection resulting in secondary foci that contain relatively little human DNA. Secondary foci appear to contain only the human sequences proximal to those responsible for the transformed phenotype. A set of characteristic DNA restriction fragments is found in common among secondary foci derived from each tumor cell line DNA.

6268304,1981,Cell,Retroviruses as mutagens: insertion and excision of a nontransforming provirus alter expression of a resident transforming provirus.,"Integration of retroviral DNA appears to occur randomly in host genomes, suggesting that retroviruses can act as insertion mutagens. We have confirmed this prediction by showing that the nontransforming retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), can insert its provirus within the selectable target provided by a single provirus in a clonal rat cell line (B31) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Analysis of over 60 morphological revertants of M-MuLV-superinfected B31 cells revealed two lines with inserts of M-MuLV proviruses within the RSV provirus but outside the transforming gene of RSV (src), at sites 0.6 and 4.0 kb from the 5' end. The inserts did not inactivate initiation of RSV RNA synthesis but did affect elongation or processing, or both, generating species with the 5' end of RSV RNA linked to sequences that presumably derive from the inserted M-MuLV DNA. In one mutant line, most of the insert was excised at low frequency, apparently by homologous recombination between repeated sequences at the ends of M-MuLV DNA. After excision, RSV src mRNA was present in normal amounts, and the cells resumed a transformed appearance. In at least four independent lines, large portions of the left end of the RSV provirus (from 1 to 6 kb) and variable amounts of leftward flanking cellular DNA (from 0.5 to 10-15 kb or more) were deleted, without nearby insertions of M-MuLV NA. The deletions removed the putative promoter for synthesis of RSV RNA; in the two cases examined, no RSV RNA was detected. These deletions may represent a second mutational effect of the superinfection by M-MuLV.","Varmus, H E;Quintrell, N;Ortiz, S"
7249080,1981,Cell,M-MuLV-induced leukemogenesis: integration and structure of recombinant proviruses in tumors.,"M-MuLV-specific DNA probes were used to establish the state of integration and amplification of recombinant proviral sequences in Moloney virus-induced tumors of Balb/Mo, Balb/c and 129 mice. The somatically acquired viral sequences contain both authentic M-MuLV genomes and recombinants of M-MuLV with endogenous viral sequences. All reintegrated genomes carry long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences at both termini of their genome. In the preleukemic stage a large population of cells exhibiting a random distribution of reintegrated M-MuLV genomes are seen, but during outgrowth of the tumor, selection of cells occurs leaving one or a few clonal descendants in the outgrown tumor. In this latter stage recombinant genomes can be detected. Although these recombinants constitute a heterogeneous group of proviruses, characteristic molecular markers are conserved among many individual proviral recombinants, lending credence to the notion that a certain recombinant structure is a prerequisite for the onset of neoplasia. The structure of these recombinants shows close structural similarities to the previously described mink cell focus-inducing (MCF)-type viruses.","van der Putten, H;Quint, W;van Raaij, J;Maandag, E R;Verma, I M;Berns, A"
6166390,1981,Cell,Progressive loss of shape-responsive metabolic controls in cells with increasingly transformed phenotype.,"The modulation of cell metabolism by cell shape and external surface contact has been studied by suspension culture of anchorage-dependent fibroblasts. The suspended cells shut down protein synthesis and nuclear RNA metabolism and cease replicating DNA. However, these responses to suspension are lost or modified as cells become progressively transformed in behavior. We compare the metabolic consequences of suspension culture in five related types of fibroblasts: the well regulated mouse diploid fibroblast; the spontaneously immortalized and progressively less well regulated lines 3T3, 3T6 and HDP3T6; and the fully transformed anchorage-independent SVPy3T3. Protein synthesis is inhibited rapidly following suspension in diploid fibroblasts and more slowly in the less well regulated cells. In contrast, the response of hnRNA synthesis to suspension is lost completely when cells adopt the 3T6 phenotype, and message regulation is lost in HDP3T6. The prompt inhibition of ribosomal RNA precursor is modified to a slow decline in HDP3T6. The metabolism of fully transformed SVPy3T3 cells is indifferent to suspension. The progressive loss of shape-responsive controls may be related to tumor progression.","Wittelsberger, S C;Kleene, K;Penman, S"
7237558,1981,Cell,Chromosomal position and activation of retroviral genomes inserted into the germ line of mice.,"The exogenous Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was inserted into the germ line of mice by exposing embryos to virus at different stages of embryogenesis. Mice derived from exposed embryos were mosaics with respect to integrated virus. Nine new substrains, designated Mov-5 to Mov-13, were derived, each of which carries a single M-MuLV genome at a different chromosomal position in its germ line. Four substrains, Mov-1 to Mov-4, were derived previously. Restriction enzyme analyses demonstrated that, with the exception of Mov-4 and Mov-6 mice, no major rearrangements or deletions have occurred in the integrated proviral genomes. Infectious virus is not activated in the majority of substrains (Mov-4 to Mov-8 and Mov-10 to Mov-12), whereas the other mice develop viremia. A detailed comparison between Mov-1 and Mov-13 mice demonstrated that the time of virus activation is different. Mov-13 mice activate infectious virus during embryogenesis, leading to a distinct pattern of virus expression in all tissues of the adult, but the viral genome in Mov-1 mice is activated only during the first two weeks after birth, leading to virus expression predominantly in lymphatic organs. Together with previous observations, at least four different phenotypes of virus expression-that is, early virus activation during embryogenesis, virus activation after birth, virus activation late in life and no expression of infectious virus at all-can be distinguished among the 13 substrains. Our results suggest that the chromosomal region at which a viral genome is integrated influences its expression during development and differentiation.","Jaenisch, R;Jähner, D;Nobis, P;Simon, I;Löhler, J;Harbers, K;Grotkopp, D"
7237557,1981,Cell,Lipid composition and lateral diffusion in plasma membranes of teratocarcinoma-derived cell lines.,"We measured lipid lateral diffusion rates for a series of teratocarcinoma-derived and embryo-derived cell lines, using the technique of fluorescence photobleaching recovery with a fluorescent lipid probe, C16dil. The probe diffuses more rapidly in plasma membranes of embryonal carcinoma cells than in plasma membranes of teratocarcinoma-derived endodermal cell lines. When embryonal carcinoma cells are induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid, diffusion constants of C16dil are reduced to levels typical of endoderm. These changes are paralleled by differences in membrane cholesterol content; membrane free cholesterol levels in embryonal carcinoma lines are approximately half those found in endodermal lines, and are markedly increased upon retinoic-acid-induced differentiation.","Searls, D B;Edidin, M"
6786758,1981,Cell,A transmembrane relationship between fibronectin and vinculin (130 kd protein): serum modulation in normal and transformed hamster fibroblasts.,"Using electron microscopy, we had previously demonstrated a very close transmembrane relationship between actin microfilaments and fibronectin fibrils, termed the fibronexus. Since vinculin, a recently discovered intracellular protein, is localized at the membrane-insertion regions of actin fibers, we studied its possible relationship to fibronectin and the fibronexus. Using double-label immunofluorescence microscopy, we have observed that the distributions of vinculin and fibronectin are strikingly coincident in normal Nil 8 hamster fibroblasts arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and in HSV-transformed Nil hamster cells treated with purified fibronectin after culturing in 0.3% serum. Extensively spread Nil 8 cells have numerous vinculin-positive focal patches, which are localized either directly over or in tandem with fibronectin fibers at the ventral surface. However, fibronectin and vinculin do not exhibit this relationship in Nil 8 cells grown in 5% serum. These vinculin patches closely resemble the vinculin plaques that Geiger found to be dark under interference-reflection microscopy, suggesting that fibronectin is associated with substrate-adhesion plaques in arrested cells. Fibronectin treatment of the HSV-transformed Nil cells cultured in a low concentration of serum results in the formation of ventral microprocesses, exhibiting an extraordinary congruence of vinculin and fibronectin staining. In addition, these cells bind matrix-like arrangements of fibronectin on their dorsal surface at sites of cell-cell interaction that are vinculin-negative. These results imply that two distinct types of fibronexuses may exist: a ventral substrate-adhesive nexus consisting of fibronectin, vinculin and actin, and a dorsal association matrix fibers. Transmembrane vinculin-fibronectin associations are evidently sensitive to the growth state of the cell.","Singer, I I;Paradiso, P R"
6263500,1981,Cell,Genome of a mononucleosis Epstein-Barr virus contains DNA fragments previously regarded to be unique to Burkitt's lymphoma isolates.,"We wished to learn whether the genomes of strains of EMB isolated from patients with infectious mononucleosis are consistently distinguishable from those of strains from Burkitt's lymphoma. The genome of a new transforming strains (FF41) of EBV isolated from saliva of a patient with uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis was compared with the DNA of B95-8, the only other available virus from mononucleosis. It had been found previously that B95-8 has a deletion of about 8 Md in the region of the physical map represented by the Eco RI C, Hind III D, and Bam HI I fragments. The W91 and HR-1 isolates for Burkitt's lymphoma are not deleted in this region and it had been proposed that additional information was characteristic of EBV isolates from Burkitt's lymphoma. By means of restriction enzyme analysis, blot hybridization experiments and molecular cloning of FF41 DNA we demonstrate that the deletion found in B95-8 is not present in the new mononucleosis isolate. The FF41 genome contains an extra 8 Md of DNA, represented by Bam HI fragments B', W' and I', which are located in a larger Eco RI C fragment. Thus the genome of this salivary isolate contains DNA that had previously been regarded to be unique to strains from Burkitt's lymphoma. It is therefore unlikely that major insertions or deletions in the EBV genome account for differences in disease manifestation following EBV infection.","Fischer, D K;Miller, G;Gradoville, L;Heston, L;Westrate, M W;Maris, W;Wright, J;Brandsma, J;Summers, W C"
6263499,1981,Cell,Molecular cloning and characterization of the chicken gene homologous to the transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus.,"Four molecular clones containing DNA homologous to the Rous sarcoma virus transforming gene (src) have been isolated from a random library of normal chicken DNA. The four clones are distinct overlapping isolates, which together span approximately 33 kb of cellular DNA. The clones locus appears to represent the major region of chicken DNA homologous to src, since src-containing restriction fragments of this locus account for the fragments detected by hybridization of src-specific probe to restriction digests of total chicken DNA. Analysis of the cloned chicken src locus by restriction and heteroduplex mapping indicates that the locus contains 1.6-1.9 kb of DNA homologous to the viral src gene. The chicken DNA sequences homologous to viral src are interrupted by five or six nonhomologous regions, totaling approximately 6 kb, which presumably represent introns in the cellular src gene.","Shalloway, D;Zelenetz, A D;Cooper, G M"
7237541,1981,Cell,Cloning of DNA from double minutes of Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells: evidence for gene amplification.,"We have isolated a metaphase chromosome fraction highly enriched in double minutes (dm) from a mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (Y1-DM). We have cloned DNA from this dm-enriched fraction in the lambda vector Charon 4A, and have characterized two randomly chosen recombinant bacteriophage clones from this dm DNA library. When 32 P-labeled DNA from each recombinant was hybridized to Southern blots of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA from different mouse cell lines, large differences were seen in the intensity of the resulting autoradiographic images, depending on the source of the genomic DNA. A very strong signal was obtained with DNA from the Y1-DM cells and with DNA from a related Y1 subline that lacks dm but contains a marker chromosome bearing a large homogeneously staining region (HSR). Hybridization to DNA from parental inbred mice and from two unrelated mouse cell lines produced a significantly weaker signal than that obtained with DNA from the Y1 cells, but the DNA fragments from the sources were of similar size. Based on results from filter hybridization analysis, we estimate that sequences homologous to the cloned fragments are approximately 100- to 200-fold more abundant in the genome of the Y1-DM cells than in the parental mouse cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that dm and HSRs in these cells contain amplified genes.","George, D L;Powers, V E"
6263486,1981,Cell,Early changes in the distribution and organization of microfilament proteins during cell transformation.,"During the onset of transformation, Rous sarcoma virus-infected cells undergo characteristic morphological changes that reflect the biochemical events induced by the viral src gene. Temperature downshift experiments using chick embryo cells infected with transformation-defective temperature-sensitive viral mutants have shown two major morphological changes occurring at different times in the transformation process: ruffle-like flowers appear on the dorsal cell surface as early as 15 min after temperature shift, while later, between 6 and 12 hr, cytoskeletal stress fibers disappear and the cells round up. We report that flowers contain large accumulations of the cytoskeletal proteins actin, alpha-actinin, myosin and tropomyosin. Furthermore, since flowers stain very intensely with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, a cyclopeptide that selectively binds to F-actin and not to G-actin, we suggest that these structures result from an early reorganization of microfilaments.","Boschek, C B;Jockusch, B M;Friis, R R;Back, R;Grundmann, E;Bauer, H"
6263485,1981,Cell,Vinculin: a cytoskeletal target of the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus.,"Vinculin, a protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the focal adhesion plaques which anchor actin-containing microfilaments to the plasma membrane and attach a cell to the substratum, contains 8-fold more phosphotyrosine in cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus than in uninfected cells. Because the transforming protein of RSV, p60src, is a protein kinase that modifies cellular proteins through the phosphorylation of tyrosine and because phosphotyrosine is a very rare modified amino acid, this result is a very rare modified amino acid, this result suggests that vinculin is a primary substrate of p60src. Only trace amounts of phosphotyrosine were detected in myosin heavy chains, alpha-actinin, filamin, and the intermediate filament protein vimentin. The modification of vinculin by p60src may be responsible in part for the disruption of the microfilament organization and for the changes in cell shape and adhesiveness which accompany transformation by Rous sarcoma virus.","Sefton, B M;Hunter, T;Ball, E H;Singer, S J"
6263484,1981,Cell,Viral and cellular src genes contribute to the structure of recovered avian sarcoma virus transforming protein.,"Recovered avian sarcoma viruses (rASVs) were obtained from tumors induced by certain transformation-defective (td) mutants of Schmidt-Ruppin strain Rous sarcoma virus of subgroup A (SR-A). The genomes of these td SR-A mutants lack most but not all of the src gene. rASV genomes, however, possess intact src genes, which are largely derived from cellular genetic information, presumably an endogenous cellular gene called c-src, which shares considerable homology with the viral src. To further define the genetic origin of rASV src, we examined by tryptic peptide analysis the product of this gene, pp60src, from rASV and SR-A, as well as the normal cellular homolog pp60c-src. We found peptides unique to each putative ""parental"" protein present together in maps of rASV p60src, demonstrating that the endogenous cellular c-src gene itself contributes to the structure of rASV pp60src. Certain isolates of rASV encode pp60srcS of altered apparent molecular weight. In these cases, the variation in structure was located in the amino-terminal portion of the protein. That such polymorphism can be tolerated suggests that this region of the protein is less critical to the ability of these agents to transform cells.","Karess, R E;Hanafusa, H"
6263483,1981,Cell,Transforming proteins of some feline and avian sarcoma viruses are related structurally and functionally.,"Transformation of chicken cells by Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV), PRC II or Y73 (three independently isolated avian sarcoma viruses that are replication-defective and lack the Rous sarcoma virus src gene) resulted in significant elevation (4-13 fold) of phosphotyrosine levels in cellular protein. The gag-related proteins encoded by these avian sarcoma viruses (ASVs) were all associated with tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity when assayed in immune complexes and were phosphorylated at both tyrosine and serine residues in vivo. Both the phosphotyrosine level in protein of FSV-infected cells and the protein kinase activity assayed in immune complexes containing the FSV protein P140 were temperature-sensitive. The presumed transforming proteins of these ASVs were compared with those of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), Abelson murine leukemia virus and the Snyder-Theilen and Gardner-Arnstein strains of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), which have previously been associated with tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. FSV and PRC II proteins were shown to be structurally related to one another and to the FeSV proteins by tryptic peptide mapping and by immunological studies. No homology was observed, however, between the transforming proteins of RSV, Y73, Abelson murine leukemia virus and the FSV/PRC II/FeSV class, suggesting there may be at least four classes of retroviruses whose transformation mechanisms involve aberrant phosphorylation of cellular protein at tyrosine residues.","Beemon, K"
6261958,1981,Cell,Loss of tumorigenicity correlates with a reduction in pp60src kinase activity in a revertant subclone of avian sarcoma virus-infected field vole cells.,"We have recently isolated an interesting revertant subclone (revertant 866-4) of ESV-infected field vole cells that is indistinguishable from uninfected vole cells with respect to its lack of transformed cell properties. These revertants are not only normal morphologically, but they do not grow in soft agar and are nontumorigenic in athymic nude mice. Despite this lack of transformed cell properties, we have found that this cell line still contains pp60src at concentrations (0.30 microgram/mg cell protein) similar to those (0.13-0.42 microgram/mg cell protein) found in transformed and morphologically reverted, but tumorigenic vole cells (partial revertants). However, the most interesting aspect of this newly isolated subclone is the marked reduction in its pp60src kinase activity (2--3%) when compared with the specific activity of pp60src immunoprecipitated from transformed and partially revertant vole cell lines. Since the reduction in pp60src kinase activity strongly correlates with the loss of tumorigenicity in this particular revertant cell line, these data support the contention that this enzymatic activity is a crucial factor in the tumorigenic conversion of cells by avian sarcoma virus. Proteolytic peptide analysis of the structure of pp60src from revertant 866-4 indicates that it is similar to pp60src obtained from avian sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, the reduction in kinase activity does not appear to be due to a lack of phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in pp60src. Thus neither an obvious structural alteration nor a reduction in phosphorylation of pp60src appears responsible for the reduced kinase activity observed, suggesting that some as of yet undetermined feature of pp60src can influence the pp60src phosphorylating event.","Lau, A F;Krzyzek, R A;Faras, A J"
6261957,1981,Cell,Mutation near the polyoma DNA replication origin permits productive infection of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells.,"F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells are resistant to productive infection by wild-type polyoma virus. Continued passage of F9 cells initially infected with wild-type polyoma virus eventually leads to the selection of polyoma virus mutants that are capable of productive infection of undifferentiated F9 cells. Three mutants, PyF101, PyF111 and PyF441, have been plaque-purified and examined. All three PyF mutant DNAs are altered from the wild-type sequence in the Pvu II-4 fragment that spans 67.6 to 70.2 map units on the polyoma genome. PyF441 has a single base change of A to G at 69.6 map units. PyF101 and PyF111 DNAs also contain this point mutation at 69.6 map units. In addition, PyF101 and PyF111 DNAs have exact tandem duplications of 54 and 31 bp, respectively, of sequences encompassing the point mutation, and both copies of the tandem duplication have the point mutation. Other than these changes, no difference exists in the nucleotide sequences of wild-type and PyF mutant DNAs from the BcI I site at 65.6 map units clockwise through the origin of viral DNA replication to the BgI I site at 72.2 map units. DNA infections of F9 cells with wild-type-mutant hybrid DNAs formed by ligation of heterologous combinations of the small and large DNA fragments generated by double digestion with the restriction enzymes BcII and BGI I show that the DNA sequence changes described above are responsible for the ability of the PyF mutants to infect F9 cells.","Fujimura, F K;Deininger, P L;Friedmann, T;Linney, E"
6258798,1981,Cell,Avian leukosis virus-induced tumors have common proviral integration sites and synthesize discrete new RNAs: oncogenesis by promoter insertion.,"Unlike other RNA tumor viruses, avian leukosis viruses (which cause lymphomas and occasionally other neoplasms) lack discrete ""transforming genes"". We have analyzed the virus-related DNA and RNA of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced tumors in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of ALV oncogenesis. Our results show that viral gene products are not required for maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Primary and metastatic tumors are clonal and thus presumably derived from a single infected cell. Most importantly, tumors from different birds have integration sites in common. Tumor cells synthesize discrete new poly(A) RNAs consisting of viral sequences covalently linked to cellular sequences. These RNA species are expressed at high levels in tumor cells. Our results suggest that in lymphoid tumors, an ALV provirus is integrated adjacent to a specific cellular gene, and the insertion of the viral promoter adjacent to this gene results in its enhanced expression, leading to neoplasia. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of non-viral carcinogenesis.","Neel, B G;Hayward, W S;Robinson, H L;Fang, J;Astrin, S M"
6258797,1981,Cell,Analysis of avian leukosis virus DNA and RNA in bursal tumours: viral gene expression is not required for maintenance of the tumor state.,"Each of twelve tumors induced by either Rous-associated virus-1 or -2 (RAV-1 or RAV-2) contained a predominant population of cells with ALV proviruses integrated at common sites, consistent with a clonal origin. Seven of nine RAV-2-induced bursal tumors contained single proviruses, and all seven solitary proviruses had suffered deletions. The detailed structures of four of these proviruses show that major deletions had occurred near or at the 5' ends, spanning sequences potentially important in the production of viral RNA. One provirus also lacked most of the information coding for the replicative functions of the virus. Restriction maps suggest that these four proviruses were inserted in similar regions of the host genome. We have studied virus-specific RNA in four bursal tumors and four cell lines derived from bursal tumors. No normal viral RNA species were detectable in three tumors containing single aberrant proviruses. However, transcripts of 2.2. kb which reacted only with a hybridization probe specific for the 5' end of viral RNA were observed in one of these three tumors. Analogous species, varying in length from 1.5 to 6.0 kb, were observed in a fourth bursal tumor with multiple proviruses and in all four cell lines. (This tumor and the cell lines also contained normal species of ALV mRNA and apparently normal proviral DNA). The structures of the aberrant proviruses and the absence of normal viral RNA in some tumors indicate that expression of viral genes is not required for maintenance of the tumor phenotype. In at least some cases, the mechanism of oncogenesis may involve stimulation of transcription of flanking cellular sequences by a viral promoter.","Payne, G S;Courtneidge, S A;Crittenden, L B;Fadly, A M;Bishop, J M;Varmus, H E"
6260381,1981,Cell,Integration of Rous sarcoma virus DNA during transfection.,"We have investigated the organization and integration sites of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) DNA in NIH 3T3 mouse cells transformed by transfection with unintegrated and integrated donor RSV DNAs. RSV DNAs of different cell lines transformed by unintegrated donor DNA were flanked by different cellular DNA sequences, indicating that RSV DNA integrates at multiple sites during transfection. The RSV genomes of cells transformed by transfection were colinear with unintegrated RSV DNA, except that deletions within the terminal repeat units of RSV DNA were detected in some cell lines. These results suggested that the terminal repeat sequences of RSV DNA did not necessarily provide a specific integration site for viral DNA during transfection. In addition, cell lines transformed by integrated RSV DNAs contained both the RSV genomes and flanking cellular sequences of the parental cell lines, indicating that integration of integrated viral DNA during transfection occurred by recombinational events within flanking cellular DNA sequences rather than at the terminal of viral DNA. Integration of RSV DNA during transfection thus appears to differ from integration of RSV DNA in virus-infected cells, where the terminal repeat units of viral DNA provide a highly specific integration site. Integration of donor DNA during transfection of NIH 3T3 cells instead appears to proceed by a pathway which is nonspecific for both donor and recipient DNA sequences.","Copeland, N G;Jenkins, N A;Cooper, G M"
6260380,1981,Cell,Genomic rearrangements in a mouse cell line containing integrated SV40 DNA.,"In the SV40-transformed mouse embryo fibroblast cell line SVT2/S, genomic rearrangements involving the SV40 DNA and flanking host sequences were identified by Southern blot hybridization using viral DNA as probe. No rearrangements of SV40 DNA integrated into nonpermissive mouse cells have been previously described. The standard arrangement found in the majority of subclones was mapped with 20 restriction enzymes, 10 of which cleave sites within the SV40 DNA. A single copy of a defective integrated viral genome is present, in which the late region is missing from about nucleotide 200 clockwise to about nucleotide 1750. The rest of the viral genome including the origin of replication and T antigen binding region is present and colinear with SV40 DNA, except for an internal repeat of about 1750 bp located between nucleotides 2750 and 4500. Rearrangements were found in 4 out of 20 random subclones of the parental SVT2/S cell line and 3 of the 4 continued to rearrange. The thioguanine-resistant cell line 281-1-4, derived from SVT2/S, remained stable on subculture but a chloramphenicol-resistant mutant, 107-6-4, derived from 281-1-4, was highly unstable. In 107-6-4, unique rearrangements were found in 6 of 31 subclones of a population that had undergone abut 25 doublings from a single-cell isolate. The high rate of rearrangement and the sporadic expression of rearrangement potential are characteristic of the transposable controlling elements discovered by McClintock.","Sager, R;Anisowicz, A;Howell, N"

Three transformed lines (COS-1, -3, -7) were established and found to contain T antigen; retain complete permissiveness for lytic growth of SV40; support the replication of tsA209 virus at 40 degrees C; and support the replication of pure populations of SV40 mutants with deletions in the early region. One of the lines (COS-1) contains a single integrated copy of the complete early region of SV40 DNA. These cells are possible hosts for the propagation of pure populations of recombinant SV40 viruses.","Gluzman, Y"
6260372,1981,Cell,Mammary tumor induction loci in GR and DBAf mice contain one provirus of the mouse mammary tumor virus.,"The mammary tumor induction genes Mtv-1 in mouse strain DBAf and Mtv-2 in strain GR control the complete expression of the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We have used a combination of genetic, biochemical and molecular biological methods to identify and correlate specific copies of the endogenous MMTV proviral genes with the biological properties of the tumor induction genes Mtv-1 and Mtv-2. These Mtv induction genes contain specific MMTV proviral information, as was concluded from restriction enzyme analysis and molecular hybridization of DNAs of congenic mouse strains and of progenitors of backcross populations. The congenic strains differed from the parental strains GR and 020 only in the Mtv-2 gene, one lacking the Mtv-2 gene (GR/Mtv-2-) and one having obtained this gene (020/Mtv-2+). The gain or loss coincided with two Eco RI cellular DNA fragments containing MMTV DNA information. Since Eco RI cuts the exogenous proviral variant of MMTV DNA once, we assume that these two cellular DNA fragments contain one MMTV provirus. The same cellular DNA fragments containing MMTV DNA information segregated together with MMTV expression in the offspring population of the backcross. In a similar backcross analysis of the induction gene Mtv-1 it was also demonstrated that the Mtv-1 gene comprises one MMTV provirus. These data indicate that Mtv induction genes contain specific but different MMTV proviral genes and that nly a limited number of the MMTV proviruses present in the cellular DNA is associated with the control of proviral expression.","Michalides, R;van Nie, R;Nusse, R;Hynes, N E;Groner, B"
6260371,1981,Cell,Nucleotide sequence of acceptor site and termini of integrated avian endogenous provirus ev1: integration creates a 6 bp repeat of host DNA.,"The nucleotide sequences at the junctions between host cellular and integrated proviral DNA at the chicken endogenous retrovirus locus ev1 have been determined. These sequences have been compared with that of a DNA fragment presumed to contain the acceptor site for integration of the provirus at this locus. The results show that the integrated ev1 provirus contains a long terminal repeat (LTR) of 273 base pairs (bp). The left and right LTR are identical and contain sequences similar to proposed transcription control signals. In addition, there is a direct repeat of 6 bp of host DNA immediately flanking each provirus terminus. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment that contains the unoccupied acceptor site is identical to that which flanks the ev1 provirus, except that the 6 bp sequence occurs only once. We propose that the repeat was produced during integration by a mechanism similar to that of procaryotic and eucaryotic transposable genetic elements. This and other similarities in structure suggest a common evolution and mode of function for these movable genetic elements.","Hishinuma, F;DeBona, P J;Astrin, S;Skalka, A M"
6936081,1980,Cell,Polycythemia- and anemia-inducing erythroleukemia viruses exhibit differential erythroid transforming effects in vitro.,"The transforming capabilities of FVA, RLV and FVP have been examined using an in vitro transformation assay. Treatment of bone marrow cells with FVP in vitro led to the formation of hemoglobinized erythroid bursts even when these cells were cultured in methylcellulose for 5 days without added erythropoietin (Epo). A variety of FVA and RLV preparations also produced erythroid bursts without Epo but these bursts contained significantly less hemoglobin than those induced by FVP. When very low levels of Epo were added to cultures of FVA- and RLV-infected cells, the bursts were hemoglobinized, that is, similar to FVP-induced bursts. The burst-inducing agent in FVA preparations was shown to be a virus and not Epo. Spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) pseudotypes, derived from FVA or FVP, also produced erythroid bursts in vitro, whereas four helper murine leukemia viruses did not. These studies indicated that the SFFV component was essential for erythroid burst transformation and specified the degree of hemoglobinization in the bursts formed.","Hankins, W D;Troxler, D"

HUT 14 cells have an altered actin phenotype. In addition to the two nonmuscle actins beta and gamma, also present in the parent KD cells, they show the stable expression of a novel actin species (Ax-actin). Amino acid sequence analysis has been used to identify the three actins of HUT 14 cells. beta- and gamma-actins are identified as normal mammalian nonmuscle actins whereas Ax-actin is characterized as a beta-actin mutant revealing a single amino acid substitution at position 244. The results obtained are compatible with a simple mutational event involving a point mutation in one of the two beta-nonmuscle actin genes assumed to be present in proliferating human diploid fibroblasts. Certain emerging principles of nonmuscle actin gene expression in higher vertebrates are discussed.","Vandekerckhove, J;Leavitt, J;Kakunaga, T;Weber, K"
6257400,1980,Cell,Integration sites and sequence arrangement of SV40 DNA in a homogeneous series of transformed rat fibroblast lines.,"The state and organization of viral DNA sequences present in independently isolated rat cell lines transformed with SV40 were investigated using restriction-enzyme cleavage of the cellular DNA and blot hybridization with a viral probe. The transformed lines were established under conditions as identical as possible, except for a limited number of variables (multiplicity of infection, physiological state of the cells after infection and procedures used for selecting the transformed derivatives). They were characterized after a limited number of generations in culture. Two distinct types of organization were found: covalently integrated viral genomes were present either as single inserts or as head-to-tail oligomeric structures. The latter was observed among transformants derived from cells maintained after infection under growth-inhibiting conditions (suspension in agarose medium, confluency on a solid substrate). Single inserts were observed only among cell lines isolated after an initial period of active growth. Recurrent patterns of hybridizaton were observed in independently isolated lines, indicating that the sites of the integrative recombinations were close enough, both in the viral and the cellular sequences, not to be distinguished at the level of sensitivity of the technique (more than +/- 100 bp). Among cell lines with multiple integration sites, only part of the inserts were found in several instances to be identical to inserts observed in other transformed lines.","Mougneau, E;Birg, F;Rassoulzadegan, M;Cuzin, F"
6257397,1980,Cell,A strain of Fujinami sarcoma virus which is temperature-sensitive in protein phosphorylation and cellular transformation.,"Cells infected by one strain of Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) are transformed at 38 degrees C but are phenotypically normal at 41.5 degrees C. FSV encodes a 140,000 molecular weight protein (P140) with gag gene-related and FSV-specific peptide sequences. At 41.5 degrees C, P140 is weakly phosphorylated at serine residues, and is inactive in the immune complex protein kinase assay. At 38 degrees C, P140 is highly phosphorylated, contains phosphotyrosine in addition to phosphoserine, and in the immune complex kinase assay becomes phosphorylated at three tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of cellular polypeptides at tyrosine residues in FSV-infected cells is also temperature-sensitive. These observations indicate that P140 is the transforming protein of FSV and that protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues is involved in transformation by this virus.","Pawson, T;Guyden, J;Kung, T H;Radke, K;Gilmore, T;Martin, G S"
6257396,1980,Cell,Characterization of protein kinase activity associated with the transforming gene product of Fujinami sarcoma virus.,"Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV), a newly characterized avian sarcoma virus, produces a protein of 140,000 daltons (p140) in infected cells. p140 is the product of a fused gene consisting of a part of the gag gene of avian retrovirus and FSV-unique sequences which are not related to the src sequences of Rous sarcoma virus. In vivo, p140 was found to be phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine residues. Immunoprecipitates of p140 with antiserum against gag gene-coded proteins had a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase activity which phosphorylated p140 itself, rabbit IgG of the immune complex and alpha-casein, an externally added soluble protein substrate. The phosphorylation was specific to tyrosine of the substrate proteins. p140 was phosphorylated in vitro at the same two tyrosine residues that were phosphorylated in vivo. The phosphate transferred to tyrosine residues of p140 forms a stable bond: it does not turn over during the kinase reaction, and the 32P-phosphate of p140 labeled in vitro or in vivo is not transferred to alpha-casein. FSV-p140 differs from p60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, in its marked preference of Mn2+ to Mg2+ ions, and in its inability to use GTP instead of ATP as the donor of gamma-phosphate.","Feldman, R A;Hanafusa, T;Hanafusa, H"
6257394,1980,Cell,Early precursors in the erythroid lineage are the specific target cells of avian erythroblastosis virus in vitro.,"In chickens the erythroid differentiation proceeds from stem cells to erythrocytes through several intermediate steps which have been identified in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) is able to transform in vitro either one or several types of these precursors, bone marrow cells were separated by physical and immunological methods. It was found that the target cells which could be transformed in vitro by AEV were cells of light density (1.060-1.065 g/cm3), having a modal sedimentation velocity at unit gravity between 4.0 and 6.0 mm/hr, expressing an immature antigen at a low level and a brain-related antigen at a high level. These results indicated that the target cells of neoplastic transformation by AEV were early erythroid precursors, since these precursors shared the same physical and immunological properties with AEV target cells.","Gazzolo, L;Samarut, J;Bouabdelli, M;Blanchet, J P"

When Faof1 cells are cultivated for 48 hr in the form of aggregates two cell types can be recovered from monolayer cultures established from the aggregates: the majority of cells are similar to the Faof1 parental line, but a new cell type (designated dag) that adheres only weakly to the substrate is present at a frequency of 2--12 X 10(-2). Eight dag populations and eight clones are characterized as being different from Faof1 cells by the production of serum albumin, aldolase B and in some cases activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase. No dag cells are recovered after 18 or 24 hours of aggregation, but after 48 or 96 hrs 1--5% of the cells give rise to clones of dag cells. During aggregation cells are committed to become dag cells but their new phenotype is expressed only after 5--12 days. The fraction of dag cells in colonies that grow out from aggregates suggests that dag transformation is not a clonal event. These experiments demonstrate that a transitory change in the culture conditions of Faof1 cells can lead to a heritable modification in phenotypic expression. Since dag cells fail to express the liver-specific gluconeogenic enzymes that permit cells to grow in glucose-free medium, it is possible to select from dag populations revertants in which expression of these activities is restored. The frequency of appearance of such dag revertants is not increased by the action of EMS.","Deschatrette, J"
6256084,1980,Cell,Amplification and rearrangement of integrated SV40 DNA sequences accompany the selection of anchorage-independent transformed mouse cells.,"Clones of SV40 tsA mutant-transformed mouse embryo cells with a temperature-independent transformed growth phenotype were derived from a parental line with a temperature-dependent growth phenotype, using the selective pressure of anchorage independent growth in agar at 40 degrees C. The parental J78 clone contained a complex tandem structure of integrated SV40 DNA within two cellular DNA fragments of 10 and 14 kb, generated by Bgl II digestion. The new clonal derivatives, in addition to an altered growth phenotype, displayed additional high molecular weight sites of SV40 DNA integration. A marked structural similarity among integration sites suggested that the new sites may have arisen by duplication and translocation of an original integration structure, or via an unequal crossover event. The rearrangement of viral DNA sequences appears to be specifically associated with the emergence of temperature-independent clones, since the isolation of new clones under nonselective conditions, that is, growth in semi-solid medium at 33 degrees C, was not accompanied by modification in cellular sequences containing SV40 DNA.","Hiscott, J;Murphy, D;Defendi, V"
6256083,1980,Cell,Changes in polypeptide pattern in ASV-transformed rat cells are correlated with the degree of morphological transformation.,"Normal rat kidney cells (NRK) have been transformed with an avian sarcoma virus (ASV) mutant that induces a temperature-sensitive transformed phenotype. When compared in vitro different ASV-transformed clones showed different degrees of morphological transformation at the permissive temperature, while they all reverted to normal at 39 degrees C. Comparisons of the polypeptide patterns of the different cells showed two things. First, a group of about 30 polypeptides, amounting to 5% of all the polypeptides analyzed in normal cells, were affected in all ASV-transformed clones and also in two papovavirus-transformed clones and also in two papovavirus-transformed NRK clones. Second, the patterns were found to differ between the clones in that varying numbers of polypeptides were found to be affected depending on the clone; the number of polypeptide changes showed a good correlation with the degree of morphological transformation. At the nonpermissive temperature the polypeptide patterns of ts ASV-transformed cells were indistinguishable from that of the untransformed cells, which is in agreement with the morphological data.","Brzeski, H;Ege, T"
6253079,1980,Cell,"DNA of Epstein-Barr virus VIII: B95-8, the previous prototype, is an unusual deletion derivative.","B95-8, an infectious mononucleosis-derived isolate of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is biologically and antigenically indistinguishable from other isolates of EBV and has been the prototype for previous studies of EBV DNA. The long unique region UL of the DNA of a Burkitt tumor isolate, W91, is 9 X 10(6) daltons longer than the UL of B95-8. The ""additional DNA and the regions around it have been cloned from W91 and another Burkitt tumor isolate, AG876. The additional DNA is viral and not cellular, since W91 and AG876 have almost identical additional DNA, and there is no detectable homology to human lymphocyte DNA. The insertion site of the additional DNA is within the 0.96 X 10(6) dalton Hinf 1 fragment of B95-8 Bam Hl l. After infection and transformation of five cell lines B95-8 did not pick up additional DNA in this region. Hybridization of labeled DNAs from three EBV-infected cell lines derived from patients with infectious mononucleosis to blots of fragments of the additional DNA indicates that these sequences are present in American as well as in African virus. B95-8 is therefore an unusual deletion derivative. A newly discovered feature of EBV DNAs is that sequences which map near the left end of UL have homology to part of the additional DNA.","Raab-Traub, N;Dambaugh, T;Kieff, E"
6160916,1980,Cell,Defective terminal differentiation in culture as a consistent and selectable character of malignant human keratinocytes.,"Culture conditions can be manipulated to vary the rate at which keratinocytes (stratified squamous epithelial cells) become committed to differentiate terminally. When deprived of anchorage in semisolid medium, normal human keratinocytes irreversibly lose the ability to reinitiate growth in surface culture with a t1/2 of 3 hr and then proceed to form cornified envelopes. We examined six established lines from human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) for defects in this function. One SCC line which grew progressively in semi-solid medium could not be induced to form cornified envelopes. The other five lines, which grew abortively, at best, in semisolid medium, formed envelopes under this condition but at subnormal rates. During anchorage deprivation the SCC lines became committed to differentiate much more slowly than normal, with t1/2's of 24--144 hr. SCC cells therefore possess at least a partial defect in the triggering of terminal differentiation. In vivo, such an alteration may permit malignant behavior by evading an important tissue-specific mechanism for limiting growth. In culture, the phenotype of increased survival in semi-solid medium may be used to detect and select malignantly transformed keratinocytes.","Rheinwald, J G;Beckett, M A"
6254669,1980,Cell,Identification of a cellular protein substrate phosphorylated by the avian sarcoma virus-transforming gene product.,"The avian sarcoma virus-transforming gene product (pp60src) appears potentially able to mediate cell transformation via phosphorylation since it is tightly associated with a protein kinase activity. We have searched for and have been able to identify a normal cellular protein that appears to be a substrate of pp60src. The phosphorylation of this protein (34K) in transformation-specific in ASV-transformed cells of both avian and mammalian origin. Moreover, the 34K polypeptide serves as a substrate for the pp60src phosphotransferase activity in vitro and is phosphorylated at a site identical to the major site of phosphorylation in vivo. These data suggest that upon transformation the 34,000-dalton protein is phosphorylated directly as a result of pp60src activity.","Erikson, E;Erikson, R L"
6159984,1980,Cell,Transformation by Rous sarcoma virus: a cellular substrate for transformation-specific protein phosphorylation contains phosphotyrosine.,"Transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is caused by a single viral gene, src, which encodes a phosphoprotein, pp60src, with the enzymatic activity of a protein kinase. The relative abundance of a 36,000 molecular weight (36K) phosphorylated polypeptide which can be detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis of 32P-labeled phosphoproteins is greatly increased in RSV-transformed fibroblasts. We have reported previously that phosphorylation of the 36K polypeptide is an early event in the process of transformation and that protein synthesis is not required for its appearance. Here we identify a nonphosphorylated 36K polypeptide, present in both uninfected and transformed cells, which is homologous to the 36K phosphoprotein as judged by limited proteolysis and by tryptic peptide mapping. We conclude that the 36K phosphoprotein is generated by phosphorylation of this 36K polypeptide. It has recently been shown that pp60src phosphorylates tyrosine residues in vitro: phosphotyrosine and also phosphoserine are present in the 36K phosphoprotein isolated from RSV-transformed cells. On the basis of these results we propose that the 36K polypeptide present in chicken fibroblasts is a substrate for the protein kinase activity of pp60src. Phosphorylation of this polypeptide may be important in cellular transformation by Rous sarcoma virus.","Radke, K;Gilmore, T;Martin, G S"
6773666,1980,Cell,"Activity of multiple light chain genes in murine myeloma cells producing a single, functional light chain.","Two cloned lambda 1-producing myelomas (HOPC-1, MOPC-104E) contain rearranged kappa genes and levels of mature-sized kappa RNA comparable to those found in kappa-producing myeloma cells. Another lambda 1-producing myeloma tumor line (HOPC-2020) and a lambda 1-containing B cell leukemia line (BCL1) also contain significant levels of kappa RNA. One lambda 11-producing line (MOPC-315) contains no detectable kappa RNA, but it also has no kappa genes in the embryonic configuration. kappa-related proteins are not detectable in the lambda 1-producing lines by standard procedures, but by sensitive methods at least two lines contain kappa protein fragments. The MOPC-104E line produces both a 14.5K kappa fragment that is not readily detectable because of its low rate of synthesis and short half-life (T 1/2 less than 5 min), and a major 16.5K protein that lacks kappa cross reactivity but is demonstrable by translation of purified MOPC-104E kappa RNA. The HOPC-1 kappa RNA also encodes a short-lived 14K kappa fragment. The MPC-11 line, which produces a mature kappa RNA and protein as well as an 800 base kappa fragment RNA and kappa protein fragment, has both kappa alleles rearranged, one apparently aberrantly between J and C kappa. Two different kappa RNA species, one the same size as the MPC-11 kappa fragment RNA, frequently are present in kappa RNA-containing Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed lymphoid cells as well as in 18 and 19 day murine fetal liver. For light chains, neither allelic nor isotype exclusion is generally evident in myeloma and lymphoma cells; rather both produce only a single functional light chain. Models of light chain activation must explain restriction by considering the functional properties of the light chain rather than light chain gene expression.","Alt, F W;Enea, V;Bothwell, A L;Baltimore, D"
6251973,1980,Cell,Structure and gene organization in the transformed Hind III-G fragment of Ad12.,"The nucleotide sequence of the transforming Hind III-G fragment of Ad12 DNA which encompasses the left 6.8% of the genome has been determined. The fragment was 2320 nucleotides long, and contained a GC cluster at positions 126-155 and a region extremely rich in AT at positions 1098-1142 (number from the leftmost end). Possible coding regions for the two transforming gene products were assigned. The predicted coding region for T antigen g is positions 502-1069 and positions 1144-1373, which are joined by splicing (266 amino acid residues, 30 kd), and that for T antigen f is positions 1845-2126 (94 amino acid residues, 10 kd). The sequence of the Hind III-G fragment was compared with that of the transforming DNA fragment of Ad5 which encompasses the left 8.0% of the genome (2809 nucleotides). There are several discrete regions with significant sequence homology. The comparison suggests that the regions in the left two thirds of the Ad5 and Ad12 transforming DNA fragments (map units 0-4.7% in Ad5 and 0-4.4% in Ad12) bear some resemblance in their gene organizations, and code for proteins containing structurally homologous regions.","Sugisaki, H;Sugimoto, K;Takanami, M;Shiroki, K;Saito, I;Shimojo, H;Sawada, Y;Uemizu, Y;Uesugi, S;Fujinaga, K"
6156006,1980,Cell,Binding of merocyanine 540 to normal and leukemic erythroid cells.,"Normal erythroid cells and both uninduced and induced erythroleukemia cells were stained with the leukemia-specific fluorescent probe merocyanine 540 and its analogs. The external membranes of normal intact cells bound the dye, but this general low-affinity binding was completely abolished by the addition of competing serum. In contrast, erythroleukemia cells bound the dye even in the presence of serum; binding was not affected by reversing the sign of the charge carried by MC540, but was abolished upon removal of certain hydrophobic side chains. When the erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate, the distribution of dye-binding regions was altered by the cell such that staining became localized to one region of the membrane. Concomitantly, conconavalin A binding sites were redistributed and became localized in the same region of the membrane as the merocyanine binding sites. Merocyanine 540 is thus shown to bind to a hematopoietic surface feature whose topological distribution is subject to cellular control during differentiation. This leukemia-specific marker may be one of several eliminated during enucleation of mammalian erythroid cells.","Schlegel, R A;Phelps, B M;Waggoner, A;Terada, L;Williamson, P"

Treatment of bone marrow cells with this antibody and complement results in greater than loss 95% loss of the A-MuLV-derived in vitro transformed foci. The surface antigen detected by this antibody is also expressed on A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cell lines, thymocytes, and some peripheral lymphocytes. This antigen is not expressed, however, by the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell defined by the spleen colony-forming assay.

6247068,1980,Cell,Localization of the src gene product of the Harvey strain of MSV to plasma membrane of transformed cells by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry.,"Using electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, we have investigated the intracellular location of the src protein (p21) in cells transformed by the Harvey strain of Murine Sarcoma Virus (Ha-MSV). Antibodies to p21 were derived from tumor-bearing rats inoculated with Ha-NRK cells. The distribution of p21 in intracellular sites in MDCK dog cells transformed by Ha-MSV was examined and quantified using a recently developed immunocytochemical technique. More than 95% of p21 was localized to the inner surface of the plasma membrane in these Ha-MSV-transformed cells; p21 was not exposed on the outside surface of the plasma membrane. A similar location was observed by immunofluorescence in other Ha-MSV-transformed cell lines, including cells derived from rat, mouse and mink. This finding, and the previous demonstration that p60src of avian sarcoma virus is concentrated on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, suggests that the plasma membrane is a major site of action for transforming proteins.","Willingham, M C;Pastan, I;Shih, T Y;Scolnick, E M"
6767548,1980,Cell,Different lymphoid cell targets by transformation by replication-competent Moloney and Rauscher mouse leukemia viruses.,"Mouse leukemia viruses (MuLV) have been reported to induce tumors involving cells within the T lymphocyte lineage. In the present study, striking differences were demonstrated in the target cells for in vivo transformation by two clonal replication-competent type C viruses, Moloney- and Rauscher-MuLV. Moloney-MuLV-induced tumors and lymphoma cell lines exhibited Thy.1 antigen in the absence of detectable Fc or C3 receptors, indicating their T cell origin. Rauscher-MuLV primary tumors and lymphoma cell lines of the same mouse strain, however, invariably exhibited Fc receptors in the absence of Thy.1 antigen, suggesting that these tumors were of the B lymphoid lineage. The pattern of immunoglobulin synthesis by individual Rauscher-MuLV tumor cell lines was determined by both biosynthetic and radioimmunologic techniques. Rauscher-MuLV lymphoma lines invariably expressed immunoglobulin heavy (mu) chain in the absence of detectable light (kappa or lambda) chains. These findings establish that the target of neoplastic transformation in response to Rauscher-MuLV is an immature cell within the B lymphoid lineage. The demonstration of different target cells for transformation by well characterized clonal strains of mouse leukemia virus should aid in elucidating the mechanisms by which these viruses induce malignancy.","Reddy, E P;Dunn, C Y;Aaronson, S A"
6244894,1980,Cell,Methylation of milk-borne and genetically transmitted mouse mammary tumor virus proviral DNA.,"The 5-methylcytosine content of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-specific DNA sequences acquired by both milk-borne infection and genetic transmission was determined for both normal and neoplastic tissues of the mouse. Using the restriction endonuclease Msp I, which cleaves at the recognition sequence 5'-CCGG, and its isoschizomer Hpa II, which is inhibited by methylation of the cytosine base of the CpG dinucleotide, it can be demonstrated that MMTV proviruses acquired via germ line infection are extensively methylated at both the site for Msp I-Hpa II cleavage and the site for Hha I (5'-GCGC), which is also inhibited by base modification of the cytosine. The virus-specific sequences acquired via milk-borne infection, however, are not modified at these sites in DNA from either normal infected or transformed tissues. Finally, cellular sequences are nonspecifically hypomethylated in a phenomenon unique to transformed tissue and apparently unrelated to the specific hypomethylation of exogenously acquired MMTV proviruses.","Cohen, J C"
6244110,1980,Cell,Maternally transmitted resistance to lymphoma development in mice of reciprocal crosses of the RF/J and AKR/J strains.,"Females but not males of the low-lymphoma RF/J strain transmit a non-Mendelian factor which suppresses the development of lymphoma in F1 crosses with mice of the high-lymphoma AKR/J strain. Suppression of lymphoma was also evident in the first backcross generation to the parental AKR strain, but only when (RF female x AKR male)F1 mice had been the female parent. This ""maternal resistance factor"" was transmitted independently of the dominant, lymphoma-suppressing Fv-1n allele transmitted by both males and females of the RF strain, but the suppressive capacities of the two factors appeared to be additive. In this cross, F1 progeny of RF females also showed marked suppression of ecotropic murine leukemia virus expression by comparison with mice of the reciprocal F1 cross, but this suppression of virus expression was not detected in the lymphoma-suppressed AKR backcross population. The observation of lymphoma suppression in the absence of ectropic virus suppression in mice of the (RF X AKR)F1 female x AKR male backross generation indicates a qualitative or quantitative difference in the determination of these two effects.","Mayer, A;Struuck, F D;Duran-Reynals, M L;Lilly, F"
6244102,1980,Cell,Phenotypic alteration in retroviral gene expression by leukemia-resistant thymocytes differentiating in leukemia-susceptible recipients.,"(AKR x NZB)F1 mice possess the dominant genes, Akv-1, Akv-2, Nzv-1a and Nzv-2a, which determine the expression of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. Nevertheless, their thymic lymphocytes fail to produce these agents, and these mice are resistant to leukemia. We investigated the mechanism of this cell-specific restriction in radiation chimeras. (AKR x NZB)F1 thymocytes that had differentiated in lethally irradiated AKR recipients produced high levels of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses and showed marked amplification of MuLV antigen expression. Polytropic viruses could also be isolated from such thymocytes. These virological changes in chimeric thymocytes were donor- and host-specific and occurred only when (AKR x NZB)F1 bone marrow cells were inoculated into AKR recipients. This inductive capacity of the host environment could be detected in irradiated AKR recipients as early as age 2 months. The phenotypic changes brought about in leukemia-resistant (AKR x NZB)F1 thymocytes by the leukemia-susceptible AKR thymic microenvironment may be the result of a three-component inductive system.","Datta, S K;Waksal, S D;Schwartz, R S"
519762,1979,Cell,Nonrandom chromosome changes involving the Ig gene-carrying chromosomes 12 and 6 in pristane-induced mouse plasmacytomas.,"The karyotypes of pristane-induced mouse plasmacytomas were studied by G banding. Only primary tumors or early passage generations were analyzed. In contrast to murine T cell leukemias that showed a regular trisomy of chromosome 15, all plasmacytomas showed a consistent translocation of the distal part of chromosome 15 to either chromosome 6 [rcpT(6;15)] or 12 [T(12;15)]. The specific breakpoints were at 6C, 15D3/E ro D2/3 and 12F2. Early passage generations often showed a mixed population with two different translocations, suggesting polyclonal origin. Considered together with the known karyotypic features of murine and human lymphomas, these findings support the theory that the nonrandom chromosomal changes in lymphoproliferative malignancies are associated with the type of the target cell, rather than with the etiological agent. Moreover, the involvement of the chromosomes known to carry the heavy chain (12) and the light chain (6) determinants, respectively, raises the question of whether the translocations may be related to the DNA level rearrangements known to occur during the differentiation of normal plasma cells.","Ohno, S;Babonits, M;Wiener, F;Spira, J;Klein, G;Potter, M"
519755,1979,Cell,Tumor antigens of human Ad5 in transformed cells and in cells infected with transformation-defective host-range mutants.,"We have studied the polypeptides associated with the expression of the transforming region of the Ad5 genome by immunoprecipitating antigens (using the double antibody and protein A-Sepharose techniques) from cells infected with wild-type (wt) Ad5 or transformation-defective host range (hr) mutants and from cells transformed by Ad5. Three different antisera were used: P antiserum specific for early viral products (Russell et al., 1967) and two different hamster tumor antisera. Immunoprecipitation of antigens from wt-infected KB cells followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of precipitated proteins revealed that a major polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 58,000 was detected with all three antisera and with both the double antibody and the protein A-Sepharose techniques, while P antiserum also precipitated polypeptides of molecular weights 72,000, 67,000 and 44,000, which probably represent the DNA binding protein and related polypeptides, respectively. With the double antibody technique, in addition to the proteins mentioned above, P antiserum and the hamster tumor antisera precipitated a 10,500 dalton polypeptide which was not detected when the protein A-Sepharose procedure was used. Using either the double antibody or the protein A-Sepharose technique, we found that hr mutants from complementation group II failed to induce the synthesis of the 58,000 dalton protein, whereas mutants from complementation group I produced normal or near normal amounts. Using the double antibody technique, we found that the 10,500 dalton protein was absent or made in reduced amounts by group I mutants. A 58,000 dalton protein was detected in a number of different Ad5-transformed cell lines, including the 293 human line, the 14b hamster line and several transformed rat cell lines. This observation and the fact that transformation negative group II mutants fail to induce the synthesis of a 58,000 dalton polypeptide suggest that this protein is one of the Ad5-specific products necessary for cell transformation.","Lassam, N J;Bayley, S T;Graham, F L"
316362,1979,Cell,Tumor promoters and epidermal growth factor stimulate anchorage-independent growth of adenovirus-tranformed rat embryo cells.,"Previous studies indicated that the potent tumor promoter 12--0--tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhances transformation of rat embryo cells (2 degrees RE) by a mutant of human Ad5 (H5ts125). This study examines the effect of TPA, its structural analogs and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on anchorage-independent growth of a cloned population of H5ts125-transformed 2 degrees RE cells (clone E11). Both TPA and EGF (approximately 10(-8) M) induced a 3--5 fold increase in agar cloning efficiency of E11 cells. In addition, macroscopic colonies appeared earlier and were larger and more diffuse. The TPA analogs phorbol--12,13--didecanoate (PDD) and ingenol--3,20--dibenzoate also enhanced growth in agar of E11 cells, whereas phorbol, 4 alpha PDD and 4--0--meTPA, which are inactive as tumor promoters, failed to enhance agar growth. In contrast to the results obtained with E11 cells, TPA, PDD or ingenol--3,20--bidenzoate failed to induce growth in agar of normal 2 degrees RE cells. Dexamethasone (10(-5)--10(-6) M), trans retinoic acid (10(-5)--10(-6) M) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, antipain and elastatinol did not inhibit the ability of TPA to enhance the growth of E11 cells in agar. The TPA-enhanced anchorage independence was a stable property, since subclones of E11 cells isolated from TPA-agar plates had a higher agar cloning efficiency than the parental E11 cells when retested in the absence of TPA. This effect of TPA does not appear to reflect simple selection of a subpopulation of cells. When the parental E11 cells were first cloned in monolayer culture in the absence of TPA, all ten randomly picked clones showed enhanced growth in agar in the presence of TPA. In addition, prior growth of E11 cells in monolayer culture in the presence of TPA did not enhance their subsequent growth in agar. This system therefore provides an example in which TPA appears to enhance the acquisition of a stable cell property, and thus may be a useful model for studying mechanisms of tumor promotion and progression.","Fisher, P B;Bozzone, J H;Weinstein, I B"
229967,1979,Cell,Differences between the endogenous and exogenous DNA sequences of Rous-associated virus-O.,"DNA sequences related to the endogenous retrovirus of chickens, Rous-associated virus-O (RAV-O), have been examined using site-specific DNA endonuclease analysis of cellular DNA derived from line 15 and line 100 chickens. Individual embryos from both inbred lines were used as a source of embryonic fibroblasts from which cellular DNA was isolated. Analysis of DNA containing either endogenous RAV-O sequences alone or both endogenous and exogenous RAV-O sequences produced identical patterns of RAV-O-specific DNA fragments after digestion with the endonucleases Eco RI, Hind III, BgI II, Bam HI or Xho I. Similar analysis with endonucleases Hinc II or Hha I, however, produced several RAV-O-specific DNA fragments which were derived from cellular DNA containing both endogenous and exogenous RAV-O sequences but not from cellular DNA containing only endogenous sequences. Although some differences exist between the DNA fragments specific for the endogenous viral sequences of line 15 and line 100 cellular DNA, the DNA fragments specific for the exogenous viral sequences were identical between the two inbred lines. Cleavage of an unintegrated linear RAV-O DNA molecule with Hinc II or Hha I produced DNA fragments identical to those specific for the exogenously acquired RAV-O provirus. This suggests that these characteristic fragments contain no cellular DNA. The potential DNA junction fragments containing both viral and cellular DNA, identified after analysis of DNA that contains both endogenous and exogenous viral sequences, were identical to those observed after analysis of DNA containing only endogenous viral sequences. These results support the following conclusions. First, exogenous proviral sequences are integrated into chicken cell DNA following an interaction between viral and cellular DNA that is specific with respect to the virus and nonspecific with respect to the cell. Second, both the free linear RAV-O DNA intermediate and the newly integrated exogenous provirus contain specific endonuclease sites that are not found in endogenous RAV-O DNA sequences. These results suggest that the formation of the exogenous DNA provirus involves specific alteration of the endogenous viral DNA sequences before reinsertion of the sequences as the exogenous RAV-O DNA provirus. It is possible that newly integrated exogenous RAV-O sequences are characterized by specific differences in the pattern of base methylation and a limited sequence arrangement.","Humphries, E H;Glover, C;Weiss, R A;Arrand, J R"
229962,1979,Cell,Plus and minus strand leader RNAs in negative strand virus-infected cells.,"Sendai virus and VSV minus strand genome RNAs, labeled specifically at their 3' ends with RNA ligase, were used as probes to detect leader RNA--that is, short transcripts (approximately 50 nucleotides) complementary to the exact 3' end of the minus strand genome. These probes have allowed the detection of plus strand leader RNAs in both Sendai virus and VSV-infected cells as well as in the virion transcriptase reactions. The use of a similar probe, prepared from the self-complementary ends of DI genome RNA and containing the 3' end of the plus strand antigenome RNA, has allowed the detection of a minus strand leader RNA of identical size in VSV-infected cells. Since the presence of DI genomes could not be detected by analytical sucrose gradient centrifugation in these VSV-infected cells, this minus strand leader RNA is apparently synthesized on the template formed by the exact 3' end of the antigenome RNA.","Leppert, M;Rittenhouse, L;Perrault, J;Summers, D F;Kolakofsky, D"

Putative phosphorylations were detected by charge alterations in proteins labeled with 35S--methionine and, in some cases, confirmed by labeling with 32P--phosphate. We assessed the relative stabilities of proteins affected by cAMP, the periods of susceptibility of proteins to cAMP-dependent modification and any cAMP-mediated changes in protein synthesis or stability. Five proteins (of about 650 resolved) behave as expected for ""orthodox"" substrates of a cAMP-activated protein kinase: both newly synthesized and prelabeled forms of these proteins are subject to modification; this modification involves an acidic charge shift of about one unit; and cAMP-mediated conversion of these proteins to their modified forms is virtually complete. The acidic forms of at least three of these proteins also exhibit cAMP-mediated increases in 32P--phosphate incorporation. Each protein comprised less than approximately 0.005% of cellular protein. Under basal conditions they appear to be phosphorylated to an extent about 20--30% of that found in fully stimulated cells. Nine proteins show cAMP-dependent changes in rates of synthesis with six inductions and three repressions. Most of these changes are of a magnitude of about 3 to 5 fold, and reach their maximal extents after about 4--5 hr of exposure to dibutyryl cAMP. In addition to the phosphorylations, inductions and repressions mentioned above, approximately 12 other reproducible cAMP-dependent changes in protein patterns are observed. Mutant cell lines deficient in catalytic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase show none of the changes in protein pattern attributable to cAMP.","Steinberg, R A;Coffino, P"
227607,1979,Cell,Chicken hematopoietic cells transformed by seven strains of defective avian leukemia viruses display three distinct phenotypes of differentiation.,"Chicken hematopoietic cells transformed in vitro and in vivo by seven strains of replication-defective avian leukemia viruses were assayed for the expression of six erythroid and five myeloid differentiation parameters, including differentiation-specific surface antigens as detected by newly developed antisera. The transformed cells were found to display three distinct phenotypes of differentiation. First, cells transformed by AEV resemble erythroblasts. They express heme, globin, carbonic anhydrase and erythrocyte cell surface antigen at low levels, and histone H5 and erythroblast cell surface antigen at high levels. Second, cells transformed by MC29, CMII, OK10 and MH2 viruses have macrophage-like properties. They strongly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen, but only weakly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and are negative for ATPase activity. Third, cells transformed by AMV and E26 viruses resemble myeloblasts in that they weakly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen but strongly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and ATPase activity. No difference was found between in vitro- and in vivo-transformed cells in the parameters tested. In light of recent genetic and biochemical evidence, we believe that these phenotypes reflect the action of three new types of viral-transforming genes, designated erb (erythroblast), mac (macrophage) and myb (myeloblast).","Beug, H;von Kirchbach, A;Döderlein, G;Conscience, J F;Graf, T"
227604,1979,Cell,Characterization of different tumor antigens present in cells transformed by simian virus 40.,"In addition to large T and small t antigens, cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40) commonly contain other proteins which specifically immunoprecipitate with SV40 anti-T serum and which are  not detected in untransformed cells. The additional tumor antigens (T-Ags) fall into two groups: those having a close structural relationship with normal SV40 T-Ags, and those unrelated to large T and small t. The latter are probably nonviral T-Ags (NVT-Ags). The NVT-Ags comprise a family of proteins of molecular weight 50,000-55,000. Fingerprint analysis shows that NVT-Ags have few if any peptides in common with large T or small t, and that they lack the amino terminal tryptic peptide and the peptides unique to small t. NVT-Ags from different species have different fingerprints, but those isolated from different transformants of the same cell line are identical. The size of NVT is unaltered in cells transformed by mutants of SV40 with deletions in the region 0.60-0.55 map units. The mRNA for NVT does not hybridize to SV40 DNA. The other forms of T-Ag isolated from transformed cells fall into three classes: shortened forms of large T (truncated large T); multiple species of T-Ag with molecular weights very similar to, but distinct from, those of normal large T (large T doublets and triplets); and elongated forms of large T (super T). These proteins all contain the normal amino terminus of SV40 T-Ags, and the truncated forms of large T lack peptides from the carboxy terminal half of large T. One species of super T (molecular weight 130,000) contains only those methionine tryptic peptides present in normal large T, although it may contain some peptides in more than one copy.","Smith, A E;Smith, R;Paucha, E"
509516,1979,Cell,The integration sites of endogenous and exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus.,"Specific cDNA probes of Moloney and AKR murine leukemia viruses have been prepared to characterize the proviral integration sites of these viruses in the genomes of Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice. The genetically transmitted Moloney provirus of Balb/Mo mice was detected in a characteristic Eco RI DNA fragment of 16 x 10(6) daltons. No fragment of this size was detected in tissue DNAs from Balb/c mice infected as newborns with Moloney virus. We conclude that a viral integration site, occupied in preimplantation mouse embryos, is not necessarily occupied when virus infects cells in post-natal animals. Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice do carry the AkR structural gene in an Eco RI DNA fragment of 12 x 10(6) daltons. Further restriction analysis of this fragment indicated that both mouse lines carry one AKR-type provirus. Leukemogenesis in Balb/Mo and newborn infected Balb/c mice is accompanied by reintegration of Moloney viral sequences in new chromosomal sites of tumor tissues. Part of the reintegrated Moloney viral sequences are of subgenomic size. The AKR viral sequences, however, are not found in new sites. Further restriction analysis revealed that the development of Moloney virus-induced leukemia in Balb/Mo mice does not lead to detectable structural alteration of the genetically transmitted Moloney and AKR structural genes. Possible mechanisms of the reintegration process are also discussed.","van der Putten, H;Terwindt, E;Berns, A;Jaenisch, R"
228858,1979,Cell,Localization of the ASV src gene product to the plasma membrane of transformed cells by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry.,"The cellular location of the src gene product (p60src) of the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of avian sarcoma virus has been determined by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in Schmidt-Ruppin ASV-transformed NRK cells, and the amount of the protein in different regions of the cell has been quantified. The protein is concentrated on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, particularly under ruffles, and it is highly concentrated on the inner surface of the membrane near junctions connecting adjacent cells. Small amounts of p60src were detected in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear Golgi region of the cell. No significant localization was detected in control NRK cells or in NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten strain of murine sarcoma virus. The presence of p60src on the inner surface of the plasma membrane indicates that the changes in cell growth, cell shape and cell membrane structure noted in ASV-transformed cells are due to an initial action of p60src at the cell membrane.","Willingham, M C;Jay, G;Pastan, I"
487430,1979,Cell,Isolation and transformation of primary mesenchymal cells of the chick embryo.,"Pure primary mesenchymal cells from definitive streak stage chick embryos have been prepared free of epiblast and hypoblast cells. These cells have the potential in culture to differentiate into erythroid cells, beating heart muscle tissue, chondrocytes and epithelial cells. Transformation in vitro of pure primary mesenchymal cells by avian erythroblastosis virus (wt-AEV) and a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts34-AEV) gave rise to rapidly growing cells which remained largely undifferentiated, could be cloned in semi-solid medium and could be maintained for up to 3 months in culture. The majority of mesenchymal cells transformed by wt-AEV (MAE cells) are benzidine-negative. Gel electrophoresis of radioactively labeled cell proteins, immunoprecipitated with specific antisera against chicken hemoglobin, showed that MAE cell clones synthesize the alpha D, pi (or pi') and some unidentified ""globin"" polypeptide chains. Treatment of MAE cell clones with 1.0 mM n-butyrate stops cell proliferation reversibly and causes an increased synthesis of alpha D and pi (or pi') globin polypeptide chains. In certain clones of mesenchymal cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of the virus, ts34-AEV (MAE-ts34 cells), benzidine-positive cells can be induced by a shift from 37 degrees to 41 degrees C. The ability of the clone to undergo an increase in benzidine-positivity by temperature shift is decreased with the age of the clone. Different clones show a variable proportion of cells which are positive by immunofluorescence for both globin and chicken-specific histone H5. The alpha A and alpha D globin chains are synthesized in MAE-ts34 clones, but the ratios and quantities of these chains vary for different clones. Temperature shift made little difference in the types and quantities of globin chains synthesized; the increase in benzidine positivity is probably due to an increase in heme biosynthesis.","Keane, R W;Lindblad, P C;Pierik, L T;Ingram, V M"
226268,1979,Cell,Defective interfering particles modulate VSV infection of dissociated neuron cultures.,"Infection of dissociated neuron cultures of mice with VSV and its defective particle DI-T was studied using fluorescent light microscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopy. When cultures are infected with wild virus, VSV replicates selectively in neurons, producing cell death within 24-48 hr. Sensory and immature neurons express viral antigen most rapidly. Viral antigen and viral budding sites are detected along the neuron soma and dendrites. When large amounts of DI-T particles are added to the wild virus inoculum, viral growth is completely suppressed in mature neurons, the cell killing effects of VSV are considerably delayed and co-infected cultures survive for 5-16 days. Viral antigen accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and on the membrane of neuron cell somas and dendrites in the virtual absence of viral assembly. Identical modulation of VSV infection in mature neuron cultures is obtained when DI-T particles are added before or after the wild virus, but ultraviolet inactivation of DIs completely abolishes their protective effect. Immature neurons or Vero cells cannot be protected from acute cytopathic changes by an equivalent amount of DI particles. Thus DIs interfere with replication and assembly of the wild virus and attenuate cell killing effects in mature neurons in vitro.","Faulkner, G;Dubois-Dalcq, M;Hooghe-Peters, E;McFarland, H F;Lazzarini, R A"
226265,1979,Cell,Cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of avian sarcoma virus cause tumors in vivo at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures.,"Chick embryo (CE) fibroblasts and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells transformed by temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of avian sarcoma virus (NY68, LA23, LA24, LA25, LA29, LA31, GI201, GI202, GI251, GI253 induce tumors on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick eggs at temperatures that correspond to the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures used to induce conditional expression of the ""transformed"" phenotype in these cells when cultured in vitro. Chick embryo cells infected with transformation-defective mutants of ASV (td101, td108) or RAV-50 were nontumorigenic under the same conditions, as were nontransformed CE and NRK cells. This indicates that the CAM is not an unusually susceptible substrate for cell growth and that the ability of tsASV-transformed cells to form tumors at nonpermissive temperatures reflects their true tumorigenicity. In contrast, a ts mutant chemically transformed rat liver cell line, ts-223, only formed tumors on the CAM under permissive conditions. The wild-type parent cells (W-8) of this mutant produced tumors at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Direct implantation of microprobe thermometers into tumors caused by ts-ASV-transformed cells at nonpermissive temperatures confirmed that tumor formation occurred in a stable temperature environment and was not due to temperature fluctuations which might have created semi-permissive conditions for tumor growth. Cells isolated from tumors formed at nonpermissive temperatures and recultured in vitro displayed temperature-dependent hexose transport and colony formation in agar similar to the orginal parent cell inoculum. Similarly, virus recovered from tumors at nonpermissive temperatures retained the ts mutation.","Poste, G;Flood, M K"

The mutants were selected as variants which lack the Xba I endonuclease cleavage site at 4 map units on the viral chromosome. The deletions range in size from 150-2300 bp and are located between 1.5 and 10.5 map units. The mutants can be propagated in 293 cells (Ad5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells), but are defective for growth in HeLa or human embryonic kidney cells. No viral DNA synthesis was observed in mutant virus-infected HeLa cells. All but one of the deletion mutants tested were defective for transformation of rat embryo and rat embryo brain cells.","Jones, N;Shenk, T"
476828,1979,Cell,Abnormal lipid-linked oligosaccharides in class E Thy-1-negative mutant lymphomas.,"The glycosylation defect of Thy-1-mutant lymphomas of the class E complementation group has been identified as a block in the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. Two major lipid-linked oligosaccharides were isolated from the mutant cells. Both oligosaccharides were smaller than the lipid-linkid oligosaccharides of wild-type lymphomas and, in contrast to the lipid-linked oligosaccharides isolated from wild-type cells, both were resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H. The oligosaccharides of newly synthesized polypeptides in class E Thy-1-cells were also resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, providing strong evidence that they are derived from the abnormal lipid-linked oligosaccharides.","Trowbridge, I S;Hyman, R"
476826,1979,Cell,Teratocarcinoma stem cells have a cell surface carbohydrate-binding component implicated in cell-cell adhesion.,"Teratocarcinoma stem cells maintained in the undifferentiated state express a carbohydrate-binding component that recognizes oligomannosyl residues. This cell surface molecule is detected by a rosetta assay in which the stem cells form rosettes with glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. Addition of simple sugars to the assay mixture has little effect, but rosette formation is inhibited by a series of mannose-rich glycoproteins (yeast invertase, yeast mannans and horseradish peroxidase). Periodate oxidation eliminates the inhibitory activity of invertase whereas pronase digestion has little effect, indicating that carbohydrate moieties are essential for inhibition. Invertase and its glycopeptide derivatives also inhibit the reaggregation of dispersed stem cells and promote the dissociation of preformed aggregates. These results suggest that intercellular adhesion of teratocarcinoma stem cels may be the consequence of the interaction of a lectin-like component detected in the rosette assay with a complementary oligosaccharide receptor on adjacent cells.","Grabel, L B;Rosen, S D;Martin, G R"
289444,1979,Cell,Memory of MEL cells to a previous exposure to inducer.,"The mechanism of commitment of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells to terminal differentiation has been examined. Before a significant proportion of cells becomes committed, a lag period of at least 9 hr of exposure to inducer is observed. Cells withdrawn from inducer can reinitiate commitment without a lag when reexposed. The proportion of committed cells in a culture discontinuously exposed to inducer is identical to that in a continuously exposed culture even if withdrawal from inducer lasts for 18 hr. The ability to tolerate an interruption in the exposure has been termed ""memory."" The memory of a previous exposure to inducer is complete up to 18 hr. It is partially erased after 36 hr and completely erased after 72 hr. The length of time the memory persists is not affected by the length of the initial exposure to inducer. These results suggest that a cellular component necessary for the commitment event accumulates in response to inducer and that this component has a decay time on the order of 10 hr.","Levenson, R;Housman, D"
225038,1979,Cell,Loss of integrated viral DNA sequences in polyomatransformed cells is associated with an active viral A function.,"Rat cells transformed by polyoma virus contain, in addition to integrated viral DNA, a small number of nonintegrated viral DNA molecules. The free viral DNA originates from the integrated form through a spontaneous induction of viral DNA replication in a minority of the cell population. Its presence is under the control of the viral A locus. To determine whether the induction of free viral DNA replication was accompanied by a loss of integrated viral DNA molecules in a phenomenon similar to the ""curing"" of lysogenic bacteria, we selected for revertants arising in the transformed rat populations and determined whether these cells had lost integrated viral genomes. We further investigated whether the viral A function was necessary for ""curing"" by determining the frequency of cured cells in populations of rat cells transformed by the ts-a mutant of polyoma virus following propagation at the permissive or nonpermissive temperature. A large proportion of the revertants isolated were negative or weakly positive when assayed by immunofluorescence for polyoma T antigen and were unable to produce infectious virus upon fusion with permissive mouse cells. The T antigen-negative, virus rescue-negative clones can be retransformed by superinfection and appear to have lost a considerable proportion of integrated viral DNA sequences. Restriction enzyme analysis of the integrated viral DNA sequences shows that the parental transformed lines contain tandem repeats of integrated viral molecules, and that this tandem arrangement is generally lost in the cured derivatives. While cells transformed by wild-type virus undergo ""curing"" with about the same frequency at 33 degrees or 39 degrees C, cells transformed by the ts-a mutant contain a much higher frequency of cured cells after propagation at 33 degrees than at 39 degrees C. Our results indicate that in polyoma-transformed rat cells, loss of integrated viral DNA can occur at a rather high rate, producing (at least in some cases) cells which have reverted partially or completely to a normal phenotype. Loss of integrated viral DNA is never total and appears to involve an excision event. The polyoma A function (large T antigen) is necessary for such excision to occur. In the absence of a functional A gene product, the association of the viral DNA with the host DNA appears to be very stable.","Basilico, C;Gattoni, S;Zouzias, D;Valle, G D"
225037,1979,Cell,The roles of the simian virus 40 tumor antigens in transformation of Chinese hamster lung cells.,"Simian virus 40 mutants and deletions between 0.54 and 0.59 map units direct the synthesis of defective 20K t antigens (Crawford et al., 1978). These deletion mutants transformed actively growing CHL cells nearly as efficently as did wild-type virus, in either the focus formation assay or the growth in soft agar assay. In contrast, when CHL cells were in a resting state during infection, the transformation frequency of the mutants relative to wild-type dropped approximately 50 fold. The presence of the phorbol ester, TPA, diminished this difference. CHL cell lines transformed by the deletion mutants and selected by the focus assay grew almost as efficiently in soft agar as lines transformed by wild-type SV40. Both produced tumors in nude mice. The function of the 20K t antigen is discussed.","Martin, R G;Setlow, V P;Edwards, C A;Vembu, D"
556552,1979,Cell,An MSV-specific subgenomic mRNA in MSV-transformed G8-124 cells.,"An intracellular subgenomic RNA species from MSV-transformed G8-124 cells was characterized by electron microscopy of RNA:cDNA heteroduplexes using long cDNAs both MSV and MuLV. This subgenomic RNA, 3.1 kb long, consisted of 5'-derived sequences of about 0.4 kb joined to 2.7 kb of RNA derived from the 3' end of the RNA genome. The 3'-derived sequences included the residual sequences from the MuLV pol region and the acquired cellular sequences of MSV. The genome of MSV was shown to retain approximately 0.13 kb from the 5' end of the MuLV env region, including sequences which span the point in the MuLV env mRNA. No subgenomic MSV RNA could be detected, however, which consisted of a 5'-derived leader sequence spliced to the retained env region sequences. Nor could a subgenomic MSV RNA be detected in which a 5'-derived leader sequence was joined directly to the acquired cellular sequences. Although its translation products are unknown, the subgenomic MSV RNA was present in preparations of poly(A)+ polysomal RNA, consistent with this RNA functioning as a messenger. The structure of this 3.1 kb MSV subgenomic RNA suggests a possible role in the expression of 3'-encoded MSV information, possibly including transformation-specific sequences.","Donoghue, D J;Sharp, P A;Weinberg, R A"
222476,1979,Cell,AKR leukemogenesis: identification and biological significance of thymic lymphoma receptors for AKR retroviruses.,"We have previously demonstrated that in vitro cell lines of mouse thymic lymphomas express surface receptors specific for the retrovirus that induced them. This study extends these observations to an analysis of receptor-bearing cells in the preleukemic and leukemic phases of spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomagenesis. AKR mice regularly begin expressing N-tropic retroviruses (as assayed on NIH fibroblasts by the XC plaque assay) in several tissues early in life; thymic lymphocytes also express these viruses, but are not autonomously transformed. Later thymic lymphomas emerge which are capable of metastasizing in the host of origin or transplanting leukemias into syngeneic hosts. Just prior to the appearance of thymic lymphomas, these mice also begin producing xenotropic retroviruses [as assayed in xenogeneic (For example, mink) fibroblasts], and concomitant with the appearance of the leukemias is the appearance of ""recombinant"" retroviruses which cause mink fibroblast foci (MCF); these viruses express elements of both N- and X-tropic virus envelopes and N-tropic viral gene products in their cores. Spontaneous AKR leukemias also produce other retroviruses which do not cause XC plaques or mink fibroblast foci; these are called SL viruses. The subject of this study was to test whether in vivo thymocytes in the preleukemic and leukemic periods also bear receptors specific for N-tropic, recombinant MCF and SL AKR retroviruses. We demonstrated that each spontaneous thymic lymphoma does bear receptors that bind viruses produced by the lymphomas and MCF-247 to a high degree and that bind N-ecotropic AKR retroviruses less well. Thymic lymphocytes predominating in the preleukemic period do not express detectable levels of receptors for either of the viruses. In some mice, receptor-positive cells co-exist with receptor-negative cells; only the receptor-positive cells are capable of transplanting leukemia to syngeneic hosts. We conclude that the presence of specific cell surface receptors for lymphoma cell-produced and recombinant AKR retroviruses is a marker for leukemia in these hosts.","McGrath, M S;Weissman, I L"
222475,1979,Cell,Characterization of a 54K dalton cellular SV40 tumor antigen present in SV40-transformed cells and uninfected embryonal carcinoma cells.,"SV40 infection or transformation of murine cells stimulated the production of a 54K dalton protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated, along with SV40 large T and small t antigens, with sera from mice or hamsters bearing SV40-induced tumors. The same SV40 anti-T sera immunoprecipitated a 54K dalton protein from two different, uninfected murine embryonal carcinoma cell lines. These 54K proteins from SV40-transformed mouse cells and the uninfected embryonal carcinomas cells had identical partial peptide maps which were completely different from the partial peptide map of SV40 large T antigen. An Ad2+ND4-transformed hamster cell line also expressed a 54K protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera. The partial peptide maps of the mouse and hamster 54K protein were different, showing the host cell species specificity of these proteins. The 54K hamster protein was also unrelated to the Ad2+ND4 SV40 T antigen. Analogous proteins immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera, ranging in molecular weight from 44K to 60K, were detected in human and monkey SV40-infected or -transformed cells. A wide variety of sera from hamsters and mice bearing SV40-induced tumors immunoprecipitated the 54K protein of SV40-transformed cells and murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Antibody produced by somatic cell hybrids between a B cell and a myeloma cell (hybridoma) against SV40 large T antigen also immunoprecipitated the 54K protein in virus-infected and -transformed cells, but did not do so in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines. We conclude that SV40 infection or transformation of mouse cells stimulates the synthesis or enhances the stability of a 54K protein. This protein appears to be associated with SV40 T antigen in SV40-infected and -transformed cells, and is co-immunoprecipitated by hybridomas sera to SV40 large T antigen. The 54K protein either shares antigenic determinants with SV40 T antigen or is itself immunogenic when in association with SV40 large T antigen. The protein varies with host cell species, and analogous proteins were observed in hamster,  monkey and human cells. The role of this protein in transformation is unclear at present.","Linzer, D I;Levine, A J"
222474,1979,Cell,Phorbol ester-induced morphological changes in transformed chick fibroblasts: evidence for direct catalytic involvement of plasminogen activator.,"The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces the production of the serine protease plasminogen activator (PA) in cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and synergistically enhances PA production in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts (RSVCEF). Following PMA treatment of serum-free RSVCEF cultures, PA induction is accompanied by distinct morphological changes, including enhanced cell clustering and the formation of dense cellular aggregates. These alterations in the morphology of the PMA-treated transformed cells are inhibited by several protease inhibitors, including leupeptin, NPGB, SBTI, benzamidine and DFP, the specific inhibitor of serine enzymes. A number of protease inhibitors are ineffective in preventing the PMA-induced morphological changes; these include inhibitors of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin and, most importantly, plasmin. The use of a fluorescent substrate to assay PA directly demonstrated that the pattern of inhibiton of PA activity correlates exactly with the inhibition of morphological changes. The of 3H-DFP to label and characterize serine zymes in the culture fluid from PMA-treated cells further indicated that PA is the serine protease responsible for the morphological changes. Thus PA itself can catalytically alter cellular behavior in culture independent of plasminogen, until not its only known natural substrate.","Quigley, J P"
222473,1979,Cell,Spontaneous glycosylation of glycosaminoglycan substrates by adherent fibroblasts.,"SV40-transformed mouse fibroblasts migrate upon, and spontaneously glycosylate, plastic substrates derivatized with chondroitin-6 sulfate and hyaluronic acid. Autoradiography of cultures prelabeled with 3H-glucose and 3H-galactose demonstrates the presence of silver grains near adherent cells. Silver grains are particularly dense near cells cultured on chondroitin sulfate. No significant grains are observed on control dishes or dishes derivatized with polygalacturonic acid. Radioactive material left by cells is not removed by boiling the dishes in 8 M urea and 10% sodium dodecylsulfate, suggesting that it is covalently linked to the derivatized plastic. Acid hydrolysis shows that the radioactive material consists of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine when the prelabeled cells are cultured on hyaluronic acid. When cells are cultured on chondroitin sulfate, the radioactive product consists only of glucuronic and and N-acetylgalactosamine sulfate. Sonicates of prelabeled cells or the supernatants from cultures of intact prelabeled cells add no SDS-urea-resistant radioactivity to dishes derivatized with these glycosaminoglycans.","Turley, E A;Roth, S"
455456,1979,Cell,"Mammary plasminogen activator: correlation with involution, hormonal modulation and comparison between normal and neoplastic tissue.","We have analyzed the plasminogen activator (PA) content of normal rodent mammary glands at different stages of the mammary life cycle and after exposing the animals to various hormones; we have also assessed the PA response of mammary explants to a variety of hormonal environments. Similar studies were performed on a limited number of primary mammary tumors. Plasminogen activator production was clearly correlated with mammary involution. A large but transient increase in enzyme content followed the initiation of involution in all glands, and the enzyme was produced by mammary cells, not by macrophages or granulocytes. Oxytocin, prolactin and hydrocortisone, which slowed or blocked involution, produced parallel effects on gland regression and PA synthesis. PA synthesis by explants in organ culture was induced by hormonal environments that fostered involution and repressed by those that promoted lactation. Mammary tumors produced much more PA than normal tissue both in vivo and in vitro, and distinct differences were found in the response of enzyme synthesis to hormones. The results reinforce the association of PA with tissue remodeling; show that the enzyme can be used as an indicator of cellular response to a wide range of hormones in both normal and malignant tissue; and suggest that observations of this type in organ culture may be of some value in predicting physiological responses in vivo.","Ossowski, L;Biegel, D;Reich, E"
222472,1979,Cell,Cross-linking of fibronectin to sulfated proteoglycans at the cell surface.,"Fibronectin is a major surface protein of normal animal cells but is absent from many transformed cells. Addition of fibronectin to transformed cells causes increased cell substrate adhesion and changes in the morphology and cytoskeleton of the cells. We have coupled fibronectin to photoactivable chemical cross-linkers and have added it to cells to identify those molecules to which it binds. In this way, fibronectin can be cross-linked to sulfated proteoglycans at the cell surface. The cross-linking is specific for fibronectin. The fibronectin-proteoglycan complex is sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and AC and to trypsin. Addition of fibronectin also affects binding of hyaluronic acid to the cells. These results suggest that fibronectin interacts with proteoglycans at the cell surface. The existence of such interactions may have implications for the role of fibronectin and proteoglycans in cell adhesion.","Perkins, M E;Ji, T H;Hynes, R O"
222471,1979,Cell,Karyologically identified homozygous tw18 embryos: extrauterine growth properties and transformation by SV40.,"A method for identifying individual embryos from crosses segregating homozygous t lethals using the marker chromosome Rb7 is described and applied to the tw18 haplotype. In contrast to wild-type and heterozygous littermates, homozygous tw18/tw18 6 and 8 day embryos have very limited growth potentialities in vitro. When transplanted under the testis capsule, homozygous tw18 embryos (3, 6 and 7 day) produce teratomas at a much lower efficiency than heterozygous and wild-type embryos, and the rare teratomas thus obtained have limited growth potentialities when cultured in vitro. Upon transformation with SV40, however, permanent lines of cells of mesodermal origin, capable of myoblastic or adipocytic differentiation, have been obtained. This shows that the effect of the mutation on cell growth can be overcome by SV40 transformation.","Kelly, F;Guenet, J L;Condamine, H"
222469,1979,Cell,Cellular regulation of mammalian sarcoma virus expression: a gene regulation model for oncogenesis.,"Investigations aimed at defining cellular functions required for expression of transformation by mammalian sarcoma viruses have led to the isolation of a class of revertants that contain biologically active feline sarcoma virus, yet possess in vitro and in vivo properties of normal cells. The block to expression of the transformed state in these cellular revertants was spontaneously reversible at low frequency. Moreover, infection with certain helper viruses reversed the block at very high efficiency. Helper virus complementation was shown not to be a direct effect of helper virus functions expressed in the initially infected revertant cell. Rather, the helper virus acted indirectly by rescuing sarcoma virus and allowing it to infect and transform another cell within the revertant population. Using biochemical and immunologic techniques, it was possible to demonstrate a specific and very marked reduction in transcriptional and translational products of the sarcoma viral genome in the revertant cells. Findings that the reversal of this block was associated with reacquisition of the transformed phenotype, together with other evidence, suggest that reversion results from cellular transcriptional regulation of the integrated sarcoma virus genome. Reversion in this virus transformation system provides a model for oncogenesis resulting from derepression of cellular genes that possess malignant potential.","Porzig, K J;Robbins, K C;Aaronson, S A"
88265,1979,Cell,Transformed mammalian cells secrete specific proteins and phosphoproteins.,"We have examined the proteins secreted into the growth medium by normal and transformed cells. Transformed cell lines from several mammalian species all secrete proteins in the 58,000 dalton molecular weight range. These proteins are all immunologically related and are secreted at low levels or not at all by the parental normal cell lines. Secretion of the 58K proteins occurs with either DNA or RNA virus transformation and with spontaneous transformation. The transformed cells also secrete phosphoproteins in the same size range, but these are immunologically distinct from the 58K proteins mentioned above. The sizes of the phosphoproteins are species-specific and unrelated to the transforming virus. Incubation of conditioned media from transformed cell cultures with gamma-32P-ATP labels phosphoproteins of the same sizes, indicating the presence in the media of both protein kinase and substrate. All three properties (58K protein, phosphoprotein, in vitro phosphorylation) are closely correlated with transformation in cells transformed by temperature-sensitive viruses. The biological implications of these results remain unknown, but the results may be relevant to recent data on the (phospho)proteins and protein kinase encoded by RNA tumor viruses and the molecular basis of the transformed phenotype.","Senger, D R;Wirth, D F;Hynes, R O"
222466,1979,Cell,The fibronexus: a transmembrane association of fibronectin-containing fibers and bundles of 5 nm microfilaments in hamster and human fibroblasts.,"A possible connection between external fibronectin-containing fibers and cytoplasmic 5 nm actin microfilaments within dense submembranous plaques has been observed by transmission electron microscopy. We refer to this transmembranous association as the fibronexus. Hamster embryo fibroblasts, transformed by wild-type or temperature-sensitive mutant (A28) SV40 virus, and human lung fibroblasts (WI-38, MRC-5) were studied using the tannic acid method of Simionescu and Simionescu (1976), which preferentially stained external carbohydrates. Fibronectin antigens were also localized on the extracellular fibers of the fibronexus with fibronectin antibody and immunoferritin staining. Goniometric studies of sections cut parallel to the plasmalemma demonstrated that the actin- and fibronectin-containing fibers of the fibronexus remained colinear when the specimen was tilted through a 40 degree angle about the fibrillar long axis. Sections cut perpendicular to the cell surface also showed that these fibers were apparently colinear. Our results suggest that the fibronectin and actin fibers of the fibronexus are closely associated (maximum separation distances of 8--22 nm), if not co-axial. Fibronexuses remained after expression of SV40-induced transformation, despite alteration of microfilament bundles and reduction in the amount of fibronectin (observed by immunofluorescence microscopy). The possible roles of fibronectin and the fibronexus in regulating actin polymerization are discussed.","Singer, I I"
222465,1979,Cell,Response of hemopoietic cells to avian acute leukemia viruses: effects on the differentiation of the target cells.,"Chicken bone marrow cells were infected with three avian acute leukemia viruses (ALV)--avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), myelocytomatosis virus strain MC29 and Mill Hill 2 virus (MH2)--and then cultured in agar in the presence of conditioned medium. Under these conditions, it was found that very few cells served as target cells for these three viruses. Density gradient separation showed that ALV target cells were found primarily in the light density fractions and might be represented by cells committed to the mononuclear phagocyte pathway. Separation of bone marrow cells on the basis of their sedimentation velocity at unit gravity suggested that MC29 and AMV did not share the same target cells. In addition, the analysis of surface receptors and functional markers characteristic of macrophages (Fc and complement receptors, phagocytosis and immune phagocytosis) indicated that the ALV-transformed cells were blocked during their differentiation. These results indicate that the transforming ability of ALV interferes with the differentiation of their target cells.","Gazzolo, L;Moscovici, C;Moscovici, M G;Samarut, J"
287566,1979,Cell,Deficient heme synthesis as the cause of noninducibility of hemoglobin synthesis in a Friend erythroleukemia cell line.,"Friend cells of the line Fw are not induced to accumulate substantial amounts of hemoglobin and to become benzidine-positive when treated with butyric acid or other inducers, except in the presence of exogenous hemin. The cells are shown to have a deficiency in heme synthesis since they require exogenous hemin during the period of maximal hemoglobin synthesis; since endogenous heme synthesis cannot be induced to the level found in normal inducible Friend cells, even after hemoglobin synthesis has been induced by hemin and butyric acid and the hemin has then been withdrawn; since they are not inducible for ferrochelatase (heme synthetase) activity; and since they accumulate free globin chains after stimulation with butyric acid in the absence of hemlin. Comparison of globin synthesis and globin mRNA content of the cells shows that globin synthesis is not controlled by the hemin-controlled repressor of protein synthesis (HCR) nor by any specific translational control of globin synthesis by hemlin.","Rutherford, T R;Weatherall, D J"
222460,1979,Cell,Immunoglobulin synthesis by lymphoid cells transformed in vitro by Abelson murine leukemia virus.,"The majority of cell lines derived by infection of murine bone marrow cells with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) synthesize a mu chain but no detectable light chain. Aside from this mu-only phenotype, lines that make only light chain, both chains or no immunoglobulin-related polypeptides have also been found. Two lines have been studied in detail: one that makes only mu chain and one that makes only kappa light chain. Synthesis of both polypeptides can be increased by modifying the culture conditions so as to decrease the growth rate of the cells. Although some kappa chain secretion was observed, neither secreted nor surface mu was detected. We suggest that the mu- only phenotype may be an early normal step in the pathway of B lymphocyte maturation.","Siden, E J;Baltimore, D;Clark, D;Rosenberg, N E"
222456,1979,Cell,Integration of the DNA of mouse mammary tumor virus in virus-infected normal and neoplastic tissue of the mouse.,"We have used restriction endonucleases which cleave the DNA of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) at one site (Eco RI) and several sites (Pst I, Sac I and Bam HI) to study infection and mammary tumorigenesis in mice. Proviruses acquired during infection of BALB/c mice foster-nursed by virus-producing C3H females can be distinguished from the MMTV proviruses endogenous to uninfected BALB/c mice by the nature of the fragments generated with Pst I and Bam HI. Using this assay, we show that lactating mammary glands as well as mammary tumors from BALB/cfC3H mice have acquired MMTV DNA, and that a minimum of approximately 10% of normal glandular cells can be infected. The new proviruses appear to be linked to cellular DNA of mammary tumors and infected lactating mammary glands within a limited region (0.2 x 10(6) daltons) of the viral DNA; the location of this region, based upon mapping studies with unintegrated MMTV DNA, suggests that the orientation of these proviruses is colinear with linear DNA synthesized in infected cells and thus approximately colinear with the viral RNA. Comparisons of many mammary tumors and studies of lactating mammary glands with a high proportion of independently infected cells indicate that a large number of sites in the cellular genome can accommodate a new provirus; the acquired proviruses are rarely, if ever, found in tandem with each other or with endogenous proviruses. We cannot, however, distinguish between random integration and integration into a large number of preferred sites in the host genome. Since Eco RI and Bam HI cleavage of DNA from each mammary tumor generates a unique set of viral-specific fragments, we propose that the tumors are composed principally of cells derived from a subset of the many infected cells in a mammary gland; this proposal is supported by our finding that Eco RI digestion of DNA from several transplants of a primary tumor yields the pattern characteristic of the primary tumor.","Cohen, J C;Shank, P R;Morris, V L;Cardiff, R;Varmus, H E"
222454,1979,Cell,The cytoskeletal framework and poliovirus metabolism.,"The cytoskeletal framework prepared by detergent lysis of suspension-grown HeLa cells is compared to the structure obtained from poliovirus-infected cells. This framework, which retains major features of cell morphology and carries the cellular polyribosomes as well as the major structural filaments, is profoundly reorganized following virus infection. This reorganization underlies, at least in part, the morphological changes termed the ""cytoplasmic effect."" These cytoskeletal changes appear related to the involvement of the framework with viral-specific metabolism. Extensive cytoskeleton alterations occur even when guanidine inhibits viral replication, and thus result from small amounts of early viral products. The normally spheroidal nucleus deforms, allowing a modified region of the cytoplasm to occupy a central position in the cell, and many membrane-enclosed vesicles peculiar to the infected cell are elaborated here. The skeleton preparation reveals that this region contains intermediate filaments arranged in a pattern unique to infected cells. Further changes occur when viral replication is permitted. The central region filaments become coated with darkly staining material which may be viral RNA. Numerous small particles appear on the filaments which resemble partially assembled virions. Mature virions, however, have no affinity for the cytoskeleton and appear to be free in the cytoplasm. Host cell messenger RNA, normally attached to the skeletal framework, is released in infected cells and is replaced by the viral-specific polyribosomes. The trabecular network which carries polyribosomes appears to be rearranged; the viral polyribosomes are located principally at the cell periphery and are excluded from the central region. The viral replication complex with its double-stranded RNA is also attached to the skeletal framework and may comprise the dark staining material coating the filaments of the central cell region.","Lenk, R;Penman, S"
88263,1979,Cell,Properties of a basement membrane-related glycoprotein synthesized in culture by a mouse embryonal carcinoma-derived cell line.,"Two glycoproteins, GP-1 and GP-2, have been isolated from an extracellular membrane synthesized in cell culture by an embryonal carcinoma-derived cell line. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions have been determined. Both proteins are rich in half-cystine residues and contain approximately 12-15% carbohydrate. Antibodies have been obtained against one of the glycoproteins, GP-2, in rabbits. The antibody reacts with basement membranes from adult mouse and human kidney glomeruli and tubules, and all basement membranes tested from mouse embryonic tissues. The molecular properties of GP-2 are superficially similar to LETS protein; however, immunological and other criteria show that they are distinct proteins. The presence of LETS protein and GP-2 in basement membranes suggests that there are subtle interactions which are important in adhesion of epithelial cells to basement membranes.","Chung, A E;Jaffe, R;Freeman, I L;Vergnes, J P;Braginski, J E;Carlin, B"
570461,1979,Cell,Detailed neurite morphologies of sister neurolbastoma cells are related.,"Neuroblastoma cells exhibit a wide variety of patterns of neurite morphology. However, when these cells are induced to extend neurites under conditions in which mitotic sister cells are readily identifiable, 60% of these sister pairs display analogous morphologies. These cells are related either as identical twins or as mirror images of each other. The relatedness is expressed in considerable detail of neurite morphology. These relationshiops can persist through at least two cell divisions. The results suggest that animal cells can inherit specific determinants of shape.","Solomon, F"
217542,1979,Cell,Immunofluorescence on avian sarcoma virus-transformed cells: localization of the src gene product.,"The localization of the avian sarcoma virus src gene product (termed p60src) was examined by indirect immunofluorescence in cells transformed by the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus, subgroup D (SR-RSV-D). Antiserum to p60src was obtained from rabbits bearing SR-RSV-D-induced tumors, and immunofluorescence was performed on chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed with SR-RSV-D, as well as normal rat kidney (NRK) cells transformed by the same virus (termed SR-RK cells). Both acetone and formaldehyde fixation were used for the immunofluorescence tests. The specificity of the anti-tumor serum was first demonstrated in both cell systems by gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates prepared from 35S--methionine-labeled cells. Anti-tumor serum precipitated p60src from SR-RSV-D-transformed CEF but not from CEF infected with a transformation-defective mutant of SR-RSV-D. All viral structural proteins and precursors contained in these immunoprecipitates could be eliminated by competition with unlabeled virus. Similar experiments on SR-RK cells indicated that no viral proteins other than p60src were expressed in these cells, and this observation was supported by immunofluorescence tests using antiserum to whole virus. For immunofluorescence localization of p60src, reactions with viral structural proteins were blocked with unlabeled virus. This presaturation step, obligatory for p60src detection in the SR-RSV-D-transformed CEF, was unnecessary when antitumor serum was tested on SR-RK cells, since p60src was the only viral protein detectable in these cells. With acetone-fixed cells, p60src-specific immunofluorescence revealed a characteristic fluorescence pattern which was similar in both cell systems. The principal pattern was diffuse and situated in the cytoplasm. A clear nuclear fluorescence was never observed. Immunofluorescence on formaldehyde-fixed cells also indicated the cytoplasmic location of p60src and revealed a specific subcytoplasmic concentration of the fluorescence. With both fixation methods, an additional fluorescence pattern was seen between cells in contact, and was also found in both SR-RK cells and SR-RSV-D-transformed CEF. Immunofluorescence on viable cells suggested that p60src was not on the surface of these transformed cells. The fluorescence patterns were specific for avian sarcoma virus-transformed cells and were not found in uninfected cells, cells infected with a transformation-defective mutant of SR-RSV-D or cells transformed by an antigenically unrelated murine sarcoma virus. Furthermore, anti-tumor serum did not contain antibodies to proteins of the microtubules or intermediate filaments.","Rohrschneider, L R"
84715,1979,Cell,A defined subgenomic fragment of in vitro synthesized Moloney sarcoma virus DNA can induce cell transformation upon transfection.,"The longest DNA molecules synthesized by endogenous reverse transcription in detergent-permeabilized Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) virions (clone G8-124) are double-stranded DNA molecules of 5,8 kilobase pairs (kbp). This DNA species has been purified by sedimentation of total in vitro synthesized Mo-MSV DNA through neutral sucrose gradients. A physical map of the positions of the cleavage sites for a series of restriction endonucleases has been derived for this 5.8 kbp DNA. Mo-MSV DNA synthesized in vitro was found to induce morphological transformation of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts upon transfection. The foci had a morphology indistinguishable from that of Mo-MSV-induced foci, and the induced transformed phenotype was stable. The 5.8 kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) purified by agarose gel electrophoresis also induced focal transformation. Furthermore, gel-purified, restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of 5.8 kbp dsDNA containing the region from 2.8--4.9 kbp on the physical map of Mo-MSV DNA were able to induce foci. In contrast, endonuclease-generated DNA fragments lacking this region on the map were unable to transform cells upon transfection. When transformants derived by transfection with 5.8 kbp dsDNA were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) helper virus, Mo-MSV was rescued from a small portion of these cells, suggesting the establishment of the complete viral genome in these cells. One Mo-MSV DNA fragment, spanning 2.8--4.9 kbp on the physical map, was generated by cleavage of 5.8 kbp DNA with endonucleases Hind III + Sal I and currently represents our maximum estimate for the size of the transforming region of the Mo-MSV genome. This fragment includes the Mo-MSV sequences which are found in the DNA of uninfected mouse cells.","Andersson, P;Goldfarb, M P;Weinberg, R A"
728999,1978,Cell,Lack of correlation between the decreased expression of cell surface LETS protein and tumorigenicity in human cell hybrids.,"An analysis of the correlation between tumorigenicity and the loss of expression of the large external transformation-sensitive glycoprotein (LETS) was performed on human cell hybrids and their respective normal and tumorigenic parental cell lines. The distribution of cell surface LETS protein in a series of cell lines was examined by both specific immunofluorescent staining and by gel electrophoresis of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed, iodinated cell surface proteins. The tumorigenicity of these cell lines was assayed in nude mice. Although the series of cell lines studied provided a broad spectrum of LETS protein expression, both quantitatively and qualitatively, there does not appear to be a correlation between tumorigenicity and decreased expression of the LETS protein. In a series of transformed, nontumorigenic hybrids, the LETS protein expression was found to be altered with respect to both decreased organizational complexity and decreased content. These hybrids continue to express a number of other transformed phenotypes. Conversely, a number of tumorigenic hybrids continue to express relatively high levels of LETS protein when compared with nontumorigenic hybrids. Thus an alteration in LETS protein expression by itself, or in concert with a spectrum of other transformation properties, does not appear to be a sufficient requirement for tumorigenicity and lends further support to an apparent separate control of the transformed versus tumorigenic phenotype.","Der, C J;Stanbridge, E J"
282012,1978,Cell,Activation of teratocarcinoma-derived hemoglobin genes in teratocarcinoma-Friend cell hybrids.,"Hybrid cells formed by the fusion of murine teratocarcinoma and Friend erythroleukemia cells synthesize hemoglobin in the presence of chemical inducers such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). By making use of the fact that the parental teratocarcinoma and Friend cells carried different alleles at the locus coding for the alpha chain of hemoglobin, it was possible to demonstrate that the teratocarcinoma-derived genes for the globin alpha chains are genetically active in hemoglobin-synthesizing hybrid cells. In addition, evidence is presented suggesting that the teratocarcinoma-derived genes for the beta-globin chains may also be expressed in the hybrids. Apparently the teratocarcinoma-derived genome has become reprogrammed to express erythroid functions following fusion of the teratocarcinoma cell to the Friend cell.","McBurney, M W;Featherstone, M S;Kaplan, H"
215325,1978,Cell,"Proviruses of avian sarcoma virus are terminally redundant, co-extensive with unintegrated linear DNA and integrated at many sites.","We have analyzed the DNA from 15 clones of avian sarcoma virus (ASV)-transformed rat cells with restriction endonucleases and molecular hybridization techniques to determine the location and structure of proviral DNA. All twenty units of proviral DNA identified in these 15 clones appear to be inserted at different sites in host DNA. In each of the ten cases that could be sufficiently well mapped, entirely different regions of cellular DNA were involved. Thus ASV DNA can be accommodated at many positions in cellular DNA, but the existence of preferred sites has not been excluded. Six of the 15 clones carry only one normal provirus, two contain two normal proviruses, and seven harbor either one or two proviruses that appear anomalous in physical mapping tests. Both ends of at least 18 proviruses, however, were found to contain sequences specific to both the 3' and 5' termini of viral RNA. The organization of these terminally redundant sequences appeared identical to that of the 300 base pair (bp) repeats found at the ends of unintegrated linear DNA (Shank et al., 1978). Proviral DNA is therefore co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with unintegrated linear DNA and has a structure we denote as CELL DNA-3'5'----------3'5'-CELL DNA. Three of the four anomalous proviruses which were fully analyzed were deletion mutants lacking 25--65% of the genetic content of ASV; the fourth provirus had a novel site for cleavage by Eco RI but was otherwise normal. Tests for the biological competence of proviral DNA, based upon rescue of transforming virus after fusion with chicken cells, were generally consistent with the physical mapping studies.","Hughes, S H;Shank, P R;Spector, D H;Kung, H J;Bishop, J M;Varmus, H E;Vogt, P K;Breitman, M L"
215323,1978,Cell,Kinase-negative mutants of S49 mouse lymphoma cells carry a trans-dominant mutation affecting expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.,"Kinase-negative mutants of S49 mouse lymphoma cells are pleiotropically negative for all known cAMP-mediated responses of S49 cells and yield cell extracts which are deficient in cAMP binding activity and devoid of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. In hybrids between kinase-negative and wild-type cells, the mutant phenotype is dominant: the tetraploid hybrids have reduced cAMP-binding activity and undetectable cAMP-dependent kinase activity. The mutant phenotype is attributable to neither a soluble inhibitor of kinase catalytic subunit, nor a defective kinase regulatory subunit acting as an inhibitor, nor a defective catalytic subunit which sequesters regulatory subunits in inactive complexes. We propose that these mutants carry trans-dominant lesions in a regulatory locus responsible for setting intracellular levels of kinase expression.","Steinberg, R A;van Daalen Wetters, T;Coffino, P"
215322,1978,Cell,"Plasminogen activator in chick embryo muscle cells: induction of enzyme by RSV, PMA and retinoic acid.","To explore the generality of the effects of sarcoma viruses, tumor-promoting phorbol esters and retinoic acid, we have studied plasminogen activator production in differentiating chick myogenic cultures. Although slightly higher than in chick fibroblast cultures, the level of spontaneously synthesized enzyme is low; it reaches a peak shortly after maximum cell fusion has been completed and then declines. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) transformation of differentiating myotubes was accomplished by infecting myoblasts with a temperature-sensitive mutant, maintaining cultures at the nonpermissive temperature until completion of fusion and shifting to permissive temperatures at selected times thereafter. RSV transformation, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and retinoic acid all induced high levels of plasminogen activator production by differentiating myotubes in the absence of DNA synthesis. In comparison with fibroblasts, virus-induced enzyme synthesis by myogenic cultures proceeded more slowly but ultimately reached comparably high levels. Whereas cAMP strongly repressed RSV- and PMA-induced plasminogen activator production by chick fibroblasts, it weakly stimulated enzyme synthesis by myotubes. This suggests that enzyme induction by RSV and PMA is not mediated primarily through effects on cAMP metabolism.","Miskin, R;Easton, T G;Reich, E"
215321,1978,Cell,Metabolism of acetylcholine receptor in chick embryo muscle cells: effects of RSV and PMA.,"We have investigated some aspects of the metabolism of the integral membrane protein acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in normal and transformed cultures of chick embryo muscle cells. Turnover of AChR in control muscle cell cultures was compared with turnover in cultures infected and transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and with cultures treated with the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The parameters of AChR metabolism were estimated using 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin as a stoichiometric high affinity ligand for the AChR. We found that both RSV transformation and PMA increased the rate of degradation and decreased the rate of synthesis of AChR. The consequent reduction in steady state receptor levels suggests that oncogenic transformation and tumor promoter significantly alter the metabolism of cell surface membranes. We also observed that parameters of AChR metabolism in control cultures changed systematically in a pattern which depended upon the age of the culture as well as the use of embryo extract or fetal bovine serum as medium supplements. The muscle cell system allows quantitative measurement of an integral membrane protein and its metabolism, and may serve as a more general model for alterations in membrane and surface receptor metabolism associated with the transformed state.","Miskin, R;Easton, T G;Maelicke, A;Reich, E"
215318,1978,Cell,Transformation of hamster embryo fibroblasts by a specific fragment of the herpes simplex virus genome.,"Isolated restriction endonuclease fragments of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome were introduced into hamster embryo cells to identify DNA sequences capable to transforming the cells with respect to acquisition of properties correlated with tumorigenicity. One of the fragments generated by cleavage of HSV-1 DNA with the restriction endonuclease Xba I was found to induce transformation at a frequency of about 10 colonies per quantity of fragment recovered from 1 microgram of uncut DNA; fractions containing the other Xba I fragments failed to induce transformation reproducibly, although occasional colonies were detected. The fragment with transforming activity (Xba I-F) is 15.5 X 10(6) daltons in molecular weight and is located between 0.30 and 0.45 map units on the HSV-1 genome. The Xba I-F transformants obtained were selected for their ability to replicate in low concentrations of serum; in addition, they were found to attain high saturation densities in the presence of 10% serum and to form colonies in semisolid medium. Moreover, the transformed cells produced at least one of the viral gene products (a membrane glycoprotein) encoded in the fragment used for transformation, indicating not only that viral DNA was incorporated into the cells, but also that viral genes were expressed.","Camacho, A;Spear, G"
83197,1978,Cell,Co-regulation of type C RNA virus production and cell differentiation in myeloid leukemic cells.,"Mouse myeloid leukemic cells which differ in their competence to be induced to differentiate by the normal macrophage- and granulocyte-inducing protein MGI have been used to study the relationship between type C RNA virus production and myeloid cell differentiation. Clones which can be induced by MGI to form Fc and C3 rosettes, to synthesize and secrete lysozyme and to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes (MGI+D+) were induced by MGI to produce higher amounts of type C virus. Clones (MGI+D-) that were less inducible by MGI for Fc and C3 rosettes and lysozyme and were not induced to from mature cells were also less inducible higher virus production. In both types of clones, the increased virus production induced by MGI preceded the induction of rosettes and lysozyme. Clones that were not induced by MGI for rosettes or lysozyme (MGI-D-) showed little or no enhancement of virus production. MGI did not affect virus production in erythroleukemic cells, and erythropoietin did not affect virus production in the myeloid leukemic cells. Dexamethasone, lipopolysaccharide, dimethylsulfoxide and low concentrations of actinomycin D can induce some differentiation-associated properties in some of the clones. With these compounds, there was also a direct relationship between the enhancement of virus production and induction of differentiation-associated properties. Virus released from the three types of clones before or after treatment with MGI or dexamethasone was identified as N-tropic. The enhancement of virus production, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity, was accompanied by an increase in the amount of the viral protein p30, and interferon, which idd not inhibit the induction of differentiation in the myeloid leukemic cells, also did not prevent the increase in the amount of p30. After the early enhancement of virus production associated with the induction of differentiation, a shut-off of virus production occurred in the mature cells induced by MGI in MGI+D+ clones, whereas clones that did not differentiate to mature cells continued to produce virus. The results indicate that enhancement of virus production appears to be an early step in the induction of differentiation. Once induction has occurred, the lack of virus production in the mature cells suggest that a subsequent shut-off of virus production may be required for the completion of differentiation to mature cells. This relationship between cell differentiation and virus production suggests that type C virus has a regulatory role in myeloid cell differentiation.","Liebermann, D;Sachs, L"
31979,1978,Cell,Phenotypic exclusion in mouse melanoma-rat hepatoma hybrid cells: pigment and albumin production are not reexpressed simultaneously.,"Hybridization of cells of defined and different histotypes has been carried out to investigate whether the expression (or reexpression) of parental functions is mutually exclusive, as is expected if the generally assumed rule of discreteness of differentiation applies to hybrid cells. A cross of pigmented mouse melanoma cells and albumin-producing rat hepatoma cells gave rise to hybrids containing essentially one set of chromosomes from each parent and producing neither melanin nor albumin. Cells of one hybrid clone are shown to retain the potential to reexpress both parental differentiations. Successive subclonings of this hybrid have shown that cells which reexpress one function may retain the potential to reexpress the other, and that freshly isolated, morphologically homogeneous subclones may produce pigment or albumin, but not both; there successive and exclusive shifts of phenotype are documented, and in these cases, chromosome loss is very slight. The use of immunoadsorbed antisera has revealed that most (if not all) of the albumin produced by the hybrid cells is of the mouse type. We conclude that both parental determinations are retained by the hybrid cells, and that the parental differentiations are reexpressed only in a mutually exclusive fashion.","Fougère, C;Weiss, M C"
719754,1978,Cell,Analysis of RNA initiated in isolated mouse myeloma nuclei using purine nucleoside 5'[gamma-S]triphosphates as affinity probes.,"The purine ribonucleoside triphosphate analogues adenosine 5'[gamma-S]triphosphate and guanosine 5'[gamma-T]triphosphate were used as affinity probes for studying RNA chain initiation in isolated nuclei from the mouse myeloma 66.2 cell line. Transcripts initiated with either nucleotide analogue were isolated by affinity chromatography on a mercury-agarose affinity column. The binding was specific and dependent upon the inclusion of the sulfur nucleotide analogues in the in vitro synthetic reaction. Several lines of evidence indicate that the affinity-labeled RNA is initiated in vitro. First, the sulfur nucleotide is recovered in high yield as a single nucleoside 5'[gamma-S]triphosphate 2',3'-monophosphate product following alkaline hydrolysis of RNA bound to the affinity column. Second, authentic ribosomal 5S RNA is known to initiate with GTP; in vitro 5S RNA is bound to mercury-agarose only if [gamma-S]GTP is used as the affinity label in the synthesis, and not if [gamma-S]ATP is used. Under the conditions studied, nuclei incorporated 1.2--2.4 pmole of UMP per 10(6) nuclei per min, and the rate of synthesis was unaffected by substitution of the nucleotide analogues for the normal nucleotides. The percentage of the total RNA synthesized that was incorporated into sequences initiated in vitro was 7.8 +/- 1.5% with [gamma-S]ATP and 9.6 +/- 6.4% with [gamma-S]GTP. The size of the total RNA synthesized, determined by sedimentation on sucrose density gradients containing dimethylsulfoxide, ranged from less than 5S to 45S, and the size of the affinity-labeled sequences ranged from less than 5S to 28S. Approximately half of the incorporation into RNA initiated in vitro was sensitive to a concentration of alpha-amanitin which selectively inhibits polymerase II activity. Most of the remaining incorporation into initiated sequences can be abolished by concentrations of alpha-amanitin that are inhibitory for polymerase III activity. Over 70% of the total incorporation into ribosomal 5S RNA transcripts was into sequences initiated in vitro. This initiation was catalyzed by polymerase III and was specific for GTP as the initiating nucleotide. The RNAase T1 fingerprint of the newly initiated 5S RNA indicates that this gene is accurately initiated and faithfully elongated in vitro. The use of these affinity label probes provides much greater sensitivity for studying the initiation of RNA in vitro.","Smith, M M;Reeve, A E;Huang, R C"
281261,1978,Cell,Control of globin gene expression by steroid hormones in differentiating Friend leukemia cells.,"Low levels of dexamethasone and related glucocorticoid hormones suppress the expression of globin genes during the DMSO-induced differentiation of Friend leukemia cells. In this response, the glucocorticoids appear to act at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in that 10(-8) M dexamethasone prevents the accumulation of both globin mRNA and globin protein, whereas 10(-9) M dexamethasone allows the accumulation of normal levels of hybridizable globin mRNA but prevents the accumulation of globin protein. This suppressive action of dexamethasone is more effective with DMSO as the inducer of globin gene expression than with hemin as the inducer. In contrast to the situation with glucocorticoids, certain sex steroids (etiocholanolone, testosterone and estradiol) facilitate the expression of globin genes in DMSO-treated Friend leukemia cells. The modulation of globin gene expression by steroid hormones is achieved in DMSO-treated cells without altering the growth and morphological changes which characteristically attend the differentiation of these cells.","Lo, S C;Aft, R;Ross, J;Mueller, G C"
214242,1978,Cell,Evidence that the transforming gene of avian sarcoma virus encodes a protein kinase associated with a phosphoprotein.,"Avian sarcoma virus (ASV) induces sarcomas in animals and transforms fibroblasts to a neoplastic state in cell culture. A single viral gene (src) is responsible for both the induction and maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Recent work has identified a protein with a molecular weight of 60,000 daltons that is apparently encoded in src and may be the effector molecule for the gene (Brugge and Erikson, 1977; Purchio et al, 1978). The putative product of src can be immunoprecipitated by antisera obtained from rabbits bearing tumors induced by ASV. We have used this approach to isolate the protein to characterize further its genetic origins and possible function. Our rabbit tumor antisera precipitated a protein with a molecular weight of 60,000 daltons; according to serological, biochemical and genetic criteria, this protein is encoded in src. We found that this protein is phosphorylated and therefore denoted it pp60. Phosphorylation of pp60 could be accomplished in vitro with extracts of ASV-infected cells. A temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src had no demonstrable effect on either the production or stability of pp60 in the infected cell, but phosphorylation of the protein was temperature-sensitive. Since the mutant src is not expressed at the restrictive temperature, our findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of pp60 is required for its function as the putative effector of src. Immunoprecipitates prepared with extracts of ASV-infected cells and the rabbit tumor antisera contained a protein kinase activity that catalyzed phosphorylation of the heavy chains of immunoglobulin molecules, using either ATP or GTP as phosphate donor. The kinase activity immunoprecipitated in parallel with pp60 was obtained only from cells that contained a functioning product of src and could not be precipitated with antisera directed against structural proteins of ASV. A temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src caused the kinase activity to be thermally inactivated in vitro far more rapidly than the activity from cells infected with wild-type virus. We conclude that both the protein kinase and pp60 are encoded in src, and that the enzymatic activity may be an intrinsic property of pp60. Phosphorylation of pp60 in cellular extracts was inhibited by calcium ion, whereas the immunoprecipitable kinase activity was not, suggesting that the kinase responsible for pp60 phosphorylation may be distinct from that encoded in src. Collett  and Erikson (1978) have also identified a protein kinase activity associated with pp60. These findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of specific cellular targets might account for transformation of the host cell by src.","Levinson, A D;Oppermann, H;Levintow, L;Varmus, H E;Bishop, J M"
214241,1978,Cell,Tumor antigens induced by nontransforming mutants of polyoma virus.,"We have studied the tumor (T) antigens induced by wild-type polyoma virus and several nontransforming mutants using immunoprecipitation with antisera from animals bearing polyomya-induced tumors followed by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a variety of mouse cells, wild-type virus induces a major T antigen species with apparent molecular weight of 100,000 daltons, and four minor T antigen species with apparent molecular weights of 63,000, 56,000, 36,000 and 22,000 daltons. Hr-t mutants, which have an absolute defect in transformation, induce a normal 100,000 dalton T antigen but are altered in the minor T antigen species. Hr-t deletion mutants induce none of the minor T antigen species seen in wild-type virus. In their place, these mutants induce T antigen species with molecular weights in the range of 6,000--9,000 daltons. The size of the very small T antigen products does not correlate in any simple way with the size or location of the deletions in the viral DNA. Point hr-t mutants induce two of the four minor T antigen species; they make apparently normal amounts of the 56,000 dalton product and reduced amounts of the 22,000 dalton product, but none of the 63,000 or 36,000 dalton species. Ts-a mutants, which have a temperature-sensitive defect in the ability to induce stable transformation, and which complement hr-t mutants, induce T antigens with the same mobility as wild-type; however, the 100,000 dalton T antigen of ts-a mutants is thermolabile compared to wild-type. A double mutant virus carrying both a ts-a mutation and a deletion hr-t mutation induces a thermolabile 100,000 dalton product and none of the minor T antigen species.

In this report, we test the hypothesis that the stability phenotype can be explained by virus genome integration into a recipient cell chromosome. The method of analysis is by means of somatic cell genetics. We have isolated a series of microcell hybrids between a TK- Chinese hamster cell line and a transformed mouse cell line expressing the TK encoded by HSV 1. Several of the hybrid lines contain a single murine chromosome and express only the viral TK. Karyotypic analysis of these hybrids and of TK- derivatives generated by BrdUrd counterselection reveals that the TK+ phenotype is correlated with the presence of the terminal portion of the long arm of a specific murine chromosome. Results of extensive isozyme analyses of the hybrids and their TK- segregants fully corroborate the karyologic data. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the viral tk gene is covalently integrated into this chromosomal region which itself does not appear to carry the endogenous murine tk locus. Other more complicated models are discussed. Our findings also show that somatic cell genetics can be used to localize viral integration sites in host chromosomes with high resolution.","Smiley, J R;Steege, D A;Juricek, D K;Summers, W P;Ruddle, F H"
214239,1978,Cell,Fv-1 regulation of lymphoma development and of thymic ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV expression in mice of the AKR/J x RF/J cross.,The incidence of spontaneous thymic lymphoma has been studied in crosses between AKR/J and RF/J mice. AKR mice develop a high incidence of this disease. RF mice transmit a marked resistance to development of the disease to F1 hybrid mice of the AKR x RF cross. This resistance is associated with a reduction of endogenous ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV expression in the prelymphomatous thymus. The RF gene governing the coordinate suppression of these three phenotypes has been mapped to the Fv-1 locus. These results indicate that the particular Fv-1 allele of AKR mice provides a permissive genetic background for endogenous ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV expression and that these viral activities may be etiologically involved in the development of spontaneous thymic lymphoma in the mouse.,"Mayer, A;Duran-Reynals, M L;Lilly, F"
214238,1978,Cell,The induction of differentiation in teratocarcinoma stem cells by retinoic acid.,"Embryonal carcinoma cells, the stem cells of teratocarcinomas, usually undergo extensive differentiation in vivo and in vitro to a wide variety of cell types. There exist, however, several embryonal carcinoma cell lines that have almost completely lost the capacity to differentiate, so that the cells are propagated primarily as the stem cells. Using one such cell line, F9, we have found that retinoic acid at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M induces multiple phenotypic changes in the cultures in vitro. These changes include morphological alteration at the resolution of the light microscope, elevated levels of plasminogen activator production, sensitivity to cyclic AMP compounds and increased synthesis of collagen-like proteins. The nature of these changes, as well as their independence of the continued presence of retinoic acid, are consistent with the proposition that retinoic acid induces differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells into endoderm.","Strickland, S;Mahdavi, V"
214237,1978,Cell,Plasminogen activator in chick fibroblasts: induction of synthesis by retinoic acid; synergism with viral transformation and phorbol ester.,"This paper reports the effect of vitamin A and its derivatives, the retinoids, on plasminogen activator (PA) synthesis in chick embryo fibroblast cultures (CEF). Low concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) (10(-6)-10(-10) M) and the retinoids stimulated PA synthesis in CEF; the maximal stimulation achieved, 9--10 fold, was somewhat lower than that obtained with optimal concentrations of the potent tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This action of RA required protein and mRNA synthesis but, in contrast to enzyme induction by PMA and/or sarcoma virus transformation, retinoid effects were not significantly inhibited by elevated concentrations of cAMP. In inducing and/or stimulating PA production, the effects of RA and sarcoma virus transformation were synergistic rather than additive. Analogous synergism was observed between RA and PMA, but only at suboptimal concentrations of the latter. RA did not affect PA production in normal or transformed cultures maximally stimulated by PMA. These findings may help to elucidate the role of retinoids in promoting tumor growth, tissue remodeling and teratogenesis.","Wilson, E L;Reich, E"
699048,1978,Cell,A possible mammary stem cell line.,"The cell line Rama 25 is derived from a mammary tumor induced in a rat by dimethylbenzanthracene. During rapid proliferation, Rama 25 cells appear as a single undifferentiated epithelial type; at high cell densities, however, small numbers of two other cell types are formed, which respectively resemble secretory and myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland, as judged by light and electron microscopy and immunofluorescent staining for casein (milk proteins). These additional cell types cannot be explained as contaminating cell populations since the cell line has been cloned several times; furthermore, the proportion of either can be increased by dimethylsulphoxide under different conditions. Specific epithelial features are seen by histological and ultrastructural examination of tumors formed by Rama 25 cells in immunodeficient mice. A line of the myoepithelial-like cells, Rama 29, isolated from a Rama 25 culture by cloning, is also described. We propose that the undifferentiated cell type is a form of mammary stem cell which can differentiate in culture.","Bennett, D C;Peachey, L A;Durbin, H;Rudland, P S"

One of these antibodies was found to react only with mouse embryonal carcinoma cells and no other tumor cell type tested, including differentiated derivatives of teratocarcinomas. In the adult mouse, this antigen is expressed by subpopulations of cells in the spleen, bone marrow, lymph node, brain, kidney and testes, although not in liver and thymus. This antigen has a species and tissue distribution consistent with that of Forssman antigen. The molecules which carry this specificity on the embryonal carcinoma cells appear to be glycolipids.","Stern, P L;Willison, K R;Lennox, E;Galfrè, G;Milstein, C;Secher, D;Ziegler, A"
210958,1978,Cell,Differential expression of Rous Sarcoma virus-specific transformation parameters in enucleated cells.,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed with the Ta and ts68 mutants of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) were enucleated and studied for their capacity to express reversibly the transformed phenotype in response to temperature changes. After shift to the permissive temperature (35 degrees C), the cytoplasts acquired a transformed morphology and displayed characteristic ruffles and microvilli at their surface. As detected by immunofluorescence, they also lost their actin filament cables and exhibited characteristic changes in the pattern of cell surface structures containing LETS protein. Expression of all these transformation parameters was reversible after shiftback to the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C). These results indicate that a whole set of changes characteristic for the transformed phenotype can be expressed independently of the cell nucleus. In contrast, ts mutant-infected cytoplasts were no longer able to respond to temperature shifts with changes in their hexose transport rate. Cytoplasts prepared from cells grown at 41 degrees C retained their low rate of hexose uptake after shift to 35 degrees C, whereas cytoplasts from cells grown at 35 degrees C exhibited a high rate of hexose transport even after 10 hr of shift to 41 degrees C. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the product of the src gene of RSV represents a multifunctional protein which acts independently on nuclear and extranuclear sites.","Beug, H;Claviez, M;Jockusch, B M;Graf, T"
688383,1978,Cell,Patterns of integration of viral DNA sequences in the genomes of adenovirus type 12-transformed hamster cells.,"The patterns of integration of the viral genome have been analyzed in four hamster cell lines transformed by adenovirus type 12 (Ad12). It has previously been shown that in each of the cell lines HA12/7, T637, A2497-2 and A2497-3, the viral genome persists in multiple copies, and that different parts of the viral DNA are represented non-stoichiometrically (Fanning and Doerfler, 1976). All four cell lines are oncogenic when injected into hamsters. The DNA from each of the cell lines was extracted and cleaved in different experiments with restriction endonucleases Bam HI, Bgl II, Eco RI, Hind III, Hpa II or Sma I. The DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose slab gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters by the Southern technique. Ad12 DNA sequences were detected by hybridization to Ad12 DNA, which was 32 P-labeled by nick translation, and by subsequent autoradiography. In some experiments, the 32P-labeled Eco RI restriction endonuclease fragments of Ad12 DNA were used to investigate the distribution of specific segments of the viral genome in the cellular DNA. For each cell line, a distinct and specific pattern of integrated viral DNA sequences is observed for each of the restriction endonucleases used. Moreover, viral sequences complementary to the isolated Eco RI restriction endonuclease fragments are also distributed in patterns specific for each cell line. There are striking differences in integration patterns among the four different lines; there are also similarities. Because the organization of cellular genes in virus-transformed as compared to normal cells has not yet been determined, conclusions about the existence or absence of specific integration sites for adenovirus DNA appear premature. Analysis of the integration patterns of Ad12 DNA in the four hamster lines investigated reveals that some of the viral DNA molecules are fragmented prior to or during integration. Analysis with specific restriction endonuclease fragments demonstrates that the Eco RI B, D and E fragments, comprising a contiguous segment from 0.17-0.62 fractional length units of the viral DNA, remain intact during integration in a portion of the viral DNA molecules. Although each cell line carries multiple copies of Ad12 DNA, the viral DNA sequences are concentrated in a small number of distinct size classes of fragments. This finding is compatible with, but does not prove, the notion that at least a portion of the viral DNA sequences, is integrated into repetitive sequences, or else that the integrated viral sequences have been amplified after integration. In the three cell lines which were tested, the integration pattern is stable over many generations, with continuous passage-twice weekly-of cells for 6-7 months. In the three cell lines which were examined, the integration pattern is identical in a number of randomly isolated clones. Hence it can be concluded that the patterns of integration are identical among all cells in a population of a given line of transformed cells.","Sutter, D;Westphal, M;Doerfler, W"
210955,1978,Cell,Cellular alterations dependent upon the polyoma virus Hr-t function: separation of mitogenic from transforming capacities.,"Hr-t mutants of polyoma virus are restricted in their growth properties (host range) and defective in cell transformation and tumor induction. The present study indicates that these mutants have lost the ability to induce morphological transformation, but have retained a mitogenic function. Thus an early and dramatic difference between wild-type virus and hr-t mutant-infected cultures of rat fibroblasts is the morphological change in individual cells observed by light, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. Viruses containing an intact hr-t function (wild-type virus and ts-a mutants) induce a transformed phenotype consisting of stellate cell shape, loss of defined cytoplasmic actin architecture, cellular ""underlapping,"" and increased nuclear and nucleolar sizes. These prominent alterations constitute an abortive transformation, peaking 24-48 hr post-infection, and subsequently resolving in most or all of the cells. In contrast, cells infected with hr-t mutants do not develop the above structural changes, but rather retain their preinfection appearance. Both wild-type virus and hr-t mutants induce cellular DNA synthesis in confluent monolayers of rat cells beginning 12-14 hr post-infection. Flow microfluorometric (FMF) analysis confirms the viral mediated transit of cells from the G1 to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, as well as an increase in the proportion of cells with an 8N (octaploid) DNA content. Approximately 50% of the clones isolated from wild-type-infected cultures are polyploid. Stable transformants are found among these polyploid clones, but the majority of the latter resemble the parental cells in their morphology and growth properties. Polyploid clones are derived from hr-t mutant-infected cultures at a much lower frequency, similar to that of mock-infected cultures. Data obtained by sequential labeling of infected cultures with 3 H-thymidine and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine, together with cell number quantitation, indicate that hr-t mutants promote only a single round of cell division, while the wild-type virus and ts-a mutants promote multiple rounds. Loss of the hr-t function in polyoma virus therefore reveals a residual viral mitogenic activity, but prevents the virus from effecting morphological transformation of cells with concomitant loss of defined actin cables, polyploidization and multiple cycles of cell division in confluent cultures.","Schlegel, R;Benjamin, T L"
210954,1978,Cell,Isolation and characterization of a siderophore-like growth factor from mutants of SV40-transformed cells adapted to picolinic acid.,"We have isolated mutants of SV40-transformed BALB/3T3 cells adapted to grow in picolinic acid. A line of cells, derived from the mutant cells, that multiplies in the absence of serum has also been characterized. From ultrafiltrates of medium conditioned by contact with these cell lines, we have identified and partially purified a highly specific iron-binding ligand termed siderophore-like growth factor (SGF). Experiments have indicated that the factor is a peptide(s) of approximately 1600 daltons. In nanogram amounts, SGF solubilizes and binds Fe 3+ in vitro and stimulates the uptake of Fe 3+ in vivo. The Fe 3+ uptake preceded the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by the factor in the mutant cell lines. The factor could not be separated into Fe 3+ binding and DNA synthetic activity, suggesting that the early iron uptake is an integral component of the proliferative response. These data support the hypothesis that SGF is representative of a family of mammalian siderophores which may have an important role in cell proliferation.","Fernandez-Pol, J A"
208777,1978,Cell,Mutants of SV40 with an altered small t protein are reduced in their ability to transform cells.,"Mutants of SV40 with deletions of various sizes mapping between 0.54 and 0.59 on the genome grow at a rate equal to or slightly slower than that of wild-type virus, in a range of host cells. Their ability, however, to induce transformation in several mouse, rat and rabbit cell lines is impaired. The extent of transformation observed is dependent upon the assay used to measure it, but in general, the ability of the mutants to transform falls as the size of the deletion increases. In addition, rat embryo fibroblasts transformed by deletion mutants have fewer of the characteristics of a fully transformed phenotype (for example, growth in low serum, increased saturation density, growth in semi-solid medium) than those transformed by wild-type virus. During lytic infection, immunoprecipitable T antigen produced by the deletion mutants is of the same size as that seen during infection with wild-type virus, and is present at a similar level. Mutant virus-coded small t protein, however, is reduced in size compared with that from wild-type virus. For each mutant, the reduction in protein size is dependent upon the amount of DNA deleted, but not on the relative position of the deletion in the genome. These results demonstrate that the DNA sequences mapping between 0.54 and 0.59 on the viral genome code for the small t protein, and that SV40-induced transformation is at least partially dependent upon the expression of this protein.","Sleigh, M J;Topp, W C;Hanich, R;Sambrook, J F"
657270,1978,Cell,The relationship between transformation and somatic mutation in human and Chinese hamster cells.,"The frequencies of transformations of primary human and Chinese hamster fibroblasts have been compared with the spontaneous and induced frequencies of mutation for resistance to thioguanine and ouabain, and for ability to use fructose, using the carcinogens benzo (alpha) pyrene and urethane. Whereas the rates and frequencies of mutation were similar in the two cell systems, transformations to morphologically altered cells was observed only in hamster cells. The frequency of this latter transformation event in hamster cells was abour 10(3) greater than the frequencies of mutation in these cells. The morphologically altered cells formed in the above transformation process cannot grow in agar (aga-) and do not produce tumors when injected into animals. The frequency of transition of these latter cells to aga+ cells which produce tumors in animals is similar to the mutation-like events.","Spandidos, D A;Siminovitch, L"
350415,1978,Cell,Tubulin and actin in paired nonneoplastic and spontaneously transformed neoplastic cell lines in vitro: fluorescent antibody studies.,"Pairs of nonneoplastic and spontaneously transformed neoplastic cells were derived from rat, mouse and hamster embryos. The neoplastic cells of each pair had poorly spread cellular morphology, grew in agarose in vitro and produced invasive sarcomas in vivo; the nonneoplastic cells exhibited none of these properties. The distribution of microtubules and microfilament bundles (stress fibers or actin cables) was examined in five such paired lines and in 3T3 and SV40-transformed 3T3 cells by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy of fixed cells treated with rabbit antibody prepared against bovine brain tubulin or guinea pig smooth muscle actin, respectively. Actin cables in all the neoplastic cells appeared thinner and more sparse than in the paired nonneoplastic cells. These differences were also observed in living cells with polarization microscopy. In contrast, microtubules appeared similar in neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells, both in areas of thin peripheral lamellar cytoplasm which allowed a clear visualization of fine, curving microtubules and in regions of thick, central endoplasm which obsecured individual microtubules. In fact, the main morphological difference between neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells was the relative amount of lamellar cytoplasm or endoplasm, rather than the appearance of microtubles in either region. Thus the distinctive growth properties and retracted cellular morphology of neoplastic cells in this study did not correlate with decreased or disorganized microtubules, but with thin and sparse actin cables.","Tucker, R W;Sanford, K K;Frankel, R"
207438,1978,Cell,Avian myelocytomatosis and erythroblastosis viruses lack the transforming gene src of avian sarcoma viruses.,"Using labeled cDNA specific for the detection of the src gene of avian sarcoma viruses, we find that avian myelocytomatosis virus strain MC29 and avian erythroblastosis virus strain ES4 lack nucleotide sequences related to the src gene. Furthermore, chicken fibroblasts as well as hematopoietic cells, infected and transformed with these viruses, show no enhanced level of transcription of the cellular nucleotide sequences related to the src gene of avian sarcoma viruses. These two viruses may thus contain their own transforming gene(s) or induce cellular genes unrelated to the src-like cellular sequences.","Stéhelin, D;Graf, T"
207435,1978,Cell,Identification of a transformation-specific protein induced by a Rous sarcoma virus.,"Using antisera obtained from rats bearing Schmidt-Ruppin strain Rous sarcoma virus-induced tumors, we have idnetified a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.3 in extracts of chick embryo fibroblasts transformed by a wild-type nondefective Rous sarcoma virus (Schmidt-Ruppin strain). This protein was not found in cells infected by trnasformation-defective mutants with either a partial or complete deletion of the src gene, nor in cells infected by a nontransforming avian leukosis virus. The 56,000 dalton molecular weight protein was found to be synthesized at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures in cells infected by either of two conditionallethal mutants that are temperature-sensitive in cell transformation. The amount of this protein, however, accumulated in cells infected by these temperature-sensitive mutants, relative to the structural polypeptides, differed significnatly from that seen with the nondefective virus. Pulsechase experiments indicate that the protein is extremely unstable, with a half-life of about 20 min, and does not serve as a precursor to any of the detectable virion polypeptides. Furthermore, incubation of the rat antiserum with purified, disrupted virus did not affect its immunoreactivity to this particular protein. We conclude that this 56,000 dalton molecular weight protein is a nonstructural protein specific to cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus.","Jay, G;Shiu, R P;Jay, F T;Levine, A S;Pastan, I"
207433,1978,Cell,Introduction of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene into mouse cells using virus DNA or transformed cell DNA.,"Cells lacking the enzyme thymidine kinase (LMTK- cells) have been transformed to a kinase-positive phenotype using sheared herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA, and the enzyme found in these transformed cells is HSV-specific. One of the cell lines is able to complement the functional defect found in two temperature-sensitive mutants of HSV 1, and reversion of the cells to a thymidine kinase-negative phenotype results in the loss of this capability. The HSV thymidine kinase gene can also be introduced into LMTK- cells using DNA extracted from transformed cells, and the high efficiency of this procedure suggests that the state of the virus DNA in transformed cells is different from that of DNA in virus particles.","Minson, A C;Wildy, P;Buchan, A;Darby, G"
77735,1978,Cell,Merocyanine 540 as a fluorescent probe of membranes: selective staining of leukemic and immature hemopoietic cells.,"We have reported (Easton, Valinsky and Reich, 1978) that merocyanine 540 (MC 540) specifically stains a variety of living excitable cells, but not nonexcitable cells. This paper describes the exceptional permeability to MC 540 of leukemic leukocytes and immature hemopoietic precursor cells. We have used fluorescence microscopy and uptake of radioactive dye to study MC 540 staining of peripheral blood leukocytes from 80 leukemic and 34 normal individuals; leukemic leukocytes stain, whereas normal leukcytes do not. The leukocyte staining reaction differs from that previously described for excitable cells since it is independent of the ionic composition of the staining medium, kinetically complex, enhanced by light, enhanced by oxygen and essentially irreversible. Virtually all circulating nucleated cells from leukemic individuals are stained to approximately the same extent, and there is no qualitative or quantitative distinction between the various forms of leukemia. We have also found that MC 540 interacts with granulopoietic colony-forming cells (CFU-C) and with spleen colony-forming cells derived from mouse bone marrow (CFU-S). We cannot as yet identify a specific property of leukocyte plasma membranes that determines MC 540 permeability; since changes in MC 540 uptake appear to be correlated with cellular maturation during normal hemopoiesis, the retention of staining by leukemic cells, some of which appear morphologically normal, may indicate of failure in membrane maturation during leukemic blood cell development.","Valinsky, J E;Easton, T G;Reich, E"
627038,1978,Cell,Polypeptide maps of cells infected with murine type C leukemia or sarcoma oncovirus.,"The polypeptide composition of murine fibroblast cells and the effect of infection by RNA sarcoma and leukemia viruses were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tryptic peptide mapping. The polypeptide maps of NIH Swiss mouse embryo fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) and BALB/c mouse embryo fibroblasts (BALB/3T3) were very similar except for two major polypeptides of about 65,000 and 75,000 daltons which were not detected in BALB/3T3 cells. NIH/3T3 cells infected with either Rauscher or Gross oncoviruses and outbred Swiss mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T3 FL) showed two major polypeptrides of about 73,000 and 80,000 daltons not found in uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. The 3T3 FL cells, although uninfected, were also found to contain a high concentration of envelope glycoprotein of an endogenous oncovirus. 3T3 FL cells transformed by Moloney sarcoma virus showed changes in many polypeptides, including several major components: the disappearance or modification of a component of 60,000 daltons, an increased concentration and shift in pl of a glycoprotein of 48,000 daltons, and the apparent loss of several smaller polypeptides. None of the major changes of the transformed cells were associated with cell surface proteins labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination.","Strand, M;August, J T"
203405,1978,Cell,Characteristics of cellular RNA related to the transforming gene of avian sarcoma viruses.,"Nucleotide sequences (sarc) related to the transforming gene of avian sarcoma viruses are present in the DNA and transcribed into RNA in uninfected avian cells (Stehelin et al., 1976b; Spector et al., 1978). Cytoplasmic RNA containing the sarc sequences has a sedimentation coefficient of 30S, is linked to polyadenylic acid and is present in polyribosomes in a form which can be released by treatment with EDTA. Hence the sarc sequences (complexity = 5 x 10(5) daltons) are part of a larger transcriptional unit (approximately 1.8 x 10(6) daltons), and the sarc RNA appears to serve an as yet unknown messenger function. In addition, the sarc sequences in chicken cells are not linked to RNA transcribed from the provisrus of the endogenous virus RAV-O, since RAV-O cytoplasmic RNA has sedimentation coefficients of 32S and 21S. Comparison of sarc-containing RNA in quail embryo fibroblasts and in quail cells derived from a methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma revealed no differences with respect to size, polyadenylation or concentration of the RNA in nuclei, cytoplasm and polyribosomes; thus the phenotypic differences between these cells are unlikely to be a consequence of alteration in expression of the sarc sequences.","Spector, D H;Baker, B;Varmus, H E;Bishop, J M"

The distribution of 10 nm filaments in normal cells was studied during growth, spreading, locomotion, mitosis, and after treatment with colchicine and cytochalasin B. The 58,000 dalton subunit protein is apparently all polymerized in the filaments which are insoluble in nonionic detergent. The distribution of 10 nm filaments is altered by colchicine treatments which disrupt microtubules. The organization of 10 nm filaments is altered in transformed cells.","Hynes, R O;Destree, A T"
202400,1978,Cell,Isolation and characterization of T antigen-negative revertants from a line of transformed rat cells containing one copy of the SV40 genome.,"Negative selection with FUdR produced revertants from the transformed rat line 14B, which contains one insertion of the SV40 viral genome (Botchan, Topp and Sambrook, 1976). 14B contains nuclear T antigen, grows to a high density, grows in low serum and is anchorage-independent. The revertants fall into three classes with regard to viral DNA sequences: the SV40 DNA is retained; the SV40 DNA is retained but has undergone a deletion; and the SV40 DNA is lost, generating a cured cell. This heterogeneity is not a result of long-term passage. The revertants arise with a frequency of one in 8.4 X 10(5) cells after as few as 12 passages. All three classes of revertants are T antigen-negative, density-sensitive, more serum sensitive than 14B and anchorage-dependent. These data argue for a direct role of the functioning viral genome in the maintenance of the transformed state, and that with 14B, the phenotypes of transformation are not virus gene dosage-dependent.","Steinberg, B;Pollack, R;Topp, W;Botchan, M"
922888,1977,Cell,Germ line integration of moloney leukemia virus: effect of homozygosity at the m-mulV locus.,"Mice genetically transmitting the exogenous Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) have been previously derived. These animals carried one copy of M-MuLV DNA in their germ line and were heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus (Jaenisch, 1976). Experiments were performed to investigate whether homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus would be compatible with normal development. Animals heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus were mated [female (+/-) X male(+/-)] and the genotype of the offspring was analyzed. Molecular hybridization experiments revealed three classes of offspring carrying two copies (++), one copy (+/-) and no (--) M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences, respectively, in their liver DNA. Genetic experiments indicated that males of the first class transmitted the virus to 100% of their offspring, males of the second class to 50% and males of the third class not at all when mated with normal females. These results demonstrated that homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus has no detectable effect on normal development of the animals and that the M-MuLV gene is transmitted from one generation to the next strictly according to Mendelian expectations. Development of M-MuLV-induced leukemia is not influenced by the genotype of these animals--that is, animals carrying two or one copies of M-MuLV in their germ line or animals congenitally infected from the mother developed disease at similar rates.","Jaenisch, R"
200369,1977,Cell,Abelson virus-transformed lymphocytes: null cells that modulate H-2.,"A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells from Balb/c mice had the properties of null lymphocytes. They did not secrete Ig and all but one did not have detectable cell-associated Ig; one line synthesized, but did not secrete, the mu chain of IgM. The cells expressed H-2D and H-2K, but not H-21 histocompatibility antigens or theta-antigen; they had Fc receptors. Most cell lines grew to form donor cell tumors after inoculation into (Balb/c X C57B1/6)F1 mice. The tumor cells have more H-2Dd than cells passaged in vitro. Cell lines carried in vitro progressively lost H-2Dd. A line in which 5-30% of the cells were lysable by anti-H-2Dd was cloned; all eleven clones had H-2Dd (13-69% lysable) demonstrating that H-2 modulates in vitro. A clone with little H-2Dd (10-15% lysable) was tumorigenic even after treatment with anti-H-2Dd sera; at least 50% of the tumor cells were lysed by anti-H-2Dd. Thus A-MuLV-transformed lymphocytes modulate H-2 in vivo to higher levels and in vitro to lower levels.","Pratt, D M;Strominger, J;Parkman, R;Kaplan, D;Schwaber, J;Rosenberg, N;Scher, C D"
200367,1977,Cell,The display of microtubules in transformed cells.,"Monospecific tubulin antibodies have been used in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on a variety of well characterized, transformed cell lines grown in tissue culture. Networks of colcemid-sensitive fibers are seen in SV40-transformed 3T3 cells, SV40-transformed rat embryo cells, HeLa cells and other transformed cell lines. In each case, greater than 90% of the cells contain visible microtubular networks, and where individual microtubules can be distinguished, they run for long distances. Documentation of these metworks is more difficult in transformed than in normal cells, because transformed cells are in general more rounded and have less well spread cytoplasm. In addition, the microtubular networks can be readily visualized in ""cytoskeletons"" of both normal and transformed cells, obtained by treatment of cells with nonionic detergents in a buffer which stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Addition of calcium to this buffer results in in situ fragmentation and destruction of the microtubular network. In view of these results, we conclude that transformed cells contain significant numbers of microtubules, and that in transformed cells, as in normal cells, microtubules are arranged in networks.","Osborn, M;Weber, K"
72612,1977,Cell,Localization of serum-derived alpha 2 macroglobulin in cultured cells and decrease after Moloney sarcoma virus transformation.,"NRK cells and many other cultured fibroblasts were found to contain the protease inhibitor, alpha 2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M). This alpha 2M is present as a result of uptake of alpha 2M from the calf serum in the culture medium. Some of this alpha 2M is released back into the medium. In radiolabeling experiments with 14C-amino acids, no radioactivity was detected in intracellular or extracellular alpha 2M. Fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells using rhodamine-labeled antibodies indicated that alpha 2M is present in vesicular organelles different from primary lysosomes. Fluorescence microscopy of living cells shows that rhodamine-labeled alpha 2M (rhodamine-alpha 2M) is taken up into similar structures. Of the many cell lines examined, Moloney sarcoma virus-transformed cells had the lowest amounts of alpha 2M. Some of the effects of serum on the behavior of cultured cells could be a consequence of inhibition of cellular proteases by alpha 2M.","Pastan, I;Willingham, M;Anderson, W;Gallo, M"
332382,1977,Cell,Cytoplasmic microtubules in transformed mouse x nontransformed human cell hybrids: correlation with in vitro growth.,"Patterns of cytoplasmic microtubules in somatic cell hybrids between transformed mouse cells and nontransformed human skin fibroblasts were examined using antitubulin antibodies as an immunofluorescent probe. Nontransformed cells have been shown to exhibit an extensive cytoplasmic microtubule complex (CMTC), while in transformed cells, this complex is greatly diminished. The hybrid populations contained both types of cells. In addition, they contained cells with previously undescribed intermediate CMTC phenotypes. The percentage of each phenotype present in hybrid populations was determined for sixteen hybrid clones. Seven clones were found which appeared transformed on the basis of their CMTC pattern. The others were comprised of various proportions of all the cell types described. Repeated quantitation of the proportions of these types in the hybrid populations showed them to be stable with time in culture. Growth in vitro of the hybrid clones was assayed by determining their saturation densities, their plating efficiencies on plastic and their colony-forming abilities in soft agar. In vitro growth of a cell population was found to be directly proportional to the percentage of cells in the population which showed the greatly diminished CMTC pattern which has been described for transformed cells. This is strong evidence that a greatly reduced CMTC is associated with transformed behavior, especially the increased capacity of transformed cells for in vitro growth.","Miller, C L;Fuseler, J W;Brinkley, B R"
196767,1977,Cell,The extensive homology between mRNA sequences of normal and SV40-transformed human fibroblasts.,"The poly(A)-containing messenger RNA of normal diploid fibroblast and SV40-transformed progeny cells are compared by cross-hybridizing cDNA. We find a high degree of homology between the mRNA from normal and transformed cells. Despite imperfections in the procedure, the technique permits the conclusion that, at most, 3% of the mRNA in the transformed cell has sequences not present in the normal parental cell. Furthermore, much of the difference appears to occur in low and intermediate complexity classes of mRNA molecules. Extension homology in the mRNA sequences of disparate cell lines may be a general phenomenon, and even HeLa cell mRNA is nearly identical to that of diploid human fibroblasts.","Williams, J G;Hoffman, R;Penman, S"
196766,1977,Cell,Transformation of chondroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus and synthesis of the sulfated proteoglycan matrix.,"The presence of the extracellular matrix synthesized by chondroblasts provides a barrier to virus penetration. Chondroblasts can be infected and transformed following treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Using a temperature-sensitive transformation mutant of Rous sarcoma virus and rearing the cells at permissive temperature, we demonstrate that transformed chondroblasts stop synthesizing their cell-unique sulfated proteoglycan. If such transformed chondroblasts are shifted to nonpermissive temperature, the cells reinitiate the synthesis of their cell-unique sulfated proteoglycan.","Pacifici, M;Boettiger, D;Roby, K;Holtzer, H"
196765,1977,Cell,Transformation of chicken embryo retinal melanoblasts by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus.,"Retinal melanoblasts were transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (ts-RSV). At the permissive temperature for transformation, the cells cease melanin synthesis, degrade their melanosomes and release much of their accumulated melanin into the medium. At the nonpermissive temperature, the cells assume an epithelioid morphology, actively synthesize melanin and become difficult to distinguish from normal uninfected control cultures. Both the transformed phenotype and the differentiated cell phenotype are temperature-dependent. Infected retinal melanoblasts which are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature and which accumulate a large amount of melanin are unable to transform in response to a temperature shift; instead, the cells degenerate and die. Retinal melanoblasts can be infected by subgroups A, B, C and D of RSV; however, their level of susceptibility to infection is about 1/40 compared to fibroblasts. Cultures infected by ts-RSV produce virus at both temperatures, suggesting that cell phenotype does not regulate virus synthesis.","Boettiger, D;Roby, K;Brumbaugh, J;Biehl, J;Holtzer, H"

When grown in complete medium, wild-type SV40-transformed cells had more forks per unit length of DNA than nontransformed cells. In isoleucine-depleted medium, wild-type SV40-transformed cells had fewer forks per unit length than those few nontransformed cells (1-3% of the population) which continued DNA replication. Cells transformed by a tsA mutant of SV40 when grown at the permissive temperature had more forks per unit length in complete medium and fewer forks per unit length in depleted medium than nontransformed cells, but when grown at the restrictive temperature, the tsA-transformed cells behaved like nontransformed cells.","Martin, R G;Oppenheim, A"
195741,1977,Cell,Properties of mammalian cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of avian sarcoma virus.,"Fibroblasts from European field vole (Microtus agrestis) and from normal rat kidney (NRK) have been infected by avian sarcoma virus mutants which are temperature-sensitive for the maintenance of transformation. These cells are transformed at 33 degrees C, but show normal cell characteristics in morphology, colony formation in agar, saturation density, sugar uptake and membrane proteins at 39 degrees C and 40 degrees C, the nonpermissive temperatures. Ts mutant virus was rescued from most of the ts transformed cell lines. NRK cells infected by avian sarcoma virus ts mutants and kept at the nonpermissive temperature can be transformed by wild-type avian sarcoma virus. The susceptibility of the temperature-sensitive NRK lines to this transformation is higher than the susceptibility of uninfected NRK at either permissive or nonpermissive temperature.","Chen, Y C;Hayman, M J;Vogt, P K"
406048,1977,Cell,Double immunoglobulin production in cloned somatic cell hybrids between two human lymphoid cell lines.,"Several clones of independently established somatic cell hybrids between two human lymphoid cell lines, Raji and Namalwa, were examined for surface immunoglobulin expression. Double-antibody radioimmunoassays were established for kappa and lambda light chains. Immunoglobulins were detergent-extrated by Triton X-100 and quantified by radioimmunoassay. The Raji parent expressed small amounts of kappa chains on its surface, and the Namalwa parent a 10 fold greater amount of lambda chains. We show that the majority of the hybrid clones co-express both parental phenotypes.","Rosén, A;Clements, G;Klein, G;Zeuthen, J"
326414,1977,Cell,"Restoration of normal morphology, adhesion and cytoskeleton in transformed cells by addition of a transformation-sensitive surface protein.","Transformed cells lack a large, external, transformation-sensitive (LETS) glycoprotein which is a major surface component of their normal counterparts. Addition of LETS glycoprotein isolated from normal cells to transfomed cells restores certain morphological features and adhesive properties characteristic of normal cells. LETS protein is detected on the cell surface both by iodination using lactoperoxidase and by immunofluorescent staining. The surface distribution pattern detected by immunofluorescence is strikingly similar to that of normal cells. After addition of LETS protein, transformed cells also exhibit well defined actin cables which are not seen in untreated, transformed cells. All these alterations can be blocked by treating LETS protein with specific antisera or by subjecting it to mild trypsinization prior to addition to transformed cells. The effects are rapidly reversible by mild trypsinization, which removes the added LETS protein. The high rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, characteristic of transformed cells, is not affected by LETS protein. These results suggest that LETS protein may have a role in cell attachment and spreading, and affect the organization of cytoskeleton.","Ali, I U;Mautner, V;Lanza, R;Hynes, R O"
194709,1977,Cell,Continuous tissue culture cell lines derived from chemically induced tumors of Japanese quail.,"Several continuous tissue culture cell lines were established from methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas of Japanese quail. The lines consist either of fibroblastic elements, round refractile cells or polygonal cells. They show transformed characteristics in agar colony formation and hexose uptake, and most are tumorigenic. Their cloning efficiency in plastic dishes is not increased over that of normal quail embryo fibroblasts. The quail tumor cell lines do not produce endogenous avian oncoviruses and fail to complement the Bryan high titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus; those tested lack the p27 protein of avian oncoviruses. Most of the cell lines are susceptible to subgroup A avian sarcoma viruses, but are relatively resistant to viruses of subgroups C, E and F as compared to normal quail embryo fibroblasts.","Moscovici, C;Moscovici, M G;Jimenez, H;Lai, M M;Hayman, M J;Vogt, P K"
194702,1977,Cell,"Cyclic AMP-induced cytolysis in S49 cells: selection of an unresponsive ""deathless"" mutant.","Wild-type S49 lymphoma cells respond to cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) by inducing cAMP phosphodiesterase, halting growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and subsequently dying. By using a counter selection procedure, we have isolated a new class of mutants of S49 cells termed ""deathless"" that are resistant to cytolysis, but otherwise respond like the wild-type cells to cAMP. Upon removal of the cyclic nucleotide, D-cells resume their normal growth. Unlike all other cAMP-resistant mutants of S49 cells isolated until now, the D- mutant has a functionally normal cAMP-dependent protein kinase and retains normal ability to induce phosphodiesterase and arrest cell growth in G1. It is probable that the altered gene product of the D- mutant is distal to protein kinase and in a biochemical pathway separate from that of cAMP induction of phosphodiesterase or growth arrest. The D- mutant may facilitate studies of the mechanism of cAMP-induced cytolysis and growth regulation in S49 cells.","Lemaire, I;Coffino, P"

This series of adenovirus-transformed cell lines exhibits an oncogeni spectrum ranging from being tumorigenic in immunocompetent rats through to nontumorigenic in adult nude mice. The relevance of the in vitro findings to growth potential in vivo is discussed.","Gallimore, P H;McDougall, J K;Chen, L B"
191197,1977,Cell,Loss of Fv-1 restriction in Balb/3T3 cells following infection with a single N tropic murine leukemia virus particle.,"The ability of various murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) to replicate in mouse cells exhibiting Fv-1 restriction was analyzed by quantitative dose-response assays. In particular, the effect of infection with N, B, or NB tropic MuLVs on Fv-1b restriction in Balb/3T3 cells was measured with an infection center technique in which pseudotypes of murine sarcoma virus (MSV), which have been shown to exhibit Fv-1 dependence of expression, were used to quantitate the degree of restriction. The resulting dose-response curves indicate that productive infection of a single Balb/3T3 cell with N tropic MSV requires co-infection with two MuLV particles. These two MuLV particles are functionally distinguishable. One of them must be N tropic and must be added less than 18 hr after infection with N tropic MSV. The second MuLV particle, on the other hand, need not be N tropic and may be added at any time. Balb/3T3 cultures infected with sufficient N tropic MuLV become fully permissive to transformation by N tropic MSV and to productive infection by N tropic MuLV. This effect, termed ""abrogation"" of Fv-1 restriction, results from infection of a Balb/3T3 cell with a single N tropic MuLV particle, but apparently occurs without viral replication. It seems probable that a requirement for abrogation of Fv-1b restriction by a single infectious particle of N tropic MuLV, which does not itself replicate, is responsible for the two-hit dose-response relationship observed in infectivity titrations of N tropic MuLV in Balb/3T3 cells. The requirements that N tropic MuLV be added within a specified time period with regard to N tropic MSV in order for abrogation to occur suggests that in the absence of N tropic MuLV, the cellular Fv-1b restriction mechanism inactivates N tropic MSV by 9 hr after infection.","Duran-Troise, G;Bassin, R H;Rein, A;Gerwin, B I"
837450,1977,Cell,"Procollagen and collagen produced by a teratocarcinoma-derived cell line, TSD4: evidence for a new molecular form of collagen.","Procollagen and collagen were isolated from the culture medium and cell layer of line TSD4 (obtained from mouse teratocarcinoma OTT6050). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the highly purified procollagen fraction demonstrated that the fraction is composed of theta chains (150,000 daltons), pro alpha chains (130,000 daltons), and alpha chains (100,000 daltons). Limited pepsin digestion of this fraction yielded a single species of collagen molecules having a chain composition (alpha1)3, as did collagen isolated from the cell layer. Each alpha1 chain appears to be slightly larger than alpha1 chains from calf or human type I and type III collagen. Amino acid analysis and cyanogen bromide peptide profiles of pepsin-treated TSD4 collagen demonstrated significant differences from those of other collagens (II, III, IV) of the type alpha1(X)3, although similar to that of the alpha1 chain of type I collagen, [alpha1(1)]2alpha2. Taken together, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, electron microscopy, and cyanogen bromide peptide analysis indicate that this material represents a new molecular species of collagen not previously characterized, probably related to [alpha1(I)]3.","Little, C D;Church, R L;Miller, R A;Ruddle, F H"
189938,1977,Cell,Differential genetic susceptibility of cultured human skin fibroblasts to transformation by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus.,"Hereditary adenomatosis of the colon and rectum (ACR), an autosomal dominant trait, is associated with a predisposition to neoplasia. The present study describes the differential genetic susceptibility of cultured human skin fibroblasts to transformation by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. Primary cutaneous outgrowths were derived from normal appearing subepidermal biopsies of ACR phenotypes and appropriate controls. Exponentially growing cell cultures from ACR subjects and a portion of the clinically asymptomatic ACR progeny subjected to the viral probe were 100-1000 fold more susceptible to transformation than were normal skin fibroblast cultures. The virally transformed human skin fibroblasts showed a loss of anchorage dependency in carboxymethylcellulose suspension and formed tumors in athymic mice. The results suggest that skin fibroblasts obtained from individuals gine sarcoma virus.","Pfeffer, L M;Kopelovich, L"
189937,1977,Cell,Teratocarcinoma differentiation: plasminogen activator activity associated with embryoid body formation.,"Changes in plasminogen activator activity have been examined as a clonal line of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells aggregate and differentiate to form cystic embryoid bodies in vitro. Within the first 10 days of study, the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells aggregate; a layer of endodermal cells appears on the outside of the aggregate forming an embryoid body; a basement membrane forms between the outer layer of endodermal cells and the internal cells; a cyst forms within the embryoid body; and the internal cells assume a columnar appearance along the inner portion of the basement membrane. After the formation of the endodermal layer, there is a rise in intracellular plasminogen activator activity. This rise continues for up to 25 days in culture, providing that the three-dimensional integrity of the embryoid bodies is maintained by culturing them on bacterial petri dishes. Selective removal of the outer endodermal layer of cells reduces the plasminogen activatory activity of the resulting embryoid body cores. Intracellular and secreted plasminogen activator activity of simple embryoid bodies composed of only two cell types can be increased by culturing the embryoid bodies in dbcAMP, theophylline, or cholera toxin. These results suggest that the embryoid body endodermal cells are the source of a cAMP-inducible plasminogen activator activity.","Linney, E;Levinson, B B"
837442,1977,Cell,Development of methods for the quantitative in vitro analysis of androgen-dependent and autonomous Shionogi carcinoma 115 cells.,"Androgen-dependent and androgen-independent (autonomous), cloned, cultured cell lines of the androgen-dependent mouse mammary adenocarcinoma, Shionogi carcinoma 115, have been established. Growth of the dependent cells requires the presence of androgen, provided they are growth in suspension culture in medium containing dextran-charcoal-treated fetal calf serum. The growth rate of autonomous cells in the presence or absence of DHT is similar to that of dependent cells grown in its presence. An agar culture method has been developed that enables the proportion of dependent and autonomous cells in mixed populations to be determined. Autonomous cells appear in dependent clones, and their frequency increases with increasing time of subculture. Dependent cells form tumors preferentially in male animals and dependent cell cytosols contain significant amounts (approximately 300 femtomoles per mg protein) of a specific androgen-binding macromolecule. Autonomous cells formed tumors equally well in both male and female mice, and autonomous cell cytols contain very low levels (less than or equal to 7 femtomoles per mg protein) of the specific androgen-binding macromolecule(s). These studies delineate a system which can be used to investigate the mechanism of steroid hormone-dependent and autonomous tumor growth, and the transitions between the hormone-dependent and autonomous states.","Stanley, E R;Palmer, R E;Sohn, U"
837440,1977,Cell,Integrated viral sequences in adenovirus type 12-transformed hamster cells.,"The physical state of the viral genome in four lines of hamster cells transformed by adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) has been investigated. The four lines of transformed cells originated from hamster cells after infection with Ad12 at multiplicities ranging from 5-350 plaque-forming units per cell. The DNA from transformed cells has been restricted with the Sal I endonuclease from Streptomyces albus which cleaves adenovirus DNA more frequently than DNA from adenovirus-transformed hamster cells. Thus after cleavage by the Sal I enzyme, it is possible to separate free adenovirus DNA sequences from these which are covalently linked to cellular DNA in transformed hamster cells. The results of sequential hybridization experiments in which the Sal I-treated DNA from transformed cells is first annealed to Ad12 DNA on filters, then eluted, and finally hybridized to hamster cell DNA, support the model of Ad12 DNA integrated in multiple fragments into the host genome. Further experiments will be required to characterize the host sequences adjacent to adenovirus DNA and to compare these sequences in different lines of Ad12 transformed cells.","Groneberg, J;Chardonnet, Y;Doerfler, W"
189934,1977,Cell,Decreased adherence to the substrate in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts.,"Cell-substrate adherence in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts was examined by determining the number of cells which could be detached from the culture dish by a stream of medium. Transformed cells were significantly less adherent than their normal counterparts. In cultures infected with a mutant of Rous sarcoma virus which is temperature-conditional for transformation, adherence changed promptly following a temperature shift. This change did not require progression through the cell cycle. The transformation-specific decrease in adherence required new protein synthesis, but the restoration of adherence which occurred following a shift to the restrictive temperature could occur in the absence of new protein synthesis. Inhibitor experiments suggested the importance of microfilaments and perhaps microtubules in the changes in detachability. In addition, there was a positive correlation between levels of surface LETS protein and cell substrate adherence following a temperature shift, although it seems probable that the bulk of the surface LETS is neither necessary nor sufficient for maintenance of normal cell substrate adherence.","Weber, M J;Hale, A H;Losasso, L"
65230,1977,Cell,Cells transformed by certain strains of Moloney sarcoma virus contain murine p60.,"It was previously demonstrated that the 60,000 dalton (p60) precursor-like polyprotein containing murine p30 was a constituent of the feline leukemia virus pseudotype of Moloney sarcoma virus [m1MSV(FeLV)]. It is now shown that p60 is detected  in cells of five mammalian species transformed by m1MSV, indicating that p60 is specified by this genome. Moreover, little or no murine p30 is detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, suggesting that the murine group p30 antigenic reactivity of S + L- cells is ude to p60. Pulse-chase studies in cells producing m1MSV(FeLV) show that p60 is the largest polypeptide detectable during the pulse, and that intracellular p60 is not cleaved into smaller (for example, p30) polypeptides during chase periods of up to 10 hr. The lack of cleavage of p60 is in contrast to the properties of p30 precursors detected in cells containing replicating avian or mammalian RNA tumor viruses. The inefficient cleavage of intracellular p60 and the kinetics of appearance of murine p30 in extracellular m1MSV(FeLV) suggest that p60 cleavage to p30 occurs in cells shortly before virus release. While only p60 was detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, p60 and p70 were detected in m3MSV-transformed cells, and no immunoprecipitable polypeptides were detected in HT-1 MSV-transformed cells. The observed differences in the intracellular polypeptide expression by each of the strains of MSV suggests differences in genetic content.","Robey, W G;Oskarsson, M K;Vande Woude, G F;Naso, R B;Arlinghaus, R B;Haapala, D K;Fischinger, P J"
189941,1976,Cell,Transformation of cultured human vascular endothelium by SV40 DNA.,"Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) developed extensive cytopathic changes and necrosis after high multiplicity infection with wild-type SV40 virus. Using the calcium co-precipitation technique, stable transformation was obtained with purified preparations of intact circular SV40 DNA and restriction endonuclease-derived linear DNA fragments containing the entire early gene region. Smooth muscle cells, isolated from the same blood vessels, showed neither cytopathic effects nor transformation after similar treatment with SV40 virus or DNA. The HEC cultures transformed by SV40 (SVHEC) expressed SV40-specific T (tumor) and Tr (transplantation) antigens, but not V (viral capsid) antigen. No evidence of infectious virus production was found upon co-cultivation with the CV-1 line of monkey kidney cells. Transformation resulted in markedly increased growth potential, loss of anchorage dependence and topoinhibition of growth, and a reduced serum requirement. Prolonged subcultivation was accompanied by chromosomal abnormalities and eventual ""crisis"". Transformed cells did not exhibit endothelial-specific organelles (Weibel-Palade bodies) or factor VIII antigen, but angiotensin-converting enzyme occasionally was detectable in SVHEC cultures. SV40-transformed human vascular endothelium, a nonfibroblast diploid cell type, may be useful in studies of oncogenesis and control of the differentiated state.","Gimbrone, M A;Fareed, G C"
64304,1976,Cell,A core polyprotein of murine leukemia virus on the surface of mouse leukemia cells.,"A polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 75,000 daltons, p(75), was identified on the surface of AKR spontaneous leukemia cells by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radio-iodination. This protein was shown by immunoprecipitation to have antigenic determinants of MuLV p30, p15, and p10, but not gp70, suggesting that p(75) represents a polyprotein composed of virion core components. As evidenced by studies on incorporation of radioactive glucosamine, p(75) is probably glycosylated. No p(75) was found on 2 month old AKR thymocytes, and only a small amount of p(75) was detectable of thymocytes from 4 month old animals. However, substantial quantities of p(75) could be found on thymocytes from 6 month old, yet still preleukemic mice.","Tung, J S;Yoshiki, T;Fleissner, E"

The location of viral sequences among the fragments of transformed cell DNA was determined by autoradiography. The DNAs of seven of the cell lines contained viral sequences in fragments of many different sizes. The remaining four cell lines each contain a single insertion of viral DNA at a different chromosomal location.

We have isolated such a major cell surface glycoprotein from chick embryo fibroblasts; this protein, CSP, is decreased after transformation.

987856,1976,Cell,"Characterization of two different alkaline phosphatases in mouse teratoma: partial purification, electrophoretic, and histochemical studies.","Alkaline phosphatase (E.C.3.1.3.1.) has been used as a marker for embryonal carcinoma cells which constitute the multipotential stem cells of the mouse teratoma. Studies by other investigators based on kinetics of thermal inactivation and L-phenylalanine inhibition have shown that the alkaline phosphatase of the teratoma differs from the mouse intestinal and liver isozymes, but resembles the isozymes of kidney and placenta. Since functional characterization of nonpurified enzymes is not the most accurate means for distinguishing different molecular forms of an enzyme, we have partially purified the enzymes from the ascitic (embryoid body) and solid tumor forms of the OTT-6050 teratoma line, and utilized the technique of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels to compare the teratoma enzyme with isozymes from kidney and placenta. Covalent 32PO4-labeling of the alkaline phosphatases and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate was also used to compare the subunit molecular weights of the enzymes. The results indicate that the mouse teratoma enzyme is distinct from the kidney and placental isozymes. Since histochemical studies have localized the enzyme to the stem cell population of the teratoma, the results imply that stem cell alkaline phosphatase is a distinct isozyme. The embryoid bodies contain a second alkaline phosphatase which may correspond to the placental isozyme. This enzyme may be attributed to the outer cell layer of embryoid bodies of the ascitic tumor, since this cell type histochemically demonstrates alkaline phosphatase activity.","Wada, H G;VandenBerg, S R;Sussman, H H;Grove, W E;Herman, M M"
975240,1976,Cell,Studies on the activity of the X chromosomes in female teratocarcinoma cells in culture.,"Embryonal carcinoma cells derived from murine teratocarcinomas are able to differentiate into the same variety of tissue types as early embryonic cells. Because embryonal carcinoma cells resemble those of the embryo at a stage before X chromosome inactivation has occurred in females embryonal carcinoma cells containing two X chromosomes were examined to determine whether both are genetically active. The specific activities of X-linked enzymes were measured in embryonal carcinoma cells containing either one or two X chromosomes. The activities in both cell types were similar, suggesting that only one X chromosome was active in the female cells. Further support for this conclusion came from experiments in which azaguanine-resistant mutants were recovered with similar frequencies from embryonal carcinoma cell lines containing one and two X chromosomes. Late replication of an X chromosome DNA was detected in one embryonal carcinoma cell line with two X chromosomes but not in another. This suggests that cells of these two lines were arrested at different developmental stages, and that late DNA replication may not be a necessary adjunct of X inactivation. Evidence is presented which suggests that X chromosome reactivation does not occur during differentiation of the cells in vitro.","McBurney, M W;Adamson, E D"

954096,1976,Cell,Insulin receptors in normal and transformed fibroblasts: relationship to growth and transformation.,"The insulin receptors in normal and transformed lines of mouse Balb/3t3 fibroblasts have been studied. In the normal fibroblasts, the binding of insulin was low in growing cells and increased 2-9 fold in confluent stationary cells. Insulin binding was increased whether growth arrest was due to contact inhibition of growth or serum starvation. When serum-starved cells were stimulated to grow by the addition of fresh serum, insulin binding declined. In cells transformed by simian virus 40, Kirsten, Moloney, and Harvey sarcoma viruses, methylcholanthrene, X rays, or spontaneously, the binding was low, in the same range as growing normal cells. In simian virus 40-transformed cells, insulin binding increased 4 fold as the cells reached higher densities in culture. No relationship to changes in cell size was found. The differences in binding were due to changes in the concentration of the receptors, without changes in their affinity for the hormone.","Thomopoulos, P;Roth, J;Lovelace, E;Pastan, I"

The hybrid nature of these cells was established by HAT or HAT-ouabain selective procedures, their chromosome number, and, in one case, H-2 surface antifen expression. Three hybrid cell lines are described here in detail: an IgG2B, K X LgG2a, k; an IgG1, k X IgG2b, k; and an IgG1, k X IgM, Lambda. In all cases, both parental types of H and L chains are expressed in the hybrid cells and no new chains are observed. However, molecules possessing disulfide-bonded mixtures of parental H and/or L chains are seen. Analysis of subclones of these hybrids indicates considerable stability in the expression of the immunoglobulins for up to 13 months. However, segregant clones no longer synthesizing one or more of the parental H or L chains arise frequently.","Margulies, D H;Kuehl, W M;Scharff, M D"

Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that single Kirsten sarcoma virus (KiSV)-transformed cells passed between the epithelial cells of the  CAM ectoderm within 6 hr of application, while viable NIH/3T3 cells did not penetrate the ectoderm within 24 hr. The transformed cells entered the mesoderm of the CAM and formed tumors of proliferating cells. The application of 5 X 10(5) KiSV-transformed cells resulted in the formation of donor cells resulted in the formation of the donor cell tumors within 5 days in 43% of the membranes. No tumors were formed when as many as 5 X 10(6) NIH/3T3 cells were applied to the membrane. NIH/3T3 cells transformed by the Abelson leukemia virus or the Moloney sarcoma virus also ivaded the CAM and formed tumors of proliferating cells within the mesoderm, while cells infected with the Moloney leukemia virus did not. NIH/3T3 cells inoculated onto the CAM 8 days after infection and transformation with KiSV formed tumors with a frequency similar to that of KiSV transformed cells that have been passaged in culture for many generations.

Two independently derived preparations of anti-sera from hamsters bearing group C adenovirus tumors were tested for antibody against the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. One antiserum contained antibodies that reacted with these DNA-binding proteins, while the second antiserum did not contain detectable levels of antibody. Five adenovirus type 2 transformed rat cell lines were tested for the presence of the single-stranded specific DNA-binding proteins. Two of the five transformed cells expressed detectable levels of this protein. These results indicate that the group C adenovirus single-strand specific DNA-binding proteins are expressed in some, but not all, adenovirus tumors and transformed cell lines. Those transformed cell lines (type 2) containing a portion of the adenovirus genome designated by the Eco R-I-B restriction enzyme fragment express the single-strand specific DNA-binding proteins. Those cell lines missing this Eco R-I-B fragment do not contain this viral protein. Other experiments have located the structural gene of the signle-strand specific DNA-binding protein in the Eco-R-I-B DNA fragment, indicating that when this gene is present in a transformed cell, it is expressed.","Levinson, A;Levine, A J;Anderson, S;Osborn, M;Rosenwirth, B;Weber, K"
947550,1976,Cell,A unique pattern of integrated viral genes in hamster cells transformed by highly oncogenic human adenovirus 12.,"We have analyzed the viral DNA sequences persisting in HE C19, a clonal line of hamster embryo cells transformed in vitro by human adenovirus 12 (Ad 12), a member of highly oncogenic group A. Saturation-hybridization of in vitro labeled Ad 12 DNA (2-4 x 10(8) cpm/mug) with HE C19 DNA showed that 93-100% of viral DNA sequences are present in the transformed cell. Reassociation of Ad 12 32P-DNA in the presence of HE C19 DNA detected 8 viral genome equivalents per diploid quantity of cell DNA. REannealing each of the six Ad 12 EcoRl restriction DNA fragments with HE C19 DNA indicated that the sequences of each fragment are present in near equimolar quantities, 8-10.5 copies per cell. HE C19 DNA ""networks"" were prepared and shown to contain the same viral DNA sequences and in the same amounts as present in unfractionated transformed cell DNA; these data provide the first direct evidence that human adenovirus genes are covalently linked to cellular DNA. The presence of most, if not all, of the viral genes was demonstrated also in the Ad 12 hamster tumor cell line, HT-2. The pattern of integrated viral genes in these nonpermissive hamster cells transformed by Ad 12 is different from that described for cells transformed by group C and B human adenoviruses and for SV40.","Green, M R;Chinnadurai, G;Mackey, J K;Green, M"
947549,1976,Cell,Feminization of hepatic S metabolism in male rats with a transplanted (MtT/F4).,"After transplantation of MtT/F4 pituitary tumor cells to male rats of the Fisher strain, the masculine type of hepatic steroid metabolism was changed into a feminine pattern of enzyme activities. Liver metabolism of steroid hormones in female rats was relatively unaffected following transplantation of pituitary tumor cells. Futhermore, extract from MtT/F4 tumors and ""autonomous"" pituitary tissue increased the 5alpha-reductase activity of hepatoma cells in the culture (HTC cells) at subsaturation concentrations of the substrate 4-androstene-3, 17-dione by decreasing the apparent Km of the enzyme. It is concluded that the pituitary tumor (in accord with the secretion from an ""autonomous"" pituitary gland) secretes ""feminotropin,"" a novel hypophyseal principle that probably is an important regulator of hepatic steriod metabolism. It is suggested that pituitary tumor tissue of the MtT/F4 type could be used as source of feminotropin in purification studies.","Eneroth, P;Gustafsson, J A;Larsson, A;Skett, P;Stenberg, A;Sonnenschein, C"
133760,1976,Cell,Androgen-dependent fibrinolytic activity in a murine mammary carcinoma (Shionogi SC-115 cells) in vitro.,"Physiological concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) can specifically induce the release of fibrinolysin from androgen-dependent mammary carcinoma (Shionogi SC-115) cells in vitro. No fibrinolytic activity was observed in cells cultured either in the absence of DHT or presence of pharmacological concentrations of estrogen. Furthermore, an autonomous tumor derived from the Shionogi SC-115 cells produced fibrinolytic activity independent of added DHT or estrogen. These observations suggest a close correlation between fibrinolytic activity of a tumor and its ability to grow in vivo.","Mak, T W;Rutledge, G;Sutherland, D J"
181139,1976,Cell,Accumulation of cystine auxotrophic thymocytes accompanying type C viral leukemogenesis in the mouse.,"Certain continuous lymphoid and myeloid tumor cell lines of rodent origin are unable to grow in tissue culture in the absence of pre-formed L-cystine (CYS). In contrast, three NZB murine lymphoid cell lines obtained from NZB mice free of hematopoietic neoplasm can grow as well in cystine-deficient media containing L-cystathionine (CSN), the immediate precursor of CYS in the biosynthetic pathway, as in cystine sufficient medium. The former class of cells is, therefore, CYS auxotrophs (CYS-) and the latter CYS prototrophs (CYS+). Compared to CYS+ cells, the CYS- lines appear to be relatively deficient in the enzyme cystathionase, which catalyzes the cleavage of CSN to CYS and alpha-ketobutyrate. Using protein synthetic capacity as a criterion, normal thymocytes from mixed-bred Swiss mice behave like CYS prototrophs, while those from littermates bearing Moloney type C virus-induced thymic tumors behave like CYS auxotrophs. The former are also characterized by substantially higher levels of cystathionase than the latter. Extracts of thymocytes from tumor-free AKR mouse thymus are also characterized by higher levels of cystathionase activity than extracts of spontaneous AKR thymomas. Exogenous in vitro type C virus infection of a CYS+ cell results in vigorous virus production but no concomitant reduction in cystathionase activity. Thus viral replication alone in any random lymphoid cell is not sufficient to alter the enzyme level. The data therefore suggests that CYS auxotrophy may closely accompany neoplastic transformation of certain hematopoietic cells in vivo, including that induced by certain ""thymic"" type C viruses.","Livingston, D M;Ferguson, C;Gollogly, R;Lazarus, H"
1052770,1975,Cell,Formation of a keratinizing epithelium in culture by a cloned cell line derived from a teratoma.,"From a transplantable mouse teratoma it has been possible to derive an established keratinizing cell line (XB) which grows well in cultures containing lethally irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts at the correct density. Single cells of the keratinizing line grow into colonies each consisting of a stratified squamous epithelium. The keratinizing nature of the colonies has been demonstrated by specific staining with Rhodanile blue, and by light and electron microscopy of sections through the colonies. A function of fibroblasts appears to be a strict requirement for keratinization and an important though less strict requirement for cell growth. The fibroblast function can be carried out by medium harvested from 3T3 cultures. It is possible to detect keratinizing colonies in primary cultures of disaggregated teratoma cells combined with 3T3 cells. Such colonies appeared in cultures of a transplantable teratoma with an overall frequency of 6 X 10(-6) of the cells plated. Nonkeratinizing colonies of cells with otherwise very similar appearance were about 10 fold more abundant. Since both the keratinizing and the related nonkeratinizing colonies can be identified in the living state, it is possible to isolate them from the primary cultures.","Rheinwald, J G;Green, H"
1052769,1975,Cell,Thy-1 variants of mouse lymphomas: biochemical characterization of the genetic defect.,"The surface proteins of Thy-1 positive mouse lymphomas and Thy-1 negative variants were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulphate and by immunological studies. The loss of the serologically defined Thy-1 antigenic determinant correlated with the absence of a radioactive band corresponding to a T lymphocyte-specific surface glycoprotein, T25, on autoradiographs of the iodinated proteins of Thy-1 negative variants. Reexpression of Thy-1 on hybrid cells dervied from fusions of complementary Thy-1 negative variants correlated with the reappearance of T25. Quantitative absorption studies using an antiserum which specifically recognized T25 confirmed that the Thy-1 negative variants have no detectable T25 (less than 0.03 of that of the Thy-1 positive lines) on their surface. Biosynthetic labeling studies revealed that none of the Thy-1 negative variants synthesized T25. However, synthesis of an immunologically cross-reactive molecule could be detected in two variants. On the basis of these results, we propose a model which describes a possible structure of the Thy-1 antigenic determinant and explains the biochemical nature of the genetic lesions leading to the loss of Thy-1 in these variants.","Trowbridge, I S;Hyman, R"
1182804,1975,Cell,Fibrinolytic activity in a human fibrosarcoma cell line and evidence for the induction of plasminogen activator secretion during tumor formation.,"Seven clones were isolated from the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line using a fibrinagarose overlay technique. Three of these clones induced lysis of the fibrin overlay, whereas four did not. The extracellular and intracellular levels of protease were then measured using 125I-fibrin plates incubated with acid-treated human serum. The extracellular protease can be directly assayed in the medium from cells incubated with 10% fetal calf serum. Although there were large differences in the amounts of protease secreted by these two sets of clones, the intracellular levels of protease were similar. No significant differences were found between the abilities of the cells to grow in soft agar or as tumors in immunosuppressed hamsters. However, cells grown from tumors derived from all the low secretors of protease showed an increase in the amount of protease secreted. It appeared, therefore, that the secretion of protease might be selected for or induced during tumor growth. Further detailed studies with one of the low secreting clones (clone E) suggested an inductive rather than a selective mechanism for this increase in extracellular plasminogen activator.","Jones, P A;Laug, W E;Benedict, W F"
171081,1975,Cell,"Synthesis, surface deposition, and secretion of immunoglobulins by Abelson virus-transformed lymphosarcoma cell lines.","Three Abelson virus-transformed lymphoma cell lines were established in tissue culture and the immunoglobulin biosynthesis by these cell lines was studied. Two of the cell lines (ABLS-1 and ABLS-5) were found to synthesize monomeric IgM molecules which were deposited in the cell membrane, probably to serve as an antigen receptor. The third cell line (ABLS-8) was found to synthesize membrane-associated IgM as well as cellular IgG molecules. In addition, these cell lines were found to synthesize a protein of 35,000 molecular weight which is also membrane-associated and which has the capability to bind the immunoglobulin (MAID). It is speculated that this protein might play a role in adapting the receptor immunoglobulin molecule to the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane. The kinetics of amino acid incorporation into immunoglobulins by these cell lines show that they produce immunoglobulins at a rate which is two orders of magnitude smaller than plasmacytoma cells (MOPC 104E). These results suggest that Abelson virus transforms thymus-independent lymphocytes in various stages of maturation and these lymphocytes might be of B cell origin. The T lymphoma (P1798) used as a control cell line was found occasionally to produce minute amounts of immunoglobulin.","Premkumar, E;Potter, M;Singer, P A;Sklar, M D"
170002,1975,Cell,"Creatine kinase, myokinase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in muscle-forming primary cultures of mouse teratocarcinoma cells.","Multipotential mouse teratocarcinoma cells in embryoid bodies were explanted on plastic or collagen substrates. Various modes of cell determination, including myogenesis, occurred. The predominant avenue of differentiation soon became myogenesis: many multinucleated myotubes formed and yielded an extensive network of skeletal muscle fibers. The process does not proceed to normal completion, as the fibers have a paucity of striations and are not contractile. Activities of several enzymes ordinarily associated with muscle differentiation were examined. Acetylcholinesterase activity increases, especially during myotube formation, as in normal myogenesis. However, creatine kinase activity rises during myotube formation and then drops abnormally, and myokinase activity fails to increase appreciably. The fetal isozymic form of creatine kinase is expressed in the cultures, although well differentiated solid tumors taken from mice show attainment of the adult muscle isozyme type if skeletal muscle is demonstrably present. The results are consistent with the interpretation that coordinately regulated changes in gene expressions controlling these functions may be required for later stages of myogenesis.","Gearhart, J D;Mintz, B"
807334,1975,Cell,Synthesis of erythrocyte-specific proteins in cultured friend leukemia cells.,"We have studied synthesis of specific proteins in two permanent lines of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia cells (Friend line 745 and Ostertag line FSD-1, both derived from DBA/2 mice). By 96 hr following treatment with 1-2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), up to 25% of the protein being synthesized by both these cultures is hemoglobin. At that time, hemoglobin constitutes up to 10% of the cellular soluble protein. Both lines synthesize heme and globin coordinately, and alpha and beta globin chains in a nearly balanced 1:1 ratio. However, the ratio of betaMajor:betaMinor chains synthesized by these induced Friend leukemia (FL) cells is approximately 9 in the FSD-1 line and 1.3 in the Friend Clone 745 line, whereas it is 4 in normal adult DBA/2 mouse erythrocytes. Evidence for the latter conclusion was obtained by electrophoresis of FL hemoglobins on cellulose acetate membranes, and also by chromatographic separation of alpha, betaMajor, and betaMinor globins on carboxymethylcellulose in 8 M urea at 20 degrees C. Carbonic anhydrase activity per mg protein is 3 times higher in induced than in control cultures. 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid is not found in induced FL cells. Induced and control FL cells agglutinate strongly and equally with Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The developmental process in these cultured leukemia cells appears to be an aberrant erythropoiesis.","Kabat, D;Sherton, C C;Evans, L H;Bigley, R;Koler, R D"
167984,1975,Cell,Fibrin overlay methods for the detection of single transformed cells and colonies of transformed cells.,"Fibrin overlay methods are described which can detect the plasminogen activator produced by single transformed cells or small colonies of transformed cells. These methods were applied to malignant cells derived from humans, mice, hamsters, rats, and chicks. The lysis observed was plasminogen dependent. Transformation of chicken cells by Rous sarcoma virus was detected 4 days after infection. The number of lysis zones produced was proportional to the virus inoculum and was identical to the number of morphologically determined foci. These methods may also have application in model systems for scoring transformation by chemicals. Transformed mouse and chicken cells were detected at the single cell level and the number of lysis zones produced was dependent on the number of cells present, the time of incubation, and the concentration of plasminogen.","Jones, P;Benedict, W;Strickland, S;Reich, E"
167983,1975,Cell,Effects of cycloheximide on virus RNA replication in an inducible line of polyoma-transformed rat cells.,"In this article, we describe two distinct effects of cycloheximide (CH), a potent inhibitior of protein synthesis, on the replication of polyoma virus (PV) DNA in an inducible line of PV-transformed rat cells (LPT cells). Exposure of LPT cells to CH causes up to an 8 fold increase in the cellular concentration of PV DNA determined by molecular hybridization. The same treatment inhibits cell division and chromosomal DNA replication. However, the amount of chromosomal DNA per cell is not affected by the drug. In LPT cells treated with mitomycin C (MMC), PV DNA replication is enhanced after 7 hr. During the period extending from 7 hr to 24 hr, the concentration of virus DNA increases at least 100 fold. CH added to the cells 0-7 hr after treatment with MMC inhibits the replication of PV DNA by 90-100%. The inhibition is less effective in cells exposed to CH from 7 hr and on. The inhibitory effect is reversible: virus DNA synthesis is resumed after removal of CH from the growth medium. Thus CH acts as an inducer of virus DNA synthesis in cells whose resident viral genome is repressed, but inhibits the autonomous replication of the activated genome following induction with MMC.","Manor, H;Neer, A"
167981,1975,Cell,Inhibition of protease activity in cultures of rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells: effect on the transformed phenotype.,"We have examined the role of proteolytic activity in the genesis and maintenance of the transformed phenotype by growing cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts transfromed by Rous sarcoma virus either in medium containing plasminogen-free serum or in medium to which protease inhibitors were added. Alterations in morphology, adhesiveness, and hexose transport were used as markers for the transformed state. Addition of the trypsin inhibitors NPGB or Soy Bean Trypsin Inhibitor at concentrations which inhibited transformation-associated fibrinolysis restored adhesiveness and morphology to near normal, but did not affect the rate of hexose transport. Growth of Rous-infected cells in plasminogen-free medium blocked the appearance of morphological and adhesive alterations, but allowed the rate of hexose transport to increase to the transformed level. Thus we were able to separate the appearance of transformation-specific changes in morphology and adhesiveness (which apparently require fibrinolytic activity) from the increased rate of hexose transport (which is independent of fibrinolytic activity). Another trypsin inhibitor, TLCK, although it did not inhibit fibrinolysis, was very effective at restoring adhesiveness and morphology as well as hexose transport to normal. This raises the possibility that there is another, perhaps earlier, protease involved in the genesis of the transformed phenotype.","Weber, M J"
125153,1975,Cell,Hydrolase and serum treatment of normal chick embryo cells: effects on hexose transport.,"We have asked whether treatment of normal cultured cells with proteases, other hydrolytic enzymes, or serum can convert them into transient phenocopies of transformed cells with respect to the very high rate of hexose transport characteristic of transformed cells. Treatment of density-inhibited cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts with trypsin, plasmin, neuraminidase, or hyaluronidase stimulated their rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake to a level only marginally higher than that seen in normal exponentially growing cultures, and only 35-45% of that seen in transformed cultures. Addition of the hydrolytic enzymes to growing cell cultures had little effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Serum, however, could stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake all the way up to the transformed level. Even though the hydrolases and serum differed in their ability to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake, both reagents were capable of stimulating cell division equally well. Evidence is presented suggesting that the hexose transport rate is controlled by serum factors, and that proteolysis can affect the response of the cells of these factors.","Hale, A H;Weber, M J"
1170023,1975,Cell,Isolation of heat- and cold-sensitive mutants of chinese hamster lung cells affected in their ability to express the transformed state.,"A clone of spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster lung cells was exposed to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG), and six heat-sensitive and three cold-sensitive mutants were isolated after selection for inability to form colonies in soft agar at 39.5 degrees C and 34.5 degrees C, respectively. The heat-sensitive mutants had growth characteristics of transformed cells at 34.5 degrees C, but exhibited a normal phenotype at 39.5 degrees C. By contrast, cold-sensitive mutants displayed the characteristics of the normal cells at 34.5 degrees C and converted to a transformed phenotype at 39.5 degrees C. Transformed parent cells exhibited no obvious temperature-dependent properties. Temperature shift experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of both types of mutants was fully reversible. All of the mutants were able to grow well at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures when grown on the surface of plastic dishes. Such mutants will be useful in analysis of factors involved in the expression of the transformed state or the maintenance of the nontransformed state.","Miyashita, K;Kakunaga, T"
806346,1975,Cell,Characterization of light chain and light chain constant region fragment mRNAs in MPC 11 mouse myeloma cells and variants.,"Cultured MPC 11 mouse myeloma cells synthesize not only gamma2b heavy and kappa light chains but also a carboxyl terminal (constant region) fragment of kappa light chain. In vitro translational analysis of total cytoplasmic and microsomal RNA indicates that these cells contain RNA which directs synthesis of both a light chain precursor and a light chain fragment precursor. Variant clones which do not synthesize either heavy or light chains continue to synthesize the light chain fragment. One such ""nonproducing"" variant was studied in detail. It does not contain translatable mRNA for the intact light chain but does contain RNA which is translated into the light chain fragment precursor. Nucleic acid hybridization analysis with a cDNA probe specific for the constant region of kappa light chains revealed that microsomal RNA from the wild-type cell contains both 14S and a 10S species of kappa specific RNA, whereas the variant contains only the 10S species. Translational analysis of these same RNAs indicates that the 14S species codes for the light chain precursor, while the 10S RNA codes for the light chain fragment precursor.","Kuehl, W M;Kaplan, B A;Scharff, M D"
164291,1975,Cell,Chicken leukosis virus genome sequences in DNA from normal chick cells and virus-induced bursal lymphomas.,"Genome sequences of two recent field isolates of avian leukosis viruses in the DNA of normal and neoplastic chicken cells were studied by DNA-RNA hybridization under conditions of DNA excess. Comparisons were made between 60-70S RNA from these viruses and that of a chicken endogenous type C virus (RAV-0), and of a series of ""laboratory"" leukosis and sarcoma viruses, by competitive hybridization analysis. A minimum of 18% of the genome sequences of both ALV isolates detected in DNA from lymphomas they induced were not detected in normal chicken DNA. The vast majority of the fraction of RNA sequences from ALV which do form hybrids with normal chick DNA appear to be reacting with the endogenous provirus of RAV-0. The genomic representation of a variety of avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses in normal chicken cells could not be distinguished by these methods (except that 13% of the RAV-0 genome was not shared with any of the other viruses). In contrast, the portion of the ALV genome exogenous to the normal chicken geome showed significant divergence from that of two sarcoma viruses (Pr RSV-C and B-77). The increased hybridization of ALV RNA with lymphoma DNA was used to detect the appearance of ALV specific sequences in the bursa of Fabricius following infection.increased hybridization was correlated with both the time after infection and the extent of replacement of the bursa by lymphoma. About one half of the increase in hybridization preceded histologic evidence of transformation.","Neiman, P E;Purchase, H G;Okazaki, W"
164289,1975,Cell,SV40-transformed cells with temperature-dependent serum requirements.,"We have isolated temperature-sensitive SV40-transformed 3T3 cells which are unable to grow in low or depleted serum at the nonpermissive temperature. At 39 degrees C, these cells do not grow in 1 percent serum, but they grow if the serum concentration is raised to 10 percent. At 32 degrees they grow in both serum concentrations. This phenotype seems to be due to a cellular mutation, as the virus rescued from these cells is wild-type. We tested whether other characteristics of transformed cells were expressed in a temperature sensitive way. While high saturation density is ts in these cells, other parameters of transformation are expressed at both temperatures. In addition, when these cells are incubated in low serum at 39 degrees C, they keep synthesizing DNA and lose viability very fast, while under the same conditions normal 3T3 cells remain viable for long times and are unable to initiate DNA synthesis. These cells therefore do not appear to revert to a normal phenotype at the high temperature, and they are more likely to represent transformed cell variants with a temperature-dependent serum requirement.","Toniolo, D;Basilico, C"
