31171880,2019,Nature medicine,Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses reveal distinct stage-specific phenotypes of the gut microbiota in colorectal cancer.,"In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616 participants who underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.","Yachida, Shinichi;Mizutani, Sayaka;Shiroma, Hirotsugu;Shiba, Satoshi;Nakajima, Takeshi;Sakamoto, Taku;Watanabe, Hikaru;Masuda, Keigo;Nishimoto, Yuichiro;Kubo, Masaru;Hosoda, Fumie;Rokutan, Hirofumi;Matsumoto, Minori;Takamaru, Hiroyuki;Yamada, Masayoshi;Matsuda, Takahisa;Iwasaki, Motoki;Yamaji, Taiki;Yachida, Tatsuo;Soga, Tomoyoshi;Kurokawa, Ken;Toyoda, Atsushi;Ogura, Yoshitoshi;Hayashi, Tetsuya;Hatakeyama, Masanori;Nakagama, Hitoshi;Saito, Yutaka;Fukuda, Shinji;Shibata, Tatsuhiro;Yamada, Takuji"

31068703,2019,Nature medicine,The landscape of cancer cell line metabolism.,"Despite considerable efforts to identify cancer metabolic alterations that might unveil druggable vulnerabilities, systematic characterizations of metabolism as it relates to functional genomic features and associated dependencies remain uncommon. To further understand the metabolic diversity of cancer, we profiled 225 metabolites in 928 cell lines from more than 20 cancer types in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This resource enables unbiased association analysis linking the cancer metabolome to genetic alterations, epigenetic features and gene dependencies. Additionally, by screening barcoded cell lines, we demonstrated that aberrant ASNS hypermethylation sensitizes subsets of gastric and hepatic cancers to asparaginase therapy. Finally, our analysis revealed distinct synthesis and secretion patterns of kynurenine, an immune-suppressive metabolite, in model cancer cell lines. Together, these findings and related methodology provide comprehensive resources that will help clarify the landscape of cancer metabolism.","Li, Haoxin;Ning, Shaoyang;Ghandi, Mahmoud;Kryukov, Gregory V;Gopal, Shuba;Deik, Amy;Souza, Amanda;Pierce, Kerry;Keskula, Paula;Hernandez, Desiree;Ann, Julie;Shkoza, Dojna;Apfel, Verena;Zou, Yilong;Vazquez, Francisca;Barretina, Jordi;Pagliarini, Raymond A;Galli, Giorgio G;Root, David E;Hahn, William C;Tsherniak, Aviad;Giannakis, Marios;Schreiber, Stuart L;Clish, Clary B;Garraway, Levi A;Sellers, William R"
31011208,2019,Nature medicine,Immunogenic neoantigens derived from gene fusions stimulate T cell responses.,"Anti-tumor immunity is driven by self versus non-self discrimination. Many immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer have taken advantage of tumor neoantigens derived from somatic mutations. Here, we demonstrate that gene fusions are a source of immunogenic neoantigens that can mediate responses to immunotherapy. We identified an exceptional responder with metastatic head and neck cancer who experienced a complete response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, despite a low mutational load and minimal pre-treatment immune infiltration in the tumor. Using whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing, we identified a novel gene fusion and demonstrated that it produces a neoantigen that can specifically elicit a host cytotoxic T cell response. In a cohort of head and neck tumors with low mutation burden, minimal immune infiltration and prevalent gene fusions, we also identified gene fusion-derived neoantigens that generate cytotoxic T cell responses. Finally, analyzing additional datasets of fusion-positive cancers, including checkpoint-inhibitor-treated tumors, we found evidence of immune surveillance resulting in negative selective pressure against gene fusion-derived neoantigens. These findings highlight an important class of tumor-specific antigens and have implications for targeting gene fusion events in cancers that would otherwise be less poised for response to immunotherapy, including cancers with low mutational load and minimal immune infiltration.","Yang, Wei;Lee, Ken-Wing;Srivastava, Raghvendra M;Kuo, Fengshen;Krishna, Chirag;Chowell, Diego;Makarov, Vladimir;Hoen, Douglas;Dalin, Martin G;Wexler, Leonard;Ghossein, Ronald;Katabi, Nora;Nadeem, Zaineb;Cohen, Marc A;Tian, S Ken;Robine, Nicolas;Arora, Kanika;Geiger, Heather;Agius, Phaedra;Bouvier, Nancy;Huberman, Kety;Vanness, Katelynd;Havel, Jonathan J;Sims, Jennifer S;Samstein, Robert M;Mandal, Rajarsi;Tepe, Justin;Ganly, Ian;Ho, Alan L;Riaz, Nadeem;Wong, Richard J;Shukla, Neerav;Chan, Timothy A;Morris, Luc G T"

Here we generated a new anti-CD19 CAR molecule (CD19-BBz(86)) derived from the CD19-BBz prototype bearing co-stimulatory 4-1BB and CD3ζ domains. We found that CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cells produced lower levels of cytokines, expressed higher levels of antiapoptotic molecules and proliferated more slowly than the prototype CD19-BBz CAR T cells, although they retained potent cytolytic activity. We performed a phase 1 trial of CD19-BBz(86) CAR T cell therapy in patients with B cell lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02842138 ).

31011205,2019,Nature medicine,Genomic and transcriptomic profiling expands precision cancer medicine: the WINTHER trial.,"Precision medicine focuses on DNA abnormalities, but not all tumors have tractable genomic alterations. The WINTHER trial ( NCT01856296 ) navigated patients to therapy on the basis of fresh biopsy-derived DNA sequencing (arm A; 236 gene panel) or RNA expression (arm B; comparing tumor to normal). The clinical management committee (investigators from five countries) recommended therapies, prioritizing genomic matches; physicians determined the therapy given. Matching scores were calculated post-hoc for each patient, according to drugs received: for DNA, the number of alterations matched divided by the total alteration number; for RNA, expression-matched drug ranks. Overall, 303 patients consented; 107 (35%; 69 in arm A and 38 in arm B) were evaluable for therapy. The median number of previous therapies was three. The most common diagnoses were colon, head and neck, and lung cancers. Among the 107 patients, the rate of stable disease ≥6 months and partial or complete response was 26.2% (arm A: 23.2%; arm B: 31.6% (P = 0.37)). The patient proportion with WINTHER versus previous therapy progression-free survival ratio of >1.5 was 22.4%, which did not meet the pre-specified primary end point. Fewer previous therapies, better performance status and higher matching score correlated with longer progression-free survival (all P < 0.05, multivariate). Our study shows that genomic and transcriptomic profiling are both useful for improving therapy recommendations and patient outcome, and expands personalized cancer treatment.","Rodon, Jordi;Soria, Jean-Charles;Berger, Raanan;Miller, Wilson H;Rubin, Eitan;Kugel, Aleksandra;Tsimberidou, Apostolia;Saintigny, Pierre;Ackerstein, Aliza;Braña, Irene;Loriot, Yohann;Afshar, Mohammad;Miller, Vincent;Wunder, Fanny;Bresson, Catherine;Martini, Jean-François;Raynaud, Jacques;Mendelsohn, John;Batist, Gerald;Onn, Amir;Tabernero, Josep;Schilsky, Richard L;Lazar, Vladimir;Lee, J Jack;Kurzrock, Razelle"
31011202,2019,Nature medicine,An organoid platform for ovarian cancer captures intra- and interpatient heterogeneity.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is a heterogeneous disease usually diagnosed at a late stage. Experimental in vitro models that faithfully capture the hallmarks and tumor heterogeneity of OC are limited and hard to establish. We present a protocol that enables efficient derivation and long-term expansion of OC organoids. Utilizing this protocol, we have established 56 organoid lines from 32 patients, representing all main subtypes of OC. OC organoids recapitulate histological and genomic features of the pertinent lesion from which they were derived, illustrating intra- and interpatient heterogeneity, and can be genetically modified. We show that OC organoids can be used for drug-screening assays and capture different tumor subtype responses to the gold standard platinum-based chemotherapy, including acquisition of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Finally, OC organoids can be xenografted, enabling in vivo drug-sensitivity assays. Taken together, this demonstrates their potential application for research and personalized medicine.","Kopper, Oded;de Witte, Chris J;Lõhmussaar, Kadi;Valle-Inclan, Jose Espejo;Hami, Nizar;Kester, Lennart;Balgobind, Anjali Vanita;Korving, Jeroen;Proost, Natalie;Begthel, Harry;van Wijk, Lise M;Revilla, Sonia Aristín;Theeuwsen, Rebecca;van de Ven, Marieke;van Roosmalen, Markus J;Ponsioen, Bas;Ho, Victor W H;Neel, Benjamin G;Bosse, Tjalling;Gaarenstroom, Katja N;Vrieling, Harry;Vreeswijk, Maaike P G;van Diest, Paul J;Witteveen, Petronella O;Jonges, Trudy;Bos, Johannes L;van Oudenaarden, Alexander;Zweemer, Ronald P;Snippert, Hugo J G;Kloosterman, Wigard P;Clevers, Hans"
30962585,2019,Nature medicine,Systemic clinical tumor regressions and potentiation of PD1 blockade with in situ vaccination.,"Indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (iNHLs) are incurable with standard therapy and are poorly responsive to checkpoint blockade. Although lymphoma cells are efficiently killed by primed T cells, in vivo priming of anti-lymphoma T cells has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoma cells can directly prime T cells, but in vivo immunity still requires cross-presentation. To address this, we developed an in situ vaccine (ISV), combining Flt3L, radiotherapy, and a TLR3 agonist, which recruited, antigen-loaded and activated intratumoral, cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs).

30936549,2019,Nature medicine,Platelet GPIbα is a mediator and potential interventional target for NASH and subsequent liver cancer.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), potentially progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that platelet number, platelet activation and platelet aggregation are increased in NASH but not in steatosis or insulin resistance. Antiplatelet therapy (APT; aspirin/clopidogrel, ticagrelor) but not nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment with sulindac prevented NASH and subsequent HCC development. Intravital microscopy showed that liver colonization by platelets depended primarily on Kupffer cells at early and late stages of NASH, involving hyaluronan-CD44 binding. APT reduced intrahepatic platelet accumulation and the frequency of platelet-immune cell interaction, thereby limiting hepatic immune cell trafficking. Consequently, intrahepatic cytokine and chemokine release, macrovesicular steatosis and liver damage were attenuated. Platelet cargo, platelet adhesion and platelet activation but not platelet aggregation were identified as pivotal for NASH and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis. In particular, platelet-derived GPIbα proved critical for development of NASH and subsequent HCC, independent of its reported cognate ligands vWF, P-selectin or Mac-1, offering a potential target against NASH.","Malehmir, Mohsen;Pfister, Dominik;Gallage, Suchira;Szydlowska, Marta;Inverso, Donato;Kotsiliti, Elena;Leone, Valentina;Peiseler, Moritz;Surewaard, Bas G J;Rath, Dominik;Ali, Adnan;Wolf, Monika Julia;Drescher, Hannah;Healy, Marc E;Dauch, Daniel;Kroy, Daniela;Krenkel, Oliver;Kohlhepp, Marlene;Engleitner, Thomas;Olkus, Alexander;Sijmonsma, Tjeerd;Volz, Julia;Deppermann, Carsten;Stegner, David;Helbling, Patrick;Nombela-Arrieta, César;Rafiei, Anahita;Hinterleitner, Martina;Rall, Marcel;Baku, Florian;Borst, Oliver;Wilson, Caroline L;Leslie, Jack;O'Connor, Tracy;Weston, Christopher J;Adams, David H;Sheriff, Lozan;Teijeiro, Ana;Prinz, Marco;Bogeska, Ruzhica;Anstee, Natasha;Bongers, Malte N;Notohamiprodjo, Mike;Geisler, Tobias;Withers, Dominic J;Ware, Jerry;Mann, Derek A;Augustin, Hellmut G;Vegiopoulos, Alexandros;Milsom, Michael D;Rose, Adam J;Lalor, Patricia F;Llovet, Josep M;Pinyol, Roser;Tacke, Frank;Rad, Roland;Matter, Matthias;Djouder, Nabil;Kubes, Paul;Knolle, Percy A;Unger, Kristian;Zender, Lars;Nieswandt, Bernhard;Gawaz, Meinrad;Weber, Achim;Heikenwalder, Mathias"
30936548,2019,Nature medicine,Metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets identifies cross-cohort microbial diagnostic signatures and a link with choline degradation.,"Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.","Thomas, Andrew Maltez;Manghi, Paolo;Asnicar, Francesco;Pasolli, Edoardo;Armanini, Federica;Zolfo, Moreno;Beghini, Francesco;Manara, Serena;Karcher, Nicolai;Pozzi, Chiara;Gandini, Sara;Serrano, Davide;Tarallo, Sonia;Francavilla, Antonio;Gallo, Gaetano;Trompetto, Mario;Ferrero, Giulio;Mizutani, Sayaka;Shiroma, Hirotsugu;Shiba, Satoshi;Shibata, Tatsuhiro;Yachida, Shinichi;Yamada, Takuji;Wirbel, Jakob;Schrotz-King, Petra;Ulrich, Cornelia M;Brenner, Hermann;Arumugam, Manimozhiyan;Bork, Peer;Zeller, Georg;Cordero, Francesca;Dias-Neto, Emmanuel;Setubal, João Carlos;Tett, Adrian;Pardini, Barbara;Rescigno, Maria;Waldron, Levi;Naccarati, Alessio;Segata, Nicola"

30911134,2019,Nature medicine,Immune signature drives leukemia escape and relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation.,"Transplantation of hematopoietic cells from a healthy individual (allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)) demonstrates that adoptive immunotherapy can cure blood cancers: still, post-transplantation relapses remain frequent. To explain their drivers, we analyzed the genomic and gene expression profiles of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts purified from patients at serial time-points during their disease history. We identified a transcriptional signature specific for post-transplantation relapses and highly enriched in immune-related processes, including T cell costimulation and antigen presentation. In two independent patient cohorts we confirmed the deregulation of multiple costimulatory ligands on AML blasts at post-transplantation relapse (PD-L1, B7-H3, CD80, PVRL2), mirrored by concomitant changes in circulating donor T cells. Likewise, we documented the frequent loss of surface expression of HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP on leukemia cells, due to downregulation of the HLA class II regulator CIITA. We show that loss of HLA class II expression and upregulation of inhibitory checkpoint molecules represent alternative modalities to abolish AML recognition from donor-derived T cells, and can be counteracted by interferon-γ or checkpoint blockade, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the deregulation of pathways involved in T cell-mediated allorecognition is a distinctive feature and driver of AML relapses after allo-HCT, which can be rapidly translated into personalized therapies.","Toffalori, Cristina;Zito, Laura;Gambacorta, Valentina;Riba, Michela;Oliveira, Giacomo;Bucci, Gabriele;Barcella, Matteo;Spinelli, Orietta;Greco, Raffaella;Crucitti, Lara;Cieri, Nicoletta;Noviello, Maddalena;Manfredi, Francesco;Montaldo, Elisa;Ostuni, Renato;Naldini, Matteo M;Gentner, Bernhard;Waterhouse, Miguel;Zeiser, Robert;Finke, Jurgen;Hanoun, Maher;Beelen, Dietrich W;Gojo, Ivana;Luznik, Leo;Onozawa, Masahiro;Teshima, Takanori;Devillier, Raynier;Blaise, Didier;Halkes, Constantijn J M;Griffioen, Marieke;Carrabba, Matteo G;Bernardi, Massimo;Peccatori, Jacopo;Barlassina, Cristina;Stupka, Elia;Lazarevic, Dejan;Tonon, Giovanni;Rambaldi, Alessandro;Cittaro, Davide;Bonini, Chiara;Fleischhauer, Katharina;Ciceri, Fabio;Vago, Luca"

Evidence now suggests that these microbes may confer susceptibility to certain cancers and may also influence response to therapeutics. A prime example of this is seen with immunotherapy, for which gut microbes have been implicated in influencing therapeutic responses in preclinical models and patient cohorts. However, these microbes may influence responses to other forms of therapy as well and may also affect treatment-associated toxicity. Based on these influences, there is growing interest in targeting these microbes in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Yet complexities exist, and a deeper understanding of host-microbiome interactions is critical to realization of the full potential of such approaches.

30842677,2019,Nature medicine,Genomic correlates of response to immune checkpoint blockade.,"Despite impressive durable responses, immune checkpoint inhibitors do not provide a long-term benefit to the majority of patients with cancer. Understanding genomic correlates of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade may enhance benefits for patients with cancer by elucidating biomarkers for patient stratification and resistance mechanisms for therapeutic targeting. Here we review emerging genomic markers of checkpoint blockade response, including those related to neoantigens, antigen presentation, DNA repair, and oncogenic pathways. Compelling evidence also points to a role for T cell functionality, checkpoint regulators, chromatin modifiers, and copy-number alterations in mediating selective response to immune checkpoint blockade. Ultimately, efforts to contextualize genomic correlates of response into the larger understanding of tumor immune biology will build a foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and therapies to overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade.","Keenan, Tanya E;Burke, Kelly P;Van Allen, Eliezer M"

Childhood cancers exhibit a lower overall mutational burden than adult cancers, and recent sequencing studies have revealed that the genomic events central to childhood oncogenesis include mutations resulting in broad epigenetic changes or translocations that result in fusion oncoproteins. Here, we will review the developmental origins of childhood cancers, epigenetic dysregulation in tissue stem/precursor cells in numerous examples of childhood cancer oncogenesis and emerging therapeutic opportunities aimed at both cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental targets together with new insights into the mechanisms underlying long-term sequelae of childhood cancer therapy.","Filbin, Mariella;Monje, Michelle"

We show that, to our surprise, suppression of KRAS increased autophagic flux, as did pharmacological inhibition of its effector ERK MAPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that either KRAS suppression or ERK inhibition decreased both glycolytic and mitochondrial functions. We speculated that ERK inhibition might thus enhance PDAC dependence on autophagy, in part by impairing other KRAS- or ERK-driven metabolic processes. Accordingly, we found that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of specific autophagy regulators synergistically enhanced the ability of ERK inhibitors to mediate antitumor activity in KRAS-driven PDAC. We conclude that combinations of pharmacologic inhibitors that concurrently block both ERK MAPK and autophagic processes that are upregulated in response to ERK inhibition may be effective treatments for PDAC.","Bryant, Kirsten L;Stalnecker, Clint A;Zeitouni, Daniel;Klomp, Jennifer E;Peng, Sen;Tikunov, Andrey P;Gunda, Venugopal;Pierobon, Mariaelena;Waters, Andrew M;George, Samuel D;Tomar, Garima;Papke, Björn;Hobbs, G Aaron;Yan, Liang;Hayes, Tikvah K;Diehl, J Nathaniel;Goode, Gennifer D;Chaika, Nina V;Wang, Yingxue;Zhang, Guo-Fang;Witkiewicz, Agnieszka K;Knudsen, Erik S;Petricoin, Emanuel F;Singh, Pankaj K;Macdonald, Jeffrey M;Tran, Nhan L;Lyssiotis, Costas A;Ying, Haoqiang;Kimmelman, Alec C;Cox, Adrienne D;Der, Channing J"

While only expressed on some myeloid cells normally, Siglec-15 is broadly upregulated on human cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, and its expression is mutually exclusive to B7-H1, partially due to its induction by macrophage colony-stimulating factor and downregulation by IFN-γ. We demonstrate that Siglec-15 suppresses antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Genetic ablation or antibody blockade of Siglec-15 amplifies anti-tumor immunity in the TME and inhibits tumor growth in some mouse models. Taken together, our results support Siglec-15 as a potential target for normalization cancer immunotherapy.","Wang, Jun;Sun, Jingwei;Liu, Linda N;Flies, Dallas B;Nie, Xinxin;Toki, Maria;Zhang, Jianping;Song, Chang;Zarr, Melissa;Zhou, Xu;Han, Xue;Archer, Kristina A;O'Neill, Thomas;Herbst, Roy S;Boto, Agedi N;Sanmamed, Miguel F;Langermann, Solomon;Rimm, David L;Chen, Lieping"

30804515,2019,Nature medicine,A single dose of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade predicts clinical outcomes in resectable melanoma.,"Immunologic responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients occur rapidly with pharmacodynamic T cell responses detectable in blood by 3 weeks. It is unclear, however, whether these early blood-based observations translate to the tumor microenvironment. We conducted a study of neoadjuvant/adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in stage III/IV melanoma. We hypothesized that immune reinvigoration in the tumor would be detectable at 3 weeks and that this response would correlate with disease-free survival. We identified a rapid and potent anti-tumor response, with 8 of 27 patients experiencing a complete or major pathological response after a single dose of anti-PD-1, all of whom remain disease free. These rapid pathologic and clinical responses were associated with accumulation of exhausted CD8 T cells in the tumor at 3 weeks, with reinvigoration in the blood observed as early as 1 week. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated a pretreatment immune signature (neoadjuvant response signature) that was associated with clinical benefit. In contrast, patients with disease recurrence displayed mechanisms of resistance including immune suppression, mutational escape, and/or tumor evolution. Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment is effective in high-risk resectable stage III/IV melanoma. Pathological response and immunological analyses after a single neoadjuvant dose can be used to predict clinical outcome and to dissect underlying mechanisms in checkpoint blockade.","Huang, Alexander C;Orlowski, Robert J;Xu, Xiaowei;Mick, Rosemarie;George, Sangeeth M;Yan, Patrick K;Manne, Sasikanth;Kraya, Adam A;Wubbenhorst, Bradley;Dorfman, Liza;D'Andrea, Kurt;Wenz, Brandon M;Liu, Shujing;Chilukuri, Lakshmi;Kozlov, Andrew;Carberry, Mary;Giles, Lydia;Kier, Melanie W;Quagliarello, Felix;McGettigan, Suzanne;Kreider, Kristin;Annamalai, Lakshmanan;Zhao, Qing;Mogg, Robin;Xu, Wei;Blumenschein, Wendy M;Yearley, Jennifer H;Linette, Gerald P;Amaravadi, Ravi K;Schuchter, Lynn M;Herati, Ramin S;Bengsch, Bertram;Nathanson, Katherine L;Farwell, Michael D;Karakousis, Giorgos C;Wherry, E John;Mitchell, Tara C"
30742122,2019,Nature medicine,Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy promotes a survival benefit with intratumoral and systemic immune responses in recurrent glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor survival. The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival following neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in 35 patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Patients who were randomized to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, with continued adjuvant therapy following surgery, had significantly extended overall survival compared to patients that were randomized to receive adjuvant, post-surgical programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade alone. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cell- and interferon-γ-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell-cycle-related gene expression within the tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. Focal induction of programmed death-ligand 1 in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced clonal expansion of T cells, decreased PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T cells and a decreasing monocytic population was observed more frequently in the neoadjuvant group than in patients treated only in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that the neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances both the local and systemic antitumor immune response and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor.","Cloughesy, Timothy F;Mochizuki, Aaron Y;Orpilla, Joey R;Hugo, Willy;Lee, Alexander H;Davidson, Tom B;Wang, Anthony C;Ellingson, Benjamin M;Rytlewski, Julie A;Sanders, Catherine M;Kawaguchi, Eric S;Du, Lin;Li, Gang;Yong, William H;Gaffey, Sarah C;Cohen, Adam L;Mellinghoff, Ingo K;Lee, Eudocia Q;Reardon, David A;O'Brien, Barbara J;Butowski, Nicholas A;Nghiemphu, Phioanh L;Clarke, Jennifer L;Arrillaga-Romany, Isabel C;Colman, Howard;Kaley, Thomas J;de Groot, John F;Liau, Linda M;Wen, Patrick Y;Prins, Robert M"

To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles.

Humoral immunity contributes to the progression of certain cancers, but the roles of B cells and their derived antibodies in premetastatic niche formation are poorly defined. Using a mouse model of spontaneous lymph node metastasis of breast cancer, we show that primary tumors induced B cell accumulation in draining lymph nodes. These B cells selectively promoted lymph node metastasis by producing pathogenic IgG that targeted glycosylated membrane protein HSPA4, and activated the HSPA4-binding protein ITGB5 and the downstream Src/NF-κB pathway in tumor cells for CXCR4/SDF1α-axis-mediated metastasis. High serum anti-HSPA4 IgG was correlated with high tumor HSPA4 expression and poor prognosis of breast cancer subjects.

30531922,2019,Nature medicine,The molecular landscape of glioma in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome in which glioma is one of the prevalent tumors. Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations. Thus, the profiling of NF1-glioma defined a distinct landscape that recapitulates a subset of sporadic tumors.","D'Angelo, Fulvio;Ceccarelli, Michele;Garofano, Luciano;Zhang, Jing;Frattini, Véronique;Caruso, Francesca P;Lewis, Genevieve;Alfaro, Kristin D;Bauchet, Luc;Berzero, Giulia;Cachia, David;Cangiano, Mario;Capelle, Laurent;de Groot, John;DiMeco, Francesco;Ducray, François;Farah, Walid;Finocchiaro, Gaetano;Goutagny, Stéphane;Kamiya-Matsuoka, Carlos;Lavarino, Cinzia;Loiseau, Hugues;Lorgis, Véronique;Marras, Carlo E;McCutcheon, Ian;Nam, Do-Hyun;Ronchi, Susanna;Saletti, Veronica;Seizeur, Romuald;Slopis, John;Suñol, Mariona;Vandenbos, Fanny;Varlet, Pascale;Vidaud, Dominique;Watts, Colin;Tabar, Viviane;Reuss, David E;Kim, Seung-Ki;Meyronet, David;Mokhtari, Karima;Salvador, Hector;Bhat, Krishna P;Eoli, Marica;Sanson, Marc;Lasorella, Anna;Iavarone, Antonio"

30510255,2019,Nature medicine,Myelodysplastic syndrome progression to acute myeloid leukemia at the stem cell level.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) frequently progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the cells leading to malignant transformation have not been directly elucidated. As progression of MDS to AML in humans provides a biological system to determine the cellular origins and mechanisms of neoplastic transformation, we studied highly fractionated stem cell populations in longitudinal samples of patients with MDS who progressed to AML. Targeted deep sequencing combined with single-cell sequencing of sorted cell populations revealed that stem cells at the MDS stage, including immunophenotypically and functionally defined pre-MDS stem cells (pre-MDS-SC), had a significantly higher subclonal complexity compared to blast cells and contained a large number of aging-related variants. Single-cell targeted resequencing of highly fractionated stem cells revealed a pattern of nonlinear, parallel clonal evolution, with distinct subclones within pre-MDS-SC and MDS-SC contributing to generation of MDS blasts or progression to AML, respectively. Furthermore, phenotypically aberrant stem cell clones expanded during transformation and stem cell subclones that were not detectable in MDS blasts became dominant upon AML progression. These results reveal a crucial role of diverse stem cell compartments during MDS progression to AML and have implications for current bulk cell-focused precision oncology approaches, both in MDS and possibly other cancers that evolve from premalignant conditions, that may miss pre-existing rare aberrant stem cells that drive disease progression and leukemic transformation.","Chen, Jiahao;Kao, Yun-Ruei;Sun, Daqian;Todorova, Tihomira I;Reynolds, David;Narayanagari, Swathi-Rao;Montagna, Cristina;Will, Britta;Verma, Amit;Steidl, Ulrich"

Here we show that the expression of WASP and WIP is frequently low or absent in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) compared to other T cell lymphomas. In anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) ALCL, WASP and WIP expression is regulated by ALK oncogenic activity via its downstream mediators STAT3 and C/EBP-β. ALK+ lymphomas were accelerated in WASP- and WIP-deficient mice. In the absence of WASP, active GTP-bound CDC42 was increased and the genetic deletion of one CDC42 allele was sufficient to impair lymphoma growth. WASP-deficient lymphoma showed increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation that could be exploited as a therapeutic vulnerability. Our findings demonstrate that WASP and WIP are tumor suppressors in T cell lymphoma and suggest that MAP-kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors combined with ALK inhibitors could achieve a more potent therapeutic effect in ALK+ ALCL.","Menotti, Matteo;Ambrogio, Chiara;Cheong, Taek-Chin;Pighi, Chiara;Mota, Ines;Cassel, Seth H;Compagno, Mara;Wang, Qi;Dall'Olio, Riccardo;Minero, Valerio G;Poggio, Teresa;Sharma, Geeta Geeta;Patrucco, Enrico;Mastini, Cristina;Choudhari, Ramesh;Pich, Achille;Zamo, Alberto;Piva, Roberto;Giliani, Silvia;Mologni, Luca;Collings, Clayton K;Kadoch, Cigall;Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo;Notarangelo, Luigi D;Anton, Ines M;Voena, Claudia;Chiarle, Roberto"

30478424,2019,Nature medicine,Aurora kinase A drives the evolution of resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer.,"Although targeted therapies often elicit profound initial patient responses, these effects are transient due to residual disease leading to acquired resistance. How tumors transition between drug responsiveness, tolerance and resistance, especially in the absence of preexisting subclones, remains unclear. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells, we demonstrate that residual disease and acquired resistance in response to EGFR inhibitors requires Aurora kinase A (AURKA) activity. Nongenetic resistance through the activation of AURKA by its coactivator TPX2 emerges in response to chronic EGFR inhibition where it mitigates drug-induced apoptosis. Aurora kinase inhibitors suppress this adaptive survival program, increasing the magnitude and duration of EGFR inhibitor response in preclinical models. Treatment-induced activation of AURKA is associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in vitro, in vivo and in most individuals with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. These findings delineate a molecular path whereby drug resistance emerges from drug-tolerant cells and unveils a synthetic lethal strategy for enhancing responses to EGFR inhibitors by suppressing AURKA-driven residual disease and acquired resistance.","Shah, Khyati N;Bhatt, Roma;Rotow, Julia;Rohrberg, Julia;Olivas, Victor;Wang, Victoria E;Hemmati, Golzar;Martins, Maria M;Maynard, Ashley;Kuhn, Jonathan;Galeas, Jacqueline;Donnella, Hayley J;Kaushik, Swati;Ku, Angel;Dumont, Sophie;Krings, Gregor;Haringsma, Henry J;Robillard, Liliane;Simmons, Andrew D;Harding, Thomas C;McCormick, Frank;Goga, Andrei;Blakely, Collin M;Bivona, Trever G;Bandyopadhyay, Sourav"

Here we identify the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) as a master regulator of AR networks in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). OC2 acts as a survival factor in mCRPC models, suppresses the AR transcriptional program by direct regulation of AR target genes and the AR licensing factor FOXA1, and activates genes associated with neural differentiation and progression to lethal disease. OC2 appears active in a substantial subset of human prostate adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Inhibition of OC2 by a newly identified small molecule suppresses metastasis in mice.

Circulating tumor DNA analysis revealed that these alterations could be dynamically monitored, providing concurrent information on treatment response and tumor evolution. Functional modeling demonstrated that compromise of the SWI-SNF complex facilitated transcriptional upregulation of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) providing a selective advantage against ibrutinib plus venetoclax.

30374200,2018,Nature medicine,Translational control of tumor immune escape via the eIF4F-STAT1-PD-L1 axis in melanoma.,"Preventing the immune escape of tumor cells by blocking inhibitory checkpoints, such as the interaction between programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, is a powerful anticancer approach. However, many patients do not respond to checkpoint blockade. Tumor PD-L1 expression is a potential efficacy biomarker, but the complex mechanisms underlying its regulation are not completely understood. Here, we show that the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, eIF4F, which binds the 5' cap of mRNAs, regulates the surface expression of interferon-γ-induced PD-L1 on cancer cells by regulating translation of the mRNA encoding the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factor. eIF4F complex formation correlates with response to immunotherapy in human melanoma. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A, the RNA helicase component of eIF4F, elicits powerful antitumor immune-mediated effects via PD-L1 downregulation. Thus, eIF4A inhibitors, in development as anticancer drugs, may also act as cancer immunotherapies.","Cerezo, Michaël;Guemiri, Ramdane;Druillennec, Sabine;Girault, Isabelle;Malka-Mahieu, Hélène;Shen, Shensi;Allard, Delphine;Martineau, Sylvain;Welsch, Caroline;Agoussi, Sandrine;Estrada, Charlène;Adam, Julien;Libenciuc, Cristina;Routier, Emilie;Roy, Séverine;Désaubry, Laurent;Eggermont, Alexander M;Sonenberg, Nahum;Scoazec, Jean Yves;Eychène, Alain;Vagner, Stéphan;Robert, Caroline"

Genomic studies have provided insights into molecular subgroups and oncogenic drivers of pediatric brain tumors that may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. To evaluate new treatments, better preclinical models adequately reflecting the biological heterogeneity are needed. Through the Children's Oncology Group ACNS02B3 study, we have generated and comprehensively characterized 30 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models and seven cell lines representing 14 molecular subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. Patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models were found to be representative of the human tumors they were derived from in terms of histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression, DNA methylation, copy number, and mutational profiles. In vivo drug sensitivity of targeted therapeutics was associated with distinct molecular tumor subgroups and specific genetic alterations.

30224758,2018,Nature medicine,Transcriptional addiction in cancer cells is mediated by YAP/TAZ through BRD4.,"Cancer cells rely on dysregulated gene expression. This establishes specific transcriptional addictions that may be therapeutically exploited. Yet, the mechanisms that are ultimately responsible for these addictions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the transcriptional dependencies of transformed cells to the transcription factors YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ physically engage the general coactivator bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), dictating the genome-wide association of BRD4 to chromatin. YAP/TAZ flag a large set of enhancers with super-enhancer-like functional properties. YAP/TAZ-bound enhancers mediate the recruitment of BRD4 and RNA polymerase II at YAP/TAZ-regulated promoters, boosting the expression of a host of growth-regulating genes. Treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of BRD4 blunts YAP/TAZ pro-tumorigenic activity in several cell or tissue contexts, causes the regression of pre-established, YAP/TAZ-addicted neoplastic lesions and reverts drug resistance. This work sheds light on essential mediators, mechanisms and genome-wide regulatory elements that are responsible for transcriptional addiction in cancer and lays the groundwork for a rational use of BET inhibitors according to YAP/TAZ biology.","Zanconato, Francesca;Battilana, Giusy;Forcato, Mattia;Filippi, Letizia;Azzolin, Luca;Manfrin, Andrea;Quaranta, Erika;Di Biagio, Daniele;Sigismondo, Gianluca;Guzzardo, Vincenza;Lejeune, Pascale;Haendler, Bernard;Krijgsveld, Jeroen;Fassan, Matteo;Bicciato, Silvio;Cordenonsi, Michelangelo;Piccolo, Stefano"
30224757,2018,Nature medicine,Classification and mutation prediction from non-small cell lung cancer histopathology images using deep learning.,"Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them-STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53-can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations.

Here, we present genome-scale maps of DNA methylation in matched primary and recurring glioblastoma tumors, using data from a highly annotated clinical cohort that was selected through a national patient registry. We demonstrate the feasibility of DNA methylation mapping in a large set of routinely collected FFPE samples, and we validate bisulfite sequencing as a multipurpose assay that allowed us to infer a range of different genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional characteristics of the profiled tumor samples. On the basis of these data, we identified subtle differences between primary and recurring tumors, links between DNA methylation and the tumor microenvironment, and an association of epigenetic tumor heterogeneity with patient survival. In summary, this study establishes an open resource for dissecting DNA methylation heterogeneity in a genetically diverse and heterogeneous cancer, and it demonstrates the feasibility of integrating epigenomics, radiology, and digital pathology for a national cohort, thereby leveraging existing samples and data collected as part of routine clinical practice.","Klughammer, Johanna;Kiesel, Barbara;Roetzer, Thomas;Fortelny, Nikolaus;Nemc, Amelie;Nenning, Karl-Heinz;Furtner, Julia;Sheffield, Nathan C;Datlinger, Paul;Peter, Nadine;Nowosielski, Martha;Augustin, Marco;Mischkulnig, Mario;Ströbel, Thomas;Alpar, Donat;Ergüner, Bekir;Senekowitsch, Martin;Moser, Patrizia;Freyschlag, Christian F;Kerschbaumer, Johannes;Thomé, Claudius;Grams, Astrid E;Stockhammer, Günther;Kitzwoegerer, Melitta;Oberndorfer, Stefan;Marhold, Franz;Weis, Serge;Trenkler, Johannes;Buchroithner, Johanna;Pichler, Josef;Haybaeck, Johannes;Krassnig, Stefanie;Mahdy Ali, Kariem;von Campe, Gord;Payer, Franz;Sherif, Camillo;Preiser, Julius;Hauser, Thomas;Winkler, Peter A;Kleindienst, Waltraud;Würtz, Franz;Brandner-Kokalj, Tanisa;Stultschnig, Martin;Schweiger, Stefan;Dieckmann, Karin;Preusser, Matthias;Langs, Georg;Baumann, Bernhard;Knosp, Engelbert;Widhalm, Georg;Marosi, Christine;Hainfellner, Johannes A;Woehrer, Adelheid;Bock, Christoph"
30127394,2018,Nature medicine,Robust prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in metastatic melanoma.,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy provides remarkable clinical gains and has been very successful in treatment of melanoma. However, only a subset of patients with advanced tumors currently benefit from ICB therapies, which at times incur considerable side effects and costs. Constructing predictors of patient response has remained a serious challenge because of the complexity of the immune response and the shortage of large cohorts of ICB-treated patients that include both 'omics' and response data. Here we build immuno-predictive score (IMPRES), a predictor of ICB response in melanoma which encompasses 15 pairwise transcriptomics relations between immune checkpoint genes. It is based on two key conjectures: (i) immune mechanisms underlying spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma can predict melanoma response to ICB, and (ii) key immune interactions can be captured via specific pairwise relations of the expression of immune checkpoint genes.

We identified signatures of T cell dysfunction from large tumor cohorts by testing how the expression of each gene in tumors interacts with the CTL infiltration level to influence patient survival. We also modeled factors that exclude T cell infiltration into tumors using expression signatures from immunosuppressive cells. Using this framework and pre-treatment RNA-Seq or NanoString tumor expression profiles, TIDE predicted the outcome of melanoma patients treated with first-line anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 more accurately than other biomarkers such as PD-L1 level and mutation load. TIDE also revealed new candidate ICB resistance regulators, such as SERPINB9, demonstrating utility for immunotherapy research.","Jiang, Peng;Gu, Shengqing;Pan, Deng;Fu, Jingxin;Sahu, Avinash;Hu, Xihao;Li, Ziyi;Traugh, Nicole;Bu, Xia;Li, Bo;Liu, Jun;Freeman, Gordon J;Brown, Myles A;Wucherpfennig, Kai W;Liu, X Shirley"
30127391,2018,Nature medicine,Genetically engineered human cortical spheroid models of tuberous sclerosis.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem developmental disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose protein products are negative regulators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling. Hallmark pathologies of TSC are cortical tubers-regions of dysmorphic, disorganized neurons and glia in the cortex that are linked to epileptogenesis. To determine the developmental origin of tuber cells, we established human cellular models of TSC by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing of TSC1 or TSC2 in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Using heterozygous TSC2 hPSCs with a conditional mutation in the functional allele, we show that mosaic biallelic inactivation during neural progenitor expansion is necessary for the formation of dysplastic cells and increased glia production in three-dimensional cortical spheroids. Our findings provide support for the second-hit model of cortical tuber formation and suggest that variable developmental timing of somatic mutations could contribute to the heterogeneity in the neurological presentation of TSC.","Blair, John D;Hockemeyer, Dirk;Bateup, Helen S"
30104766,2018,Nature medicine,Sequestration of T cells in bone marrow in the setting of glioblastoma and other intracranial tumors.,"T cell dysfunction contributes to tumor immune escape in patients with cancer and is particularly severe amidst glioblastoma (GBM). Among other defects, T cell lymphopenia is characteristic, yet often attributed to treatment. We reveal that even treatment-naïve subjects and mice with GBM can harbor AIDS-level CD4 counts, as well as contracted, T cell-deficient lymphoid organs. Missing naïve T cells are instead found sequestered in large numbers in the bone marrow. This phenomenon characterizes not only GBM but a variety of other cancers, although only when tumors are introduced into the intracranial compartment. T cell sequestration is accompanied by tumor-imposed loss of S1P1 from the T cell surface and is reversible upon precluding S1P1 internalization. In murine models of GBM, hindering S1P1 internalization and reversing sequestration licenses T cell-activating therapies that were previously ineffective. Sequestration of T cells in bone marrow is therefore a tumor-adaptive mode of T cell dysfunction, whose reversal may constitute a promising immunotherapeutic adjunct.","Chongsathidkiet, Pakawat;Jackson, Christina;Koyama, Shohei;Loebel, Franziska;Cui, Xiuyu;Farber, S Harrison;Woroniecka, Karolina;Elsamadicy, Aladine A;Dechant, Cosette A;Kemeny, Hanna R;Sanchez-Perez, Luis;Cheema, Tooba A;Souders, Nicholas C;Herndon, James E;Coumans, Jean-Valery;Everitt, Jeffrey I;Nahed, Brian V;Sampson, John H;Gunn, Michael D;Martuza, Robert L;Dranoff, Glenn;Curry, William T;Fecci, Peter E"

PD-L1 testing is required for checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in front-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, obtaining adequate tumor tissue for molecular testing in patients with advanced disease can be challenging. Thus, an unmet medical need exists for diagnostic approaches that do not require tissue to identify patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Here, we describe a novel, technically robust, blood-based assay to measure TMB in plasma (bTMB) that is distinct from tissue-based approaches. Using a retrospective analysis of two large randomized trials as test and validation studies, we show that bTMB reproducibly identifies patients who derive clinically significant improvements in progression-free survival from atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1) in second-line and higher NSCLC.

30038221,2018,Nature medicine,Oncogenic hijacking of the stress response machinery in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Cellular transformation is accompanied by extensive rewiring of many biological processes leading to augmented levels of distinct types of cellular stress, including proteotoxic stress. Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition. Our data demonstrate an integral crosstalk between mediators of oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and reveal critical nodes of the heat shock response pathway that can be targeted therapeutically.","Kourtis, Nikos;Lazaris, Charalampos;Hockemeyer, Kathryn;Balandrán, Juan Carlos;Jimenez, Alejandra R;Mullenders, Jasper;Gong, Yixiao;Trimarchi, Thomas;Bhatt, Kamala;Hu, Hai;Shrestha, Liza;Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto;Kelliher, Michelle;Paietta, Elisabeth;Chiosis, Gabriela;Guzman, Monica L;Ferrando, Adolfo A;Tsirigos, Aristotelis;Aifantis, Iannis"

30038216,2018,Nature medicine,Enhancer mapping uncovers phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in patients with luminal breast cancer.,"The degree of intrinsic and interpatient phenotypic heterogeneity and its role in tumor evolution is poorly understood. Phenotypic drifts can be transmitted via inheritable transcriptional programs. Cell-type specific transcription is maintained through the activation of epigenetically defined regulatory regions including promoters and enhancers. Here we have annotated the epigenome of 47 primary and metastatic estrogen-receptor (ERα)-positive breast cancer clinical specimens and inferred phenotypic heterogeneity from the regulatory landscape, identifying key regulatory elements commonly shared across patients. Shared regions contain a unique set of regulatory information including the motif for transcription factor YY1. We identify YY1 as a critical determinant of ERα transcriptional activity promoting tumor growth in most luminal patients. YY1 also contributes to the expression of genes mediating resistance to endocrine treatment. Finally, we used H3K27ac levels at active enhancer elements as a surrogate of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity to track the expansion and contraction of phenotypic subpopulations throughout breast cancer progression. By tracking the clonality of SLC9A3R1-positive cells, a bona fide YY1-ERα-regulated gene, we show that endocrine therapies select for phenotypic clones under-represented at diagnosis.

30013198,2018,Nature medicine,Clonal heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia treated with the IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib.,"Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) occur in several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In model systems, mutant IDH2 causes hematopoietic differentiation arrest. Enasidenib, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2, produces a clinical response in 40% of treated patients with relapsed/refractory AML by promoting leukemic cell differentiation. Here, we studied the clonal basis of response and acquired resistance to enasidenib treatment. Using sequential patient samples, we determined the clonal structure of hematopoietic cell populations at different stages of differentiation. Before therapy, IDH2-mutant clones showed variable differentiation arrest. Enasidenib treatment promoted hematopoietic differentiation from either terminal or ancestral mutant clones; less frequently, treatment promoted differentiation of nonmutant cells. Analysis of paired diagnosis/relapse samples did not identify second-site mutations in IDH2 at relapse. Instead, relapse arose by clonal evolution or selection of terminal or ancestral clones, thus highlighting multiple bypass pathways that could potentially be targeted to restore differentiation arrest. These results show how mapping of clonal structure in cell populations at different stages of differentiation can reveal the response and evolution of clones during treatment response and relapse.","Quek, Lynn;David, Muriel D;Kennedy, Alison;Metzner, Marlen;Amatangelo, Michael;Shih, Alan;Stoilova, Bilyana;Quivoron, Cyril;Heiblig, Maël;Willekens, Christophe;Saada, Véronique;Alsafadi, Samar;Vijayabaskar, M S;Peniket, Andy;Bernard, Oliver A;Agresta, Sam;Yen, Katharine;MacBeth, Kyle;Stein, Eytan;Vassiliou, George S;Levine, Ross;De Botton, Stephane;Thakurta, Anjan;Penard-Lacronique, Virginie;Vyas, Paresh"

With the goal of identifying determinants of response, we performed molecular characterization of tissues and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from 61 patients with mGC who were treated with pembrolizumab as salvage treatment in a prospective phase 2 clinical trial. In patients with microsatellite instability-high and Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumors, which are mutually exclusive, dramatic responses to pembrolizumab were observed (overall response rate (ORR) 85.7% in microsatellite instability-high mGC and ORR 100% in Epstein-Barr virus-positive mGC). For the 55 patients for whom programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score positivity was available (combined positive score cut-off value ≥1%), ORR was significantly higher in PD-L1(+) gastric cancer when compared to PD-L1(-) tumors (50.0% versus 0.0%, P value <0.001). Changes in ctDNA levels at six weeks post-treatment predicted response and progression-free survival, and decreased ctDNA was associated with improved outcomes. Our findings provide insight into the molecular features associated with response to pembrolizumab in patients with mGC and provide biomarkers potentially relevant for the selection of patients who may derive greater benefit from PD-1 inhibition.","Kim, Seung Tae;Cristescu, Razvan;Bass, Adam J;Kim, Kyoung-Mee;Odegaard, Justin I;Kim, Kyung;Liu, Xiao Qiao;Sher, Xinwei;Jung, Hun;Lee, Mijin;Lee, Sujin;Park, Se Hoon;Park, Joon Oh;Park, Young Suk;Lim, Ho Yeong;Lee, Hyuk;Choi, Mingew;Talasaz, AmirAli;Kang, Peter Soonmo;Cheng, Jonathan;Loboda, Andrey;Lee, Jeeyun;Kang, Won Ki"

However, the premalignant mutational landscape of AML and its impact on risk and time to diagnosis is unknown. Here we identified 212 women from the Women's Health Initiative who were healthy at study baseline, but eventually developed AML during follow-up (median time: 9.6 years). Deep sequencing was performed on peripheral blood DNA of these cases and compared to age-matched controls that did not develop AML. We discovered that mutations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, DNMT3A, TET2 and spliceosome genes significantly increased the odds of developing AML. All subjects with TP53 mutations (n = 21 out of 21 patients) and IDH1 and IDH2 (n = 15 out of 15 patients) mutations eventually developed AML in our study. The presence of detectable mutations years before diagnosis suggests that there is a period of latency that precedes AML during which early detection, monitoring and interventional studies should be considered.","Desai, Pinkal;Mencia-Trinchant, Nuria;Savenkov, Oleksandr;Simon, Michael S;Cheang, Gloria;Lee, Sangmin;Samuel, Michael;Ritchie, Ellen K;Guzman, Monica L;Ballman, Karla V;Roboz, Gail J;Hassane, Duane C"
29988129,2018,Nature medicine,Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment.,"Cancer cells are embedded in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem of stromal cells. Here, we present a 52,698-cell catalog of the TME transcriptome in human lung tumors at single-cell resolution, validated in independent samples where 40,250 additional cells were sequenced. By comparing with matching non-malignant lung samples, we reveal a highly complex TME that profoundly molds stromal cells. We identify 52 stromal cell subtypes, including novel subpopulations in cell types hitherto considered to be homogeneous, as well as transcription factors underlying their heterogeneity. For instance, we discover fibroblasts expressing different collagen sets, endothelial cells downregulating immune cell homing and genes coregulated with established immune checkpoint transcripts and correlating with T-cell activity. By assessing marker genes for these cell subtypes in bulk RNA-sequencing data from 1,572 patients, we illustrate how these correlate with survival, while immunohistochemistry for selected markers validates them as separate cellular entities in an independent series of lung tumors. Hence, in providing a comprehensive catalog of stromal cells types and by characterizing their phenotype and co-optive behavior, this resource provides deeper insights into lung cancer biology that will be helpful in advancing lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.","Lambrechts, Diether;Wauters, Els;Boeckx, Bram;Aibar, Sara;Nittner, David;Burton, Oliver;Bassez, Ayse;Decaluwé, Herbert;Pircher, Andreas;Van den Eynde, Kathleen;Weynand, Birgit;Verbeken, Erik;De Leyn, Paul;Liston, Adrian;Vansteenkiste, Johan;Carmeliet, Peter;Aerts, Stein;Thienpont, Bernard"
29967352,2018,Nature medicine,Functional diversity and cooperativity between subclonal populations of pediatric glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma cells.,"The failure to develop effective therapies for pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is in part due to their intrinsic heterogeneity. We aimed to quantitatively assess the extent to which this was present in these tumors through subclonal genomic analyses and to determine whether distinct tumor subpopulations may interact to promote tumorigenesis by generating subclonal patient-derived models in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of 142 sequenced tumors revealed multiple tumor subclones, spatially and temporally coexisting in a stable manner as observed by multiple sampling strategies. We isolated genotypically and phenotypically distinct subpopulations that we propose cooperate to enhance tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy. Inactivating mutations in the H4K20 histone methyltransferase KMT5B (SUV420H1), present in <1% of cells, abrogate DNA repair and confer increased invasion and migration on neighboring cells, in vitro and in vivo, through chemokine signaling and modulation of integrins. These data indicate that even rare tumor subpopulations may exert profound effects on tumorigenesis as a whole and may represent a new avenue for therapeutic development. Unraveling the mechanisms of subclonal diversity and communication in pGBM and DIPG will be an important step toward overcoming barriers to effective treatments.","Vinci, Mara;Burford, Anna;Molinari, Valeria;Kessler, Ketty;Popov, Sergey;Clarke, Matthew;Taylor, Kathryn R;Pemberton, Helen N;Lord, Christopher J;Gutteridge, Alice;Forshew, Tim;Carvalho, Diana;Marshall, Lynley V;Qin, Elizabeth Y;Ingram, Wendy J;Moore, Andrew S;Ng, Ho-Keung;Trabelsi, Saoussen;H'mida-Ben Brahim, Dorra;Entz-Werle, Natacha;Zacharoulis, Stergios;Vaidya, Sucheta;Mandeville, Henry C;Bridges, Leslie R;Martin, Andrew J;Al-Sarraj, Safa;Chandler, Christopher;Sunol, Mariona;Mora, Jaume;de Torres, Carmen;Cruz, Ofelia;Carcaboso, Angel M;Monje, Michelle;Mackay, Alan;Jones, Chris"

29892070,2018,Nature medicine,An inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation exploits cancer vulnerability.,"Metabolic reprograming is an emerging hallmark of tumor biology and an actively pursued opportunity in discovery of oncology drugs. Extensive efforts have focused on therapeutic targeting of glycolysis, whereas drugging mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has remained largely unexplored, partly owing to an incomplete understanding of tumor contexts in which OXPHOS is essential. Here, we report the discovery of IACS-010759, a clinical-grade small-molecule inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Treatment with IACS-010759 robustly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in models of brain cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reliant on OXPHOS, likely owing to a combination of energy depletion and reduced aspartate production that leads to impaired nucleotide biosynthesis. In models of brain cancer and AML, tumor growth was potently inhibited in vivo following IACS-010759 treatment at well-tolerated doses. IACS-010759 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials in relapsed/refractory AML and solid tumors.","Molina, Jennifer R;Sun, Yuting;Protopopova, Marina;Gera, Sonal;Bandi, Madhavi;Bristow, Christopher;McAfoos, Timothy;Morlacchi, Pietro;Ackroyd, Jeffrey;Agip, Ahmed-Noor A;Al-Atrash, Gheath;Asara, John;Bardenhagen, Jennifer;Carrillo, Caroline C;Carroll, Christopher;Chang, Edward;Ciurea, Stefan;Cross, Jason B;Czako, Barbara;Deem, Angela;Daver, Naval;de Groot, John Frederick;Dong, Jian-Wen;Feng, Ningping;Gao, Guang;Gay, Jason;Do, Mary Geck;Greer, Jennifer;Giuliani, Virginia;Han, Jing;Han, Lina;Henry, Verlene K;Hirst, Judy;Huang, Sha;Jiang, Yongying;Kang, Zhijun;Khor, Tin;Konoplev, Sergej;Lin, Yu-Hsi;Liu, Gang;Lodi, Alessia;Lofton, Timothy;Ma, Helen;Mahendra, Mikhila;Matre, Polina;Mullinax, Robert;Peoples, Michael;Petrocchi, Alessia;Rodriguez-Canale, Jaime;Serreli, Riccardo;Shi, Thomas;Smith, Melinda;Tabe, Yoko;Theroff, Jay;Tiziani, Stefano;Xu, Quanyun;Zhang, Qi;Muller, Florian;DePinho, Ronald A;Toniatti, Carlo;Draetta, Giulio F;Heffernan, Timothy P;Konopleva, Marina;Jones, Philip;Di Francesco, M Emilia;Marszalek, Joseph R"
29892069,2018,Nature medicine,STAT3 labels a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes required for brain metastasis.,"The brain microenvironment imposes a particularly intense selective pressure on metastasis-initiating cells, but successful metastases bypass this control through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Reactive astrocytes are key components of this microenvironment that confine brain metastasis without infiltrating the lesion. Here, we describe that brain metastatic cells induce and maintain the co-option of a pro-metastatic program driven by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes surrounding metastatic lesions. These reactive astrocytes benefit metastatic cells by their modulatory effect on the innate and acquired immune system. In patients, active STAT3 in reactive astrocytes correlates with reduced survival from diagnosis of intracranial metastases. Blocking STAT3 signaling in reactive astrocytes reduces experimental brain metastasis from different primary tumor sources, even at advanced stages of colonization. We also show that a safe and orally bioavailable treatment that inhibits STAT3 exhibits significant antitumor effects in patients with advanced systemic disease that included brain metastasis. Responses to this therapy were notable in the central nervous system, where several complete responses were achieved. Given that brain metastasis causes substantial morbidity and mortality, our results identify a novel treatment for increasing survival in patients with secondary brain tumors.","Priego, Neibla;Zhu, Lucía;Monteiro, Cátia;Mulders, Manon;Wasilewski, David;Bindeman, Wendy;Doglio, Laura;Martínez, Liliana;Martínez-Saez, Elena;Ramón Y Cajal, Santiago;Megías, Diego;Hernández-Encinas, Elena;Blanco-Aparicio, Carmen;Martínez, Lola;Zarzuela, Eduardo;Muñoz, Javier;Fustero-Torre, Coral;Piñeiro-Yáñez, Elena;Hernández-Laín, Aurelio;Bertero, Luca;Poli, Valeria;Sanchez-Martinez, Melchor;Menendez, Javier A;Soffietti, Riccardo;Bosch-Barrera, Joaquim;Valiente, Manuel"

29892061,2018,Nature medicine,Mutations in the SWI/SNF complex induce a targetable dependence on oxidative phosphorylation in lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is a devastating disease that remains a top cause of cancer mortality. Despite improvements with targeted and immunotherapies, the majority of patients with lung cancer lack effective therapies, underscoring the need for additional treatment approaches. Genomic studies have identified frequent alterations in components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex including SMARCA4 and ARID1A. To understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis driven by mutations in this complex, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma by ablating Smarca4 in the lung epithelium. We demonstrate that Smarca4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor and cooperates with p53 loss and Kras activation. Gene expression analyses revealed the signature of enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in SMARCA4 mutant tumors. We further show that SMARCA4 mutant cells have enhanced oxygen consumption and increased respiratory capacity. Importantly, SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors have marked sensitivity to inhibition of OXPHOS by a novel small molecule, IACS-010759, that is under clinical development. Mechanistically, we show that SMARCA4-deficient cells have a blunted transcriptional response to energy stress creating a therapeutically exploitable synthetic lethal interaction. These findings provide the mechanistic basis for further development of OXPHOS inhibitors as therapeutics against SWI/SNF mutant tumors.","Lissanu Deribe, Yonathan;Sun, Yuting;Terranova, Christopher;Khan, Fatima;Martinez-Ledesma, Juan;Gay, Jason;Gao, Guang;Mullinax, Robert A;Khor, Tin;Feng, Ningping;Lin, Yu-Hsi;Wu, Chia-Chin;Reyes, Claudia;Peng, Qian;Robinson, Frederick;Inoue, Akira;Kochat, Veena;Liu, Chang-Gong;Asara, John M;Moran, Cesar;Muller, Florian;Wang, Jing;Fang, Bingliang;Papadimitrakopoulou, Vali;Wistuba, Ignacio I;Rai, Kunal;Marszalek, Joseph;Futreal, P Andrew"
29875463,2018,Nature medicine,Metastatic cancers promote cachexia through ZIP14 upregulation in skeletal muscle.,"Patients with metastatic cancer experience a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function known as cachexia. Cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and accelerated death in patients with cancer, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the metal-ion transporter ZRT- and IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14) as a critical mediator of cancer-induced cachexia. ZIP14 is upregulated in cachectic muscles of mice and in patients with metastatic cancer and can be induced by TNF-α and TGF-β cytokines. Strikingly, germline ablation or muscle-specific depletion of Zip14 markedly reduces muscle atrophy in metastatic cancer models. We find that ZIP14-mediated zinc uptake in muscle progenitor cells represses the expression of MyoD and Mef2c and blocks muscle-cell differentiation. Importantly, ZIP14-mediated zinc accumulation in differentiated muscle cells induces myosin heavy chain loss. These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for altered zinc homeostasis in metastatic cancer-induced muscle wasting and implicate ZIP14 as a therapeutic target for its treatment.","Wang, Gang;Biswas, Anup K;Ma, Wanchao;Kandpal, Manoj;Coker, Courtney;Grandgenett, Paul M;Hollingsworth, Michael A;Jain, Rinku;Tanji, Kurenai;Lόpez-Pintado, Sara;Borczuk, Alain;Hebert, Doreen;Jenkitkasemwong, Supak;Hojyo, Shintaro;Davuluri, Ramana V;Knutson, Mitchell D;Fukada, Toshiyuki;Acharyya, Swarnali"

Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in intent-to-treat and PD-L1+ populations. Intent-to-treat PFS hazard ratios for atezolizumab + bevacizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy versus sunitinib were 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-1.45) and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.82-1.71), respectively; PD-L1+ PFS hazard ratios were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.38-1.08) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.63-1.67), respectively. Exploratory biomarker analyses indicated that tumor mutation and neoantigen burden were not associated with PFS. Angiogenesis, T-effector/IFN-γ response, and myeloid inflammatory gene expression signatures were strongly and differentially associated with PFS within and across the treatments.

Here, we analyze the reference epigenome of seven primary CLLs and the regulatory chromatin landscape of 107 primary cases in the context of normal B cell differentiation. We identify that the CLL chromatin landscape is largely influenced by distinct dynamics during normal B cell maturation. Beyond this, we define extensive catalogues of regulatory elements de novo reprogrammed in CLL as a whole and in its major clinico-biological subtypes classified by IGHV somatic hypermutation levels. We uncover that IGHV-unmutated CLLs harbor more active and open chromatin than IGHV-mutated cases. Furthermore, we show that de novo active regions in CLL are enriched for NFAT, FOX and TCF/LEF transcription factor family binding sites. Although most genetic alterations are not associated with consistent epigenetic profiles, CLLs with MYD88 mutations and trisomy 12 show distinct chromatin configurations. Furthermore, we observe that non-coding mutations in IGHV-mutated CLLs are enriched in H3K27ac-associated regulatory elements outside accessible chromatin. Overall, this study provides an integrative portrait of the CLL epigenome, identifies extensive networks of altered regulatory elements and sheds light on the relationship between the genetic and epigenetic architecture of the disease.","Beekman, Renée;Chapaprieta, Vicente;Russiñol, Núria;Vilarrasa-Blasi, Roser;Verdaguer-Dot, Núria;Martens, Joost H A;Duran-Ferrer, Martí;Kulis, Marta;Serra, François;Javierre, Biola M;Wingett, Steven W;Clot, Guillem;Queirós, Ana C;Castellano, Giancarlo;Blanc, Julie;Gut, Marta;Merkel, Angelika;Heath, Simon;Vlasova, Anna;Ullrich, Sebastian;Palumbo, Emilio;Enjuanes, Anna;Martín-García, David;Beà, Sílvia;Pinyol, Magda;Aymerich, Marta;Royo, Romina;Puiggros, Montserrat;Torrents, David;Datta, Avik;Lowy, Ernesto;Kostadima, Myrto;Roller, Maša;Clarke, Laura;Flicek, Paul;Agirre, Xabier;Prosper, Felipe;Baumann, Tycho;Delgado, Julio;López-Guillermo, Armando;Fraser, Peter;Yaspo, Marie-Laure;Guigó, Roderic;Siebert, Reiner;Martí-Renom, Marc A;Puente, Xose S;López-Otín, Carlos;Gut, Ivo;Stunnenberg, Hendrik G;Campo, Elias;Martin-Subero, Jose I"
29760445,2018,Nature medicine,Elevated prenatal anti-Müllerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the main cause of female infertility worldwide and corresponds with a high degree of comorbidities and economic burden. How PCOS is passed on from one generation to the next is not clear, but it may be a developmental condition. Most women with PCOS exhibit higher levels of circulating luteinizing hormone, suggestive of heightened gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as compared to healthy women. Excess AMH in utero may affect the development of the female fetus. However, as AMH levels drop during pregnancy in women with normal fertility, it was unclear whether their levels were also elevated in pregnant women with PCOS. Here we measured AMH in a cohort of pregnant women with PCOS and control pregnant women and found that AMH is significantly more elevated in the former group versus the latter. To determine whether the elevation of AMH during pregnancy in women with PCOS is a bystander effect or a driver of the condition in the offspring, we modeled our clinical findings by treating pregnant mice with AMH and followed the neuroendocrine phenotype of their female progeny postnatally. This treatment resulted in maternal neuroendocrine-driven testosterone excess and diminished placental metabolism of testosterone to estradiol, resulting in a masculinization of the exposed female fetus and a PCOS-like reproductive and neuroendocrine phenotype in adulthood. We found that the affected females had persistently hyperactivated GnRH neurons and that GnRH antagonist treatment in the adult female offspring restored their neuroendocrine phenotype to a normal state. These findings highlight a critical role for excess prenatal AMH exposure and subsequent aberrant GnRH receptor signaling in the neuroendocrine dysfunctions of PCOS, while offering a new potential therapeutic avenue to treat the condition during adulthood.","Tata, Brooke;Mimouni, Nour El Houda;Barbotin, Anne-Laure;Malone, Samuel A;Loyens, Anne;Pigny, Pascal;Dewailly, Didier;Catteau-Jonard, Sophie;Sundström-Poromaa, Inger;Piltonen, Terhi T;Dal Bello, Federica;Medana, Claudio;Prevot, Vincent;Clasadonte, Jerome;Giacobini, Paolo"

29713087,2018,Nature medicine,Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes.,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease that is further classified into transcriptionally defined activated B cell (ABC) and germinal center B cell (GCB) subtypes. We carried out a comprehensive genetic analysis of 304 primary DLBCLs and identified low-frequency alterations, captured recurrent mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants, and defined coordinate signatures in patients with available outcome data. We integrated these genetic drivers using consensus clustering and identified five robust DLBCL subsets, including a previously unrecognized group of low-risk ABC-DLBCLs of extrafollicular/marginal zone origin; two distinct subsets of GCB-DLBCLs with different outcomes and targetable alterations; and an ABC/GCB-independent group with biallelic inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A loss, and associated genomic instability. The genetic features of the newly characterized subsets, their mutational signatures, and the temporal ordering of identified alterations provide new insights into DLBCL pathogenesis.

29713086,2018,Nature medicine,Carboplatin in BRCA1/2-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial.,"Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 predispose individuals to breast cancer (termed germline-mutated BRCA1/2 breast cancer, gBRCA-BC) by impairing homologous recombination (HR) and causing genomic instability. HR also repairs DNA lesions caused by platinum agents and PARP inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) harbor subpopulations with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesized to be especially platinum-sensitive. Cancers in putative 'BRCAness' subgroups-tumors with BRCA1 methylation; low levels of BRCA1 mRNA (BRCA1 mRNA-low); or mutational signatures for HR deficiency and those with basal phenotypes-may also be sensitive to platinum. We assessed the efficacy of carboplatin and another mechanistically distinct therapy, docetaxel, in a phase 3 trial in subjects with unselected advanced TNBC. A prespecified protocol enabled biomarker-treatment interaction analyses in gBRCA-BC and BRCAness subgroups. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). In the unselected population (376 subjects; 188 carboplatin, 188 docetaxel), carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% versus 34.0%, respectively; P = 0.66). In contrast, in subjects with gBRCA-BC, carboplatin had double the ORR of docetaxel (68% versus 33%, respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction P = 0.01). Such benefit was not observed for subjects with BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors or a high score in a Myriad HRD assay. Significant interaction between treatment and the basal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response in the nonbasal subgroup. We conclude that patients with advanced TNBC benefit from characterization of BRCA1/2 mutations, but not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRD analyses, to inform choices on platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, gene expression analysis of basal-like cancers may also influence treatment selection.","Tutt, Andrew;Tovey, Holly;Cheang, Maggie Chon U;Kernaghan, Sarah;Kilburn, Lucy;Gazinska, Patrycja;Owen, Julie;Abraham, Jacinta;Barrett, Sophie;Barrett-Lee, Peter;Brown, Robert;Chan, Stephen;Dowsett, Mitchell;Flanagan, James M;Fox, Lisa;Grigoriadis, Anita;Gutin, Alexander;Harper-Wynne, Catherine;Hatton, Matthew Q;Hoadley, Katherine A;Parikh, Jyoti;Parker, Peter;Perou, Charles M;Roylance, Rebecca;Shah, Vandna;Shaw, Adam;Smith, Ian E;Timms, Kirsten M;Wardley, Andrew M;Wilson, Gregory;Gillett, Cheryl;Lanchbury, Jerry S;Ashworth, Alan;Rahman, Nazneen;Harries, Mark;Ellis, Paul;Pinder, Sarah E;Bliss, Judith M"

29686424,2018,Nature medicine,Mechanisms and clinical activity of an EGFR and HER2 exon 20-selective kinase inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Although most activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a subset with alterations in exon 20 of EGFR and HER2 are intrinsically resistant and lack an effective therapy. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon 20 mutations and to identify effective inhibitors. 3D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug-binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. We found that poziotinib, owing to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR TKIs in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC.

29578538,2018,Nature medicine,Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer diagnosed in more than 200,000 women each year and is recalcitrant to targeted therapies. Although TNBCs harbor multiple hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RTK inhibitors have been largely ineffective in TNBC patients thus far. We developed a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC that is based on combined inhibition of receptors that share the negative regulator PTPN12. Previously, we and others identified the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 as a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in TNBC. PTPN12 restrains several RTKs, suggesting that PTPN12 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of multiple RTKs and a co-dependency on these receptors. This in turn leads to the therapeutic hypothesis that PTPN12-deficient TNBCs may be responsive to combined RTK inhibition. However, the repertoire of RTKs that are restrained by PTPN12 in human cells has not been systematically explored. By methodically identifying the suite of RTK substrates (MET, PDGFRβ, EGFR, and others) inhibited by PTPN12, we rationalized a combination RTK-inhibitor therapy that induced potent tumor regression across heterogeneous models of TNBC. Orthogonal approaches revealed that PTPN12 was recruited to and inhibited these receptors after ligand stimulation, thereby serving as a feedback mechanism to limit receptor signaling. Cancer-associated mutation of PTPN12 or reduced PTPN12 protein levels diminished this feedback mechanism, leading to aberrant activity of these receptors. Restoring PTPN12 protein levels restrained signaling from RTKs, including PDGFRβ and MET, and impaired TNBC survival. In contrast with single agents, combined inhibitors targeting the PDGFRβ and MET receptors induced the apoptosis in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic strategy resulted in tumor regressions in chemo-refractory patient-derived TNBC models. Notably, response correlated with PTPN12 deficiency, suggesting that impaired receptor feedback may establish a combined addiction to these proto-oncogenic receptors. Taken together, our data provide a rationale for combining RTK inhibitors in TNBC and other malignancies that lack receptor-activating mutations.","Nair, Amritha;Chung, Hsiang-Ching;Sun, Tingting;Tyagi, Siddhartha;Dobrolecki, Lacey E;Dominguez-Vidana, Rocio;Kurley, Sarah J;Orellana, Mayra;Renwick, Alexander;Henke, David M;Katsonis, Panagiotis;Schmitt, Earlene;Chan, Doug W;Li, Hui;Mao, Sufeng;Petrovic, Ivana;Creighton, Chad J;Gutierrez, Carolina;Dubrulle, Julien;Stossi, Fabio;Tyner, Jeffrey W;Lichtarge, Olivier;Lin, Charles Y;Zhang, Bing;Scott, Kenneth L;Hilsenbeck, Susan G;Sun, Jinpeng;Yu, Xiao;Osborne, C Kent;Schiff, Rachel;Christensen, James G;Shields, David J;Rimawi, Mothaffar F;Ellis, Matthew J;Shaw, Chad A;Lewis, Michael T;Westbrook, Thomas F"
29529015,2018,Nature medicine,Microenvironmental control of breast cancer subtype elicited through paracrine platelet-derived growth factor-CC signaling.,"Breast tumors of the basal-like, hormone receptor-negative subtype remain an unmet clinical challenge, as there is high rate of recurrence and poor survival in patients following treatment. Coevolution of the malignant mammary epithelium and its underlying stroma instigates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to support most, if not all, hallmarks of cancer progression. Here we delineate a previously unappreciated role for CAFs as determinants of the molecular subtype of breast cancer. We identified paracrine crosstalk between cancer cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-CC and CAFs expressing the cognate receptors in human basal-like mammary carcinomas. Genetic or pharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity in mouse models of cancer resulted in conversion of basal-like breast cancers into a hormone receptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy in previously resistant tumors. We conclude that specification of breast cancer to the basal-like subtype is under microenvironmental control and is therapeutically actionable.","Roswall, Pernilla;Bocci, Matteo;Bartoschek, Michael;Li, Hong;Kristiansen, Glen;Jansson, Sara;Lehn, Sophie;Sjölund, Jonas;Reid, Steven;Larsson, Christer;Eriksson, Pontus;Anderberg, Charlotte;Cortez, Eliane;Saal, Lao H;Orsmark-Pietras, Christina;Cordero, Eugenia;Haller, Bengt Kristian;Häkkinen, Jari;Burvenich, Ingrid J G;Lim, Elgene;Orimo, Akira;Höglund, Mattias;Rydén, Lisa;Moch, Holger;Scott, Andrew M;Eriksson, Ulf;Pietras, Kristian"
29505034,2018,Nature medicine,Bone marrow niche trafficking of miR-126 controls the self-renewal of leukemia stem cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (hereafter referred to as CML LSCs) are responsible for initiating and maintaining clonal hematopoiesis. These cells persist in the bone marrow (BM) despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here we show that although the microRNA (miRNA) miR-126 supported the quiescence, self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs, miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from healthy individuals. Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 (SPRED1) by BCR-ABL, which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that mediates miRNA maturation. Endothelial cells (ECs) in the BM supply miR-126 to CML LSCs to support quiescence and leukemia growth, as shown using mouse models of CML in which Mir126a (encoding miR-126) was conditionally knocked out in ECs and/or LSCs. Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase in endogenous miR-126 levels, which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence. Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs, or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs, enhanced the in vivo anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC leukemia-initiating capacity, providing a new strategy for the elimination of LSCs in individuals with CML.","Zhang, Bin;Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong;Li, Ling;Zhao, Dandan;Kumar, Bijender;Wu, Herman;Lin, Allen;Pellicano, Francesca;Hopcroft, Lisa;Su, Yu-Lin;Copland, Mhairi;Holyoake, Tessa L;Kuo, Calvin J;Bhatia, Ravi;Snyder, David S;Ali, Haris;Stein, Anthony S;Brewer, Casey;Wang, Huafeng;McDonald, Tinisha;Swiderski, Piotr;Troadec, Estelle;Chen, Ching-Cheng;Dorrance, Adrienne;Pullarkat, Vinod;Yuan, Yate-Ching;Perrotti, Danilo;Carlesso, Nadia;Forman, Stephen J;Kortylewski, Marcin;Kuo, Ya-Huei;Marcucci, Guido"
29505033,2018,Nature medicine,SHP2 inhibition restores sensitivity in ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer resistant to ALK inhibitors.,"Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung tumors initially respond to small-molecule ALK inhibitors, but drug resistance often develops. Of tumors that develop resistance to highly potent second-generation ALK inhibitors, approximately half harbor resistance mutations in ALK, while the other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance. Members of the latter group often have activation of at least one of several different tyrosine kinases driving resistance. Such tumors are not expected to respond to lorlatinib-a third-generation inhibitor targeting ALK that is able to overcome all clinically identified resistant mutations in ALK-and further therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we deployed a shRNA screen of 1,000 genes in multiple ALK-inhibitor-resistant patient-derived cells (PDCs) to discover those that confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. This approach identified SHP2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a common targetable resistance node in multiple PDCs. SHP2 provides a parallel survival input downstream of multiple tyrosine kinases that promote resistance to ALK inhibitors. Treatment with SHP099, the recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of SHP2, in combination with the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ceritinib halted the growth of resistant PDCs through preventing compensatory RAS and ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) reactivation. These findings suggest that combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for resistant cancers driven by several different ALK-independent mechanisms underlying resistance.","Dardaei, Leila;Wang, Hui Qin;Singh, Manrose;Fordjour, Paul;Shaw, Katherine X;Yoda, Satoshi;Kerr, Grainne;Yu, Kristine;Liang, Jinsheng;Cao, Yichen;Chen, Yan;Lawrence, Michael S;Langenbucher, Adam;Gainor, Justin F;Friboulet, Luc;Dagogo-Jack, Ibiayi;Myers, David T;Labrot, Emma;Ruddy, David;Parks, Melissa;Lee, Dana;DiCecca, Richard H;Moody, Susan;Hao, Huaixiang;Mohseni, Morvarid;LaMarche, Matthew;Williams, Juliet;Hoffmaster, Keith;Caponigro, Giordano;Shaw, Alice T;Hata, Aaron N;Benes, Cyril H;Li, Fang;Engelman, Jeffrey A"
29505032,2018,Nature medicine,Single-cell developmental classification of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis reveals predictors of relapse.,"Insight into the cancer cell populations that are responsible for relapsed disease is needed to improve outcomes. Here we report a single-cell-based study of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis that reveals hidden developmentally dependent cell signaling states that are uniquely associated with relapse. By using mass cytometry we simultaneously quantified 35 proteins involved in B cell development in 60 primary diagnostic samples. Each leukemia cell was then matched to its nearest healthy B cell population by a developmental classifier that operated at the single-cell level. Machine learning identified six features of expanded leukemic populations that were sufficient to predict patient relapse at diagnosis. These features implicated the pro-BII subpopulation of B cells with activated mTOR signaling, and the pre-BI subpopulation of B cells with activated and unresponsive pre-B cell receptor signaling, to be associated with relapse. This model, termed 'developmentally dependent predictor of relapse' (DDPR), significantly improves currently established risk stratification methods. DDPR features exist at diagnosis and persist at relapse. By leveraging a data-driven approach, we demonstrate the predictive value of single-cell 'omics' for patient stratification in a translational setting and provide a framework for its application to human cancer.","Good, Zinaida;Sarno, Jolanda;Jager, Astraea;Samusik, Nikolay;Aghaeepour, Nima;Simonds, Erin F;White, Leah;Lacayo, Norman J;Fantl, Wendy J;Fazio, Grazia;Gaipa, Giuseppe;Biondi, Andrea;Tibshirani, Robert;Bendall, Sean C;Nolan, Garry P;Davis, Kara L"
29457796,2018,Nature medicine,"H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, induces lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers.","Genomic analyses of cancer have identified recurrent point mutations in the RNA splicing factor-encoding genes SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 that confer an alteration of function. Cancer cells bearing these mutations are preferentially dependent on wild-type (WT) spliceosome function, but clinically relevant means to therapeutically target the spliceosome do not currently exist. Here we describe an orally available modulator of the SF3b complex, H3B-8800, which potently and preferentially kills spliceosome-mutant epithelial and hematologic tumor cells. These killing effects of H3B-8800 are due to its direct interaction with the SF3b complex, as evidenced by loss of H3B-8800 activity in drug-resistant cells bearing mutations in genes encoding SF3b components. Although H3B-8800 modulates WT and mutant spliceosome activity, the preferential killing of spliceosome-mutant cells is due to retention of short, GC-rich introns, which are enriched for genes encoding spliceosome components. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of splicing modulation in spliceosome-mutant cancers.","Seiler, Michael;Yoshimi, Akihide;Darman, Rachel;Chan, Betty;Keaney, Gregg;Thomas, Michael;Agrawal, Anant A;Caleb, Benjamin;Csibi, Alfredo;Sean, Eckley;Fekkes, Peter;Karr, Craig;Klimek, Virginia;Lai, George;Lee, Linda;Kumar, Pavan;Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei;Liu, Xiang;Mackenzie, Crystal;Meeske, Carol;Mizui, Yoshiharu;Padron, Eric;Park, Eunice;Pazolli, Ermira;Peng, Shouyong;Prajapati, Sudeep;Taylor, Justin;Teng, Teng;Wang, John;Warmuth, Markus;Yao, Huilan;Yu, Lihua;Zhu, Ping;Abdel-Wahab, Omar;Smith, Peter G;Buonamici, Silvia"

29400712,2018,Nature medicine,Noncanonical hedgehog pathway activation through SRF-MKL1 promotes drug resistance in basal cell carcinomas.,"Hedgehog pathway-dependent cancers can escape Smoothened (SMO) inhibition through mutations in genes encoding canonical hedgehog pathway components; however, around 50% of drug-resistant basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) lack additional variants of these genes. Here we use multidimensional genomics analysis of human and mouse drug-resistant BCCs to identify a noncanonical hedgehog activation pathway driven by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Active SRF along with its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) binds DNA near hedgehog target genes and forms a previously unknown protein complex with the hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 (GLI1), causing amplification of GLI1 transcriptional activity. We show that cytoskeletal activation through Rho and the formin family member Diaphanous (mDia) is required for SRF-MKL-driven GLI1 activation and for tumor cell viability. Remarkably, nuclear MKL1 staining served as a biomarker in tumors from mice and human subjects to predict tumor responsiveness to MKL inhibitors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. Thus, our study illuminates, for the first time, cytoskeletal-activation-driven transcription as a personalized therapeutic target for combatting drug-resistant malignancies.","Whitson, Ramon J;Lee, Alex;Urman, Nicole M;Mirza, Amar;Yao, Catherine Y;Brown, Alexander S;Li, Jiang R;Shankar, Gautam;Fry, Micah A;Atwood, Scott X;Lee, Eunice Y;Hollmig, S Tyler;Aasi, Sumaira Z;Sarin, Kavita Y;Scott, Matthew P;Epstein, Ervin H;Tang, Jean Y;Oro, Anthony E"
29400710,2018,Nature medicine,A novel chimeric antigen receptor containing a JAK-STAT signaling domain mediates superior antitumor effects.,"The adoptive transfer of T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) (hereafter referred to as CAR-T cells) specific for the B lymphocyte antigen CD19 has shown impressive clinical responses in patients with refractory B cell malignancies. However, the therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells that target other malignancies have not yet resulted in significant clinical benefit. Although inefficient tumor trafficking and various immunosuppressive mechanisms can impede CAR-T cell effector responses, the signals delivered by the current CAR constructs may still be insufficient to fully activate antitumor T cell functions. Optimal T cell activation and proliferation requires multiple signals, including T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2) and cytokine engagement (signal 3). However, CAR constructs currently being tested in the clinic contain a CD3z (TCR signaling) domain and co-stimulatory domain(s) but not a domain that transmits signal 3 (refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). Here we have developed a novel CAR construct capable of inducing cytokine signaling after antigen stimulation. This new-generation CD19 CAR encodes a truncated cytoplasmic domain from the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor β-chain (IL-2Rβ) and a STAT3-binding tyrosine-X-X-glutamine (YXXQ) motif, together with the TCR signaling (CD3z) and co-stimulatory (CD28) domains (hereafter referred to as 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ)). The 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T cells showed antigen-dependent activation of the JAK kinase and of the STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors signaling pathways, which promoted their proliferation and prevented terminal differentiation in vitro. The 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T cells demonstrated superior in vivo persistence and antitumor effects in models of liquid and solid tumors as compared with CAR-T cells expressing a CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain alone. Taken together, these results suggest that our new-generation CAR has the potential to demonstrate superior antitumor effects with minimal toxicity in the clinic and that clinical translation of this novel CAR is warranted.","Kagoya, Yuki;Tanaka, Shinya;Guo, Tingxi;Anczurowski, Mark;Wang, Chung-Hsi;Saso, Kayoko;Butler, Marcus O;Minden, Mark D;Hirano, Naoto"
29334376,2018,Nature medicine,Positively selected enhancer elements endow osteosarcoma cells with metastatic competence.,"Metastasis results from a complex set of traits acquired by tumor cells, distinct from those necessary for tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the contribution of enhancer elements to the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma. Through epigenomic profiling, we identify substantial differences in enhancer activity between primary and metastatic human tumors and between near isogenic pairs of highly lung metastatic and nonmetastatic osteosarcoma cell lines. We term these regions metastatic variant enhancer loci (Met-VELs). Met-VELs drive coordinated waves of gene expression during metastatic colonization of the lung. Met-VELs cluster nonrandomly in the genome, indicating that activity of these enhancers and expression of their associated gene targets are positively selected. As evidence of this causal association, osteosarcoma lung metastasis is inhibited by global interruptions of Met-VEL-associated gene expression via pharmacologic BET inhibition, by knockdown of AP-1 transcription factors that occupy Met-VELs, and by knockdown or functional inhibition of individual genes activated by Met-VELs, such as that encoding coagulation factor III/tissue factor (F3). We further show that genetic deletion of a single Met-VEL at the F3 locus blocks metastatic cell outgrowth in the lung. These findings indicate that Met-VELs and the genes they regulate play a functional role in metastasis and may be suitable targets for antimetastatic therapies.","Morrow, James J;Bayles, Ian;Funnell, Alister P W;Miller, Tyler E;Saiakhova, Alina;Lizardo, Michael M;Bartels, Cynthia F;Kapteijn, Maaike Y;Hung, Stevephen;Mendoza, Arnulfo;Dhillon, Gursimran;Chee, Daniel R;Myers, Jay T;Allen, Frederick;Gambarotti, Marco;Righi, Alberto;DiFeo, Analisa;Rubin, Brian P;Huang, Alex Y;Meltzer, Paul S;Helman, Lee J;Picci, Piero;Versteeg, Henri H;Stamatoyannopoulos, John A;Khanna, Chand;Scacheri, Peter C"

29334371,2018,Nature medicine,Cooperative targeting of melanoma heterogeneity with an AXL antibody-drug conjugate and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.,"Intratumor heterogeneity is a key factor contributing to therapeutic failure and, hence, cancer lethality. Heterogeneous tumors show partial therapy responses, allowing for the emergence of drug-resistant clones that often express high levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. In melanoma, AXL-high cells are resistant to MAPK pathway inhibitors, whereas AXL-low cells are sensitive to these inhibitors, rationalizing a differential therapeutic approach. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate, AXL-107-MMAE, comprising a human AXL antibody linked to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E. We found that AXL-107-MMAE, as a single agent, displayed potent in vivo anti-tumor activity in patient-derived xenografts, including melanoma, lung, pancreas and cervical cancer. By eliminating distinct populations in heterogeneous melanoma cell pools, AXL-107-MMAE and MAPK pathway inhibitors cooperatively inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, by inducing AXL transcription, BRAF/MEK inhibitors potentiated the efficacy of AXL-107-MMAE. These findings provide proof of concept for the premise that rationalized combinatorial targeting of distinct populations in heterogeneous tumors may improve therapeutic effect, and merit clinical validation of AXL-107-MMAE in both treatment-naive and drug-resistant cancers in mono- or combination therapy.","Boshuizen, Julia;Koopman, Louise A;Krijgsman, Oscar;Shahrabi, Aida;van den Heuvel, Elke Gresnigt-;Ligtenberg, Maarten A;Vredevoogd, David W;Kemper, Kristel;Kuilman, Thomas;Song, Ji-Ying;Pencheva, Nora;Mortensen, Jens Thing;Foppen, Marnix Geukes;Rozeman, Elisa A;Blank, Christian U;Janmaat, Maarten L;Satijn, David;Breij, Esther C W;Peeper, Daniel S;Parren, Paul W H I"

Here, we characterized the immune-cell composition of prostate cancers driven by the loss of the critical tumor suppressor gene Pten, either alone or in combination with the loss of Trp53, Zbtb7a or Pml. We observed a striking quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity that was directly dependent on the specific genetic events in the tumor and ranged from 'cold', noninflamed tumors to massively infiltrated landscapes-results with important therapeutic implications.

29291352,2018,Nature medicine,Recurrent ECSIT mutation encoding V140A triggers hyperinflammation and promotes hemophagocytic syndrome in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.,"Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a fatal hyperinflammatory disease with a poorly understood mechanism that occurs most frequently in extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Through exome sequencing of ENKTL tumor-normal samples, we have identified a hotspot mutation (c.419T>C) in the evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT) gene, encoding a V140A variant of ECSIT. ECSIT-V140A activated NF-κB more potently than the wild-type protein owing to its increased affinity for the S100A8 and S100A9 heterodimer, which promotes NADPH oxidase activity. ECSIT-T419C knock-in mice showed higher peritoneal NADPH oxidase activity than mice with wild-type ECSIT in response to LPS. ECSIT-T419C-transfected ENKTL cell lines produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ, which induced macrophage activation and massive cytokine secretion in cell culture and mouse xenografts. In individuals with ENKTL, ECSIT-V140A was associated with activation of NF-κB, higher HPS incidence, and poor prognosis. The immunosuppressive drug thalidomide prevented NF-κB from binding to the promoters of its target genes (including TNF and IFNG), and combination treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone extended survival of mice engrafted with ECSIT-T419C-transfected ENKTL cells. We added thalidomide to the conventional dexamethasone-containing therapy regimen for two patients with HPS who expressed ECSIT-V140A, and we observed reversal of their HPS and disease-free survival for longer than 3 years. These findings provide mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for ENKTL-associated HPS.","Wen, Haijun;Ma, Huajuan;Cai, Qichun;Lin, Suxia;Lei, Xinxing;He, Bin;Wu, Sijin;Wang, Zifeng;Gao, Yan;Liu, Wensheng;Liu, Weiping;Tao, Qian;Long, Zijie;Yan, Min;Li, Dali;Kelley, Keith W;Yang, Yongliang;Huang, Huiqiang;Liu, Quentin"
29227476,2018,Nature medicine,The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions.,"We present the molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and characterize nearly 1,000 participants in Children's Oncology Group (COG) AML trials. The COG-National Cancer Institute (NCI) TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA and microRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants corresponded to diverse, infrequent mutations, with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2% of cases. In contrast, somatic structural variants, including new gene fusions and focal deletions of MBNL1, ZEB2 and ELF1, were disproportionately prevalent in young individuals as compared to adults. Conversely, mutations in DNMT3A and TP53, which were common in adults, were conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. New mutations in GATA2, FLT3 and CBL and recurrent mutations in MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS and WT1 were frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations and promoter DNA hypermethylation convergently impacted Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell interactions and a cluster of zinc finger-encoding genes associated with KMT2A rearrangements. These results highlight the need for and facilitate the development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric AML.","Bolouri, Hamid;Farrar, Jason E;Triche, Timothy;Ries, Rhonda E;Lim, Emilia L;Alonzo, Todd A;Ma, Yussanne;Moore, Richard;Mungall, Andrew J;Marra, Marco A;Zhang, Jinghui;Ma, Xiaotu;Liu, Yu;Liu, Yanling;Auvil, Jaime M Guidry;Davidsen, Tanja M;Gesuwan, Patee;Hermida, Leandro C;Salhia, Bodour;Capone, Stephen;Ramsingh, Giridharan;Zwaan, Christian Michel;Noort, Sanne;Piccolo, Stephen R;Kolb, E Anders;Gamis, Alan S;Smith, Malcolm A;Gerhard, Daniela S;Meshinchi, Soheil"

We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease.","Broutier, Laura;Mastrogiovanni, Gianmarco;Verstegen, Monique Ma;Francies, Hayley E;Gavarró, Lena Morrill;Bradshaw, Charles R;Allen, George E;Arnes-Benito, Robert;Sidorova, Olga;Gaspersz, Marcia P;Georgakopoulos, Nikitas;Koo, Bon-Kyoung;Dietmann, Sabine;Davies, Susan E;Praseedom, Raaj K;Lieshout, Ruby;IJzermans, Jan N M;Wigmore, Stephen J;Saeb-Parsy, Kourosh;Garnett, Mathew J;van der Laan, Luc Jw;Huch, Meritxell"

Here, we demonstrate that these histological features are associated with distinct transcriptional programs, with vascular regions showing a proneural profile, and hypoxic regions showing a mesenchymal pattern. As these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress due to downregulation of the E3 ligase RNF144A. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that proneural GSCs are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas mesenchymal GSCs are more sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both proneural and mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be effective in overcoming therapy resistance caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.","Jin, Xun;Kim, Leo J Y;Wu, Qiulian;Wallace, Lisa C;Prager, Briana C;Sanvoranart, Tanwarat;Gimple, Ryan C;Wang, Xiuxing;Mack, Stephen C;Miller, Tyler E;Huang, Ping;Valentim, Claudia L;Zhou, Qi-Gang;Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill S;Bao, Shideng;Sloan, Andrew E;Rich, Jeremy N"

It has gradually become clear that many tumors harbor CSCs in dedicated niches, and yet their identification and eradication has not been as obvious as was initially hoped. Recently developed lineage-tracing and cell-ablation strategies have provided insights into CSC plasticity, quiescence, renewal, and therapeutic response.

Expectations in the field have become more realistic, and now, the first successes of therapies based on the CSC concept are emerging.","Batlle, Eduard;Clevers, Hans"
28967920,2017,Nature medicine,Keap1 loss promotes Kras-driven lung cancer and results in dependence on glutaminolysis.,"Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in cancer treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the KRAS oncoprotein. One approach to addressing this challenge is to define mutations that frequently co-occur with those in KRAS, which themselves may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene encoding Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (refs. 2, 3, 4), a negative regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. The high frequency of mutations in KEAP1 suggests an important role for the oxidative stress response in lung tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach in a mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD, we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer progression. We show that loss of Keap1 hyperactivates NRF2 and promotes KRAS-driven LUAD in mice. Through a combination of CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic analyses, we show that Keap1- or Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased glutaminolysis, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we provide a rationale for stratification of human patients with lung cancer harboring KRAS/KEAP1- or KRAS/NRF2-mutant lung tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition.","Romero, Rodrigo;Sayin, Volkan I;Davidson, Shawn M;Bauer, Matthew R;Singh, Simranjit X;LeBoeuf, Sarah E;Karakousi, Triantafyllia R;Ellis, Donald C;Bhutkar, Arjun;Sánchez-Rivera, Francisco J;Subbaraj, Lakshmipriya;Martinez, Britney;Bronson, Roderick T;Prigge, Justin R;Schmidt, Edward E;Thomas, Craig J;Goparaju, Chandra;Davies, Angela;Dolgalev, Igor;Heguy, Adriana;Allaj, Viola;Poirier, John T;Moreira, Andre L;Rudin, Charles M;Pass, Harvey I;Vander Heiden, Matthew G;Jacks, Tyler;Papagiannakopoulos, Thales"
28967919,2017,Nature medicine,Chromosome 1q21.3 amplification is a trackable biomarker and actionable target for breast cancer recurrence.,"Tumor recurrence remains the main reason for breast cancer-associated mortality, and there are unmet clinical demands for the discovery of new biomarkers and development of treatment solutions to benefit patients with breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. Here we report the identification of chromosomal copy-number amplification at 1q21.3 that is enriched in subpopulations of breast cancer cells bearing characteristics of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and that strongly associates with breast cancer recurrence. Amplification is present in ∼10-30% of primary tumors but in more than 70% of recurrent tumors, regardless of breast cancer subtype. Detection of amplification in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood is strongly associated with early relapse in patients with breast cancer and could also be used to track the emergence of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We further show that 1q21.3-encoded S100 calcium-binding protein (S100A) family members, mainly S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9 (S100A7/8/9), and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) establish a reciprocal feedback loop driving tumorsphere growth. Notably, this functional circuitry can be disrupted by the small-molecule kinase inhibitor pacritinib, leading to preferential impairment of the growth of 1q21.3-amplified breast tumors. Our study uncovers the 1q21.3-directed S100A7/8/9-IRAK1 feedback loop as a crucial component of breast cancer recurrence, serving as both a trackable biomarker and an actionable therapeutic target for breast cancer.","Goh, Jian Yuan;Feng, Min;Wang, Wenyu;Oguz, Gokce;Yatim, Siti Maryam J M;Lee, Puay Leng;Bao, Yi;Lim, Tse Hui;Wang, Panpan;Tam, Wai Leong;Kodahl, Annette R;Lyng, Maria B;Sarma, Suman;Lin, Selena Y;Lezhava, Alexander;Yap, Yoon Sim;Lim, Alvin S T;Hoon, Dave S B;Ditzel, Henrik J;Lee, Soo Chin;Tan, Ern Yu;Yu, Qiang"
28920960,2017,Nature medicine,Long noncoding RNA EGFR-AS1 mediates epidermal growth factor receptor addiction and modulates treatment response in squamous cell carcinoma.,"Targeting EGFR is a validated approach in the treatment of squamous-cell cancers (SCCs), although there are no established biomarkers for predicting response. We have identified a synonymous mutation in EGFR, c.2361G>A (encoding p.Gln787Gln), in two patients with head and neck SCC (HNSCC) who were exceptional responders to gefitinib, and we showed in patient-derived cultures that the A/A genotype was associated with greater sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as compared to the G/A and G/G genotypes. Remarkably, single-copy G>A nucleotide editing in isogenic models conferred a 70-fold increase in sensitivity due to decreased stability of the EGFR-AS1 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). In the appropriate context, sensitivity could be recapitulated through EGFR-AS1 knockdown in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression was sufficient to induce resistance to TKIs. Reduced EGFR-AS1 levels shifted splicing toward EGFR isoform D, leading to ligand-mediated pathway activation. In co-clinical trials involving patients and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, tumor shrinkage was most pronounced in the context of the A/A genotype for EGFR-Q787Q, low expression of EGFR-AS1 and high expression of EGFR isoform D. Our study reveals how a 'silent' mutation influences the levels of a lncRNA, resulting in noncanonical EGFR addiction, and delineates a new predictive biomarker suite for response to EGFR TKIs.","Tan, Daniel S W;Chong, Fui Teen;Leong, Hui Sun;Toh, Shen Yon;Lau, Dawn P;Kwang, Xue Lin;Zhang, Xiaoqian;Sundaram, Gopinath M;Tan, Gek San;Chang, Mei Mei;Chua, Boon Tin;Lim, Wan Teck;Tan, Eng Huat;Ang, Mei Kim;Lim, Tony K H;Sampath, Prabha;Chowbay, Balram;Skanderup, Anders J;DasGupta, Ramanuj;Iyer, N Gopalakrishna"

28920957,2017,Nature medicine,KLF4-dependent perivascular cell plasticity mediates pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.,"A deeper understanding of the metastatic process is required for the development of new therapies that improve patient survival. Metastatic tumor cell growth and survival in distant organs is facilitated by the formation of a pre-metastatic niche that is composed of hematopoietic cells, stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Perivascular cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) and pericytes, are involved in new vessel formation and in promoting stem cell maintenance and proliferation. Given the well-described plasticity of perivascular cells, we hypothesized that perivascular cells similarly regulate tumor cell fate at metastatic sites. We used perivascular-cell-specific and pericyte-specific lineage-tracing models to trace the fate of perivascular cells in the pre-metastatic and metastatic microenvironments. We show that perivascular cells lose the expression of traditional vSMC and pericyte markers in response to tumor-secreted factors and exhibit increased proliferation, migration and ECM synthesis. Increased expression of the pluripotency gene Klf4 in these phenotypically switched perivascular cells promoted a less differentiated state, characterized by enhanced ECM production, that established a pro-metastatic fibronectin-rich environment. Genetic inactivation of Klf4 in perivascular cells decreased formation of a pre-metastatic niche and metastasis. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role for perivascular cells in pre-metastatic niche formation and uncovered novel strategies for limiting metastasis.","Murgai, Meera;Ju, Wei;Eason, Matthew;Kline, Jessica;Beury, Daniel W;Kaczanowska, Sabina;Miettinen, Markku M;Kruhlak, Michael;Lei, Haiyan;Shern, Jack F;Cherepanova, Olga A;Owens, Gary K;Kaplan, Rosandra N"
28892064,2017,Nature medicine,A mouse model for embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes uncovers the therapeutic potential of Sonic-hedgehog inhibitors.,"Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs) have recently been described as a new entity of rare pediatric brain tumors with a fatal outcome. We show here that ETMRs are characterized by a parallel activation of Shh and Wnt signaling. Co-activation of these pathways in mouse neural precursors is sufficient to induce ETMR-like tumors in vivo that resemble their human counterparts on the basis of histology and global gene-expression analyses, and that point to apical radial glia cells as the possible tumor cell of origin. Overexpression of LIN28A, which is a hallmark of human ETMRs, augments Sonic-hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt signaling in these precursor cells through the downregulation of let7-miRNA, and LIN28A/let7a interaction with the Shh pathway was detected at the level of Gli mRNA. Finally, human ETMR cells that were transplanted into immunocompromised host mice were responsive to the SHH inhibitor arsenic trioxide (ATO). Our work provides a novel mouse model in which to study this tumor type, demonstrates the driving role of Wnt and Shh activation in the growth of ETMRs and proposes downstream inhibition of Shh signaling as a therapeutic option for patients with ETMRs.","Neumann, Julia E;Wefers, Annika K;Lambo, Sander;Bianchi, Edoardo;Bockstaller, Marie;Dorostkar, Mario M;Meister, Valerie;Schindler, Pia;Korshunov, Andrey;von Hoff, Katja;Nowak, Johannes;Warmuth-Metz, Monika;Schneider, Marlon R;Renner-Müller, Ingrid;Merk, Daniel J;Shakarami, Mehdi;Sharma, Tanvi;Chavez, Lukas;Glass, Rainer;Chan, Jennifer A;Taketo, M Mark;Neumann, Philipp;Kool, Marcel;Schüller, Ulrich"

28869610,2017,Nature medicine,Mutations in ACTRT1 and its enhancer RNA elements lead to aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling in inherited and sporadic basal cell carcinomas.,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, results from aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Although most cases of BCC are sporadic, some forms are inherited, such as Bazex-Dupré-Christol syndrome (BDCS)-a cancer-prone genodermatosis with an X-linked, dominant inheritance pattern. We have identified mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, which encodes actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), in two of the six families with BDCS that were examined in this study. High-throughput sequencing in the four remaining families identified germline mutations in noncoding sequences surrounding ACTRT1. These mutations were located in transcribed sequences encoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and were shown to impair enhancer activity and ACTRT1 expression. ARP-T1 was found to directly bind to the GLI1 promoter, thus inhibiting GLI1 expression, and loss of ARP-T1 led to activation of the Hedgehog pathway in individuals with BDCS. Moreover, exogenous expression of ACTRT1 reduced the in vitro and in vivo proliferation rates of cell lines with aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In summary, our study identifies a disease mechanism in BCC involving mutations in regulatory noncoding elements and uncovers the tumor-suppressor properties of ACTRT1.","Bal, Elodie;Park, Hyun-Sook;Belaid-Choucair, Zakia;Kayserili, Hülya;Naville, Magali;Madrange, Marine;Chiticariu, Elena;Hadj-Rabia, Smail;Cagnard, Nicolas;Kuonen, Francois;Bachmann, Daniel;Huber, Marcel;Le Gall, Cindy;Côté, Francine;Hanein, Sylvain;Rosti, Rasim Özgür;Aslanger, Ayca Dilruba;Waisfisz, Quinten;Bodemer, Christine;Hermine, Olivier;Morice-Picard, Fanny;Labeille, Bruno;Caux, Frédéric;Mazereeuw-Hautier, Juliette;Philip, Nicole;Levy, Nicolas;Taieb, Alain;Avril, Marie-Françoise;Headon, Denis J;Gyapay, Gabor;Magnaldo, Thierry;Fraitag, Sylvie;Crollius, Hugues Roest;Vabres, Pierre;Hohl, Daniel;Munnich, Arnold;Smahi, Asma"

The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is the most frequently mutated in primary prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that wild-type SPOP binds to and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) by recognizing a degron motif common among them. In contrast, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants show impaired binding to BET proteins, resulting in decreased proteasomal degradation and accumulation of these proteins in prostate cancer cell lines and patient specimens and causing resistance to BET inhibitors. Transcriptome and BRD4 cistrome analyses reveal enhanced expression of the GTPase RAC1 and cholesterol-biosynthesis-associated genes together with activation of AKT-mTORC1 signaling as a consequence of BRD4 stabilization. Our data show that resistance to BET inhibitors in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer can be overcome by combination with AKT inhibitors and further support the evaluation of SPOP mutations as biomarkers to guide BET-inhibitor-oriented therapy in patients with prostate cancer.","Zhang, Pingzhao;Wang, Dejie;Zhao, Yu;Ren, Shancheng;Gao, Kun;Ye, Zhenqing;Wang, Shangqian;Pan, Chun-Wu;Zhu, Yasheng;Yan, Yuqian;Yang, Yinhui;Wu, Di;He, Yundong;Zhang, Jun;Lu, Daru;Liu, Xiuping;Yu, Long;Zhao, Shimin;Li, Yao;Lin, Dong;Wang, Yuzhuo;Wang, Liguo;Chen, Yu;Sun, Yinghao;Wang, Chenji;Huang, Haojie"
28805821,2017,Nature medicine,Opposing effects of cancer-type-specific SPOP mutants on BET protein degradation and sensitivity to BET inhibitors.,"It is generally assumed that recurrent mutations within a given cancer driver gene elicit similar drug responses. Cancer genome studies have identified recurrent but divergent missense mutations affecting the substrate-recognition domain of the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in endometrial and prostate cancers. The therapeutic implications of these mutations remain incompletely understood. Here we analyzed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutations and identified BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins (BETs) as SPOP-CUL3 substrates that are preferentially degraded by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutants. The resulting reduction of BET protein levels sensitized cancer cells to BET inhibitors. Conversely, prostate cancer-specific SPOP mutations resulted in impaired degradation of BETs, promoting their resistance to pharmacologic inhibition. These results uncover an oncogenomics paradox, whereby mutations mapping to the same domain evoke opposing drug susceptibilities. Specifically, we provide a molecular rationale for the use of BET inhibitors to treat patients with endometrial but not prostate cancer who harbor SPOP mutations.","Janouskova, Hana;El Tekle, Geniver;Bellini, Elisa;Udeshi, Namrata D;Rinaldi, Anna;Ulbricht, Anna;Bernasocchi, Tiziano;Civenni, Gianluca;Losa, Marco;Svinkina, Tanya;Bielski, Craig M;Kryukov, Gregory V;Cascione, Luciano;Napoli, Sara;Enchev, Radoslav I;Mutch, David G;Carney, Michael E;Berchuck, Andrew;Winterhoff, Boris J N;Broaddus, Russell R;Schraml, Peter;Moch, Holger;Bertoni, Francesco;Catapano, Carlo V;Peter, Matthias;Carr, Steven A;Garraway, Levi A;Wild, Peter J;Theurillat, Jean-Philippe P"
28805820,2017,Nature medicine,Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.,"The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins comprises four members-BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis-specific isoform BRDT-that largely function as transcriptional coactivators and play critical roles in various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion. BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer.

28628110,2017,Nature medicine,Colonic organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells for modeling colorectal cancer and drug testing.,"With the goal of modeling human disease of the large intestine, we sought to develop an effective protocol for deriving colonic organoids (COs) from differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Extensive gene and immunohistochemical profiling confirmed that the derived COs represent colon rather than small intestine, containing stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and the expected spectrum of differentiated cells, including goblet and endocrine cells. We applied this strategy to iPSCs derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP-iPSCs) harboring germline mutations in the WNT-signaling-pathway-regulator gene encoding APC, and we generated COs that exhibit enhanced WNT activity and increased epithelial cell proliferation, which we used as a platform for drug testing. Two potential compounds, XAV939 and rapamycin, decreased proliferation in FAP-COs, but also affected cell proliferation in wild-type COs, which thus limits their therapeutic application. By contrast, we found that geneticin, a ribosome-binding antibiotic with translational 'read-through' activity, efficiently targeted abnormal WNT activity and restored normal proliferation specifically in APC-mutant FAP-COs. These studies provide an efficient strategy for deriving human COs, which can be used in disease modeling and drug discovery for colorectal disease.","Crespo, Miguel;Vilar, Eduardo;Tsai, Su-Yi;Chang, Kyle;Amin, Sadaf;Srinivasan, Tara;Zhang, Tuo;Pipalia, Nina H;Chen, Huanhuan Joyce;Witherspoon, Mavee;Gordillo, Miriam;Xiang, Jenny Zhaoying;Maxfield, Frederick R;Lipkin, Steven;Evans, Todd;Chen, Shuibing"
28604702,2017,Nature medicine,ISDoT: in situ decellularization of tissues for high-resolution imaging and proteomic analysis of native extracellular matrix.,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a master regulator of cellular phenotype and behavior. It has a crucial role in both normal tissue homeostasis and disease pathology. Here we present a fast and efficient approach to enhance the study of ECM composition and structure. Termed in situ decellularization of tissues (ISDoT), it allows whole organs to be decellularized, leaving native ECM architecture intact. These three-dimensional decellularized tissues can be studied using high-resolution fluorescence and second harmonic imaging, and can be used for quantitative proteomic interrogation of the ECM. Our method is superior to other methods tested in its ability to preserve the structural integrity of the ECM, facilitate high-resolution imaging and quantitatively detect ECM proteins. In particular, we performed high-resolution sub-micron imaging of matrix topography in normal tissue and over the course of primary tumor development and progression to metastasis in mice, providing the first detailed imaging of the metastatic niche. These data show that cancer-driven ECM remodeling is organ specific, and that it is accompanied by comprehensive changes in ECM composition and topological structure. We also describe differing patterns of basement-membrane organization surrounding different types of blood vessels in healthy and diseased tissues. The ISDoT procedure allows for the study of native ECM structure under normal and pathological conditions in unprecedented detail.","Mayorca-Guiliani, Alejandro E;Madsen, Chris D;Cox, Thomas R;Horton, Edward R;Venning, Freja A;Erler, Janine T"

This Perspective focuses on advances in our understanding of the tumorigenesis and treatment of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Recent evidence from sequencing indicates that, although neuroendocrine tumors can arise de novo, they can also develop as a result of lineage plasticity in response to pressure from targeted therapies. We discuss the shared genomic alterations of these tumors independently of their site of origin, and we explore potential therapeutic strategies on the basis of recent biological findings.","Rickman, David S;Beltran, Himisha;Demichelis, Francesca;Rubin, Mark A"

We show here that modeling these genetic alterations by combined deletion of Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 specifically in renal epithelial cells in mice caused ccRCC. These tumors arose from proximal tubule epithelial cells and shared molecular markers and mRNA expression profiles with human ccRCC. Exome sequencing revealed that mouse and human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent mutations in genes associated with the primary cilium, uncovering a mutational convergence on this organelle and implicating a subset of ccRCCs as genetic ciliopathies. Different mouse tumors responded differently to standard therapies for advanced human ccRCC, mimicking the range of clinical behaviors in the human disease. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α transcription factors with acriflavine as third-line therapy had therapeutic effects in some tumors, providing preclinical evidence for further investigation of HIF-α inhibition as a ccRCC treatment. This autochthonous mouse ccRCC model represents a tool to investigate the biology of ccRCC and to identify new treatment strategies.","Harlander, Sabine;Schönenberger, Désirée;Toussaint, Nora C;Prummer, Michael;Catalano, Antonella;Brandt, Laura;Moch, Holger;Wild, Peter J;Frew, Ian J"

However, current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy, illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis.","Giustacchini, Alice;Thongjuea, Supat;Barkas, Nikolaos;Woll, Petter S;Povinelli, Benjamin J;Booth, Christopher A G;Sopp, Paul;Norfo, Ruggiero;Rodriguez-Meira, Alba;Ashley, Neil;Jamieson, Lauren;Vyas, Paresh;Anderson, Kristina;Segerstolpe, Åsa;Qian, Hong;Olsson-Strömberg, Ulla;Mustjoki, Satu;Sandberg, Rickard;Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W;Mead, Adam J"

28475571,2017,Nature medicine,Is autoimmunity the Achilles' heel of cancer immunotherapy?,"The emergence of immuno-oncology as the first broadly successful strategy for metastatic cancer will require clinicians to integrate this new pillar of medicine with chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted small-molecule compounds. Of equal importance is gaining an understanding of the limitations and toxicities of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy was initially perceived to be a relatively less toxic approach to cancer treatment than other available therapies-and surely it is, when compared to those. However, as the use of immunotherapy becomes more common, especially as first- and second-line treatments, immunotoxicity and autoimmunity are emerging as the Achilles' heel of immunotherapy. In this Perspective, we discuss evidence that the occurrence of immunotoxicity bodes well for the patient, and describe mechanisms that might be related to the induction of autoimmunity. We then explore approaches to limit immunotoxicity, and discuss the future directions of research and reporting that are needed to diminish it.","June, Carl H;Warshauer, Jeremy T;Bluestone, Jeffrey A"

Dectin 1 is an innate immune receptor crucial for anti-fungal immunity, but its role in sterile inflammation and oncogenesis has not been well defined. Furthermore, non-pathogen-derived ligands for dectin 1 have not been characterized. We found that dectin 1 is highly expressed on macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

28394329,2017,Nature medicine,A stemness-related ZEB1-MSRB3 axis governs cellular pliancy and breast cancer genome stability.,"Chromosomal instability (CIN), a feature of most adult neoplasms from their early stages onward, is a driver of tumorigenesis. However, several malignancy subtypes, including some triple-negative breast cancers, display a paucity of genomic aberrations, thus suggesting that tumor development may occur in the absence of CIN. Here we show that the differentiation status of normal human mammary epithelial cells dictates cell behavior after an oncogenic event and predetermines the genetic routes toward malignancy. Whereas oncogene induction in differentiated cells induces massive DNA damage, mammary stem cells are resistant, owing to a preemptive program driven by the transcription factor ZEB1 and the methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB3. The prevention of oncogene-induced DNA damage precludes induction of the oncosuppressive p53-dependent DNA-damage response, thereby increasing stem cells' intrinsic susceptibility to malignant transformation. In accord with this model, a subclass of breast neoplasms exhibit unique pathological features, including high ZEB1 expression, a low frequency of TP53 mutations and low CIN.","Morel, Anne-Pierre;Ginestier, Christophe;Pommier, Roxane M;Cabaud, Olivier;Ruiz, Emmanuelle;Wicinski, Julien;Devouassoux-Shisheboran, Mojgan;Combaret, Valérie;Finetti, Pascal;Chassot, Christelle;Pinatel, Christiane;Fauvet, Frédérique;Saintigny, Pierre;Thomas, Emilie;Moyret-Lalle, Caroline;Lachuer, Joël;Despras, Emmanuelle;Jauffret, Jean-Luc;Bertucci, François;Guitton, Jérôme;Wierinckx, Anne;Wang, Qing;Radosevic-Robin, Nina;Penault-Llorca, Frédérique;Cox, David G;Hollande, Frédéric;Ansieau, Stéphane;Caramel, Julie;Birnbaum, Daniel;Vigneron, Arnaud M;Tissier, Agnès;Charafe-Jauffret, Emmanuelle;Puisieux, Alain"

28319094,2017,Nature medicine,Targeting c-FOS and DUSP1 abrogates intrinsic resistance to tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.,"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for human cancers is not curative, and relapse occurs owing to the continued presence of tumor cells, referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD). The survival of MRD stem or progenitor cells in the absence of oncogenic kinase signaling, a phenomenon referred to as intrinsic resistance, depends on diverse growth factors. Here we report that oncogenic kinase and growth-factor signaling converge to induce the expression of the signaling proteins FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-FOS, encoded by Fos) and dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Genetic deletion of Fos and Dusp1 suppressed tumor growth in a BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase-induced mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacological inhibition of c-FOS, DUSP1 and BCR-ABL eradicated MRD in multiple in vivo models, as well as in mice xenotransplanted with patient-derived primary CML cells. Growth-factor signaling also conferred TKI resistance and induced FOS and DUSP1 expression in tumor cells modeling other types of kinase-driven leukemias. Our data demonstrate that c-FOS and DUSP1 expression levels determine the threshold of TKI efficacy, such that growth-factor-induced expression of c-FOS and DUSP1 confers intrinsic resistance to TKI therapy in a wide-ranging set of leukemias, and might represent a unifying Achilles' heel of kinase-driven cancers.","Kesarwani, Meenu;Kincaid, Zachary;Gomaa, Ahmed;Huber, Erika;Rohrabaugh, Sara;Siddiqui, Zain;Bouso, Muhammad F;Latif, Tahir;Xu, Ming;Komurov, Kakajan;Mulloy, James C;Cancelas, Jose A;Grimes, H Leighton;Azam, Mohammad"

The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice.

28288110,2017,Nature medicine,HRDetect is a predictor of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency based on mutational signatures.,"Approximately 1-5% of breast cancers are attributed to inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and are selectively sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In other cancer types, germline and/or somatic mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) also confer selective sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Thus, assays to detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors have been sought. Recently, somatic substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement patterns, or 'mutational signatures', were associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction. Herein we used a lasso logistic regression model to identify six distinguishing mutational signatures predictive of BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. A weighted model called HRDetect was developed to accurately detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient samples. HRDetect identifies BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors with 98.7% sensitivity (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). Application of this model in a cohort of 560 individuals with breast cancer, of whom 22 were known to carry a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, allowed us to identify an additional 22 tumors with somatic loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 47 tumors with functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency where no mutation was detected. We validated HRDetect on independent cohorts of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and demonstrated its efficacy in alternative sequencing strategies. Integrating all of the classes of mutational signatures thus reveals a larger proportion of individuals with breast cancer harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency (up to 22%) than hitherto appreciated (∼1-5%) who could have selective therapeutic sensitivity to PARP inhibition.","Davies, Helen;Glodzik, Dominik;Morganella, Sandro;Yates, Lucy R;Staaf, Johan;Zou, Xueqing;Ramakrishna, Manasa;Martin, Sancha;Boyault, Sandrine;Sieuwerts, Anieta M;Simpson, Peter T;King, Tari A;Raine, Keiran;Eyfjord, Jorunn E;Kong, Gu;Borg, Åke;Birney, Ewan;Stunnenberg, Hendrik G;van de Vijver, Marc J;Børresen-Dale, Anne-Lise;Martens, John W M;Span, Paul N;Lakhani, Sunil R;Vincent-Salomon, Anne;Sotiriou, Christos;Tutt, Andrew;Thompson, Alastair M;Van Laere, Steven;Richardson, Andrea L;Viari, Alain;Campbell, Peter J;Stratton, Michael R;Nik-Zainal, Serena"

28263311,2017,Nature medicine,A subset of platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress.,"Cisplatin and its platinum analogs, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are some of the most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics. Although cisplatin and carboplatin are used primarily in germ cell, breast and lung malignancies, oxaliplatin is instead used almost exclusively to treat colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers. Here we utilize a unique, multi-platform genetic approach to study the mechanism of action of these clinically established platinum anti-cancer agents, as well as more recently developed cisplatin analogs. We show that oxaliplatin, unlike cisplatin and carboplatin, does not kill cells through the DNA-damage response. Rather, oxaliplatin kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress. This difference in drug mechanism explains the distinct clinical implementation of oxaliplatin relative to cisplatin, and it might enable mechanistically informed selection of distinct platinum drugs for distinct malignancies. These data highlight the functional diversity of core components of front-line cancer therapy and the potential benefits of applying a mechanism-based rationale to the use of our current arsenal of anti-cancer drugs.","Bruno, Peter M;Liu, Yunpeng;Park, Ga Young;Murai, Junko;Koch, Catherine E;Eisen, Timothy J;Pritchard, Justin R;Pommier, Yves;Lippard, Stephen J;Hemann, Michael T"

Nearly 80% of DIPGs harbor mutations in histone H3 genes, wherein lysine 27 is substituted with methionine (H3K27M). H3K27M has been shown to inhibit polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a multiprotein complex responsible for the methylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me), by binding to its catalytic subunit EZH2. Although DIPGs with the H3K27M mutation show global loss of H3K27me3, several genes retain H3K27me3. Here we describe a mouse model of DIPG in which H3K27M potentiates tumorigenesis. Using this model and primary patient-derived DIPG cell lines, we show that H3K27M-expressing tumors require PRC2 for proliferation.

28263307,2017,Nature medicine,Therapeutic targeting of polycomb and BET bromodomain proteins in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive pediatric brainstem tumor characterized by rapid and uniform patient demise. A heterozygous point mutation of histone H3 occurs in more than 80% of these tumors and results in a lysine-to-methionine substitution (H3K27M). Expression of this histone mutant is accompanied by a reduction in the levels of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and this is hypothesized to be a driving event of DIPG oncogenesis. Despite a major loss of H3K27me3, PRC2 activity is still detected in DIPG cells positive for H3K27M. To investigate the functional roles of H3K27M and PRC2 in DIPG pathogenesis, we profiled the epigenome of H3K27M-mutant DIPG cells and found that H3K27M associates with increased H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). In accordance with previous biochemical data, the majority of the heterotypic H3K27M-K27ac nucleosomes colocalize with bromodomain proteins at the loci of actively transcribed genes, whereas PRC2 is excluded from these regions; this suggests that H3K27M does not sequester PRC2 on chromatin. Residual PRC2 activity is required to maintain DIPG proliferative potential, by repressing neuronal differentiation and function. Finally, to examine the therapeutic potential of blocking the recruitment of bromodomain proteins by heterotypic H3K27M-K27ac nucleosomes in DIPG cells, we performed treatments in vivo with BET bromodomain inhibitors and demonstrate that they efficiently inhibit tumor progression, thus identifying this class of compounds as potential therapeutics in DIPG.","Piunti, Andrea;Hashizume, Rintaro;Morgan, Marc A;Bartom, Elizabeth T;Horbinski, Craig M;Marshall, Stacy A;Rendleman, Emily J;Ma, Quanhong;Takahashi, Yoh-Hei;Woodfin, Ashley R;Misharin, Alexander V;Abshiru, Nebiyu A;Lulla, Rishi R;Saratsis, Amanda M;Kelleher, Neil L;James, C David;Shilatifard, Ali"
28191887,2017,Nature medicine,The creatine kinase pathway is a metabolic vulnerability in EVI1-positive acute myeloid leukemia.,"Expression of the MECOM (also known as EVI1) proto-oncogene is deregulated by chromosomal translocations in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Here, through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic cells, we reveal that EVI1 overexpression alters cellular metabolism. A screen using pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) identified the ATP-buffering, mitochondrial creatine kinase CKMT1 as necessary for survival of EVI1-expressing cells in subjects with EVI1-positive AML. EVI1 promotes CKMT1 expression by repressing the myeloid differentiation regulator RUNX1. Suppression of arginine-creatine metabolism by CKMT1-directed shRNAs or by the small molecule cyclocreatine selectively decreased the viability, promoted the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human EVI1-positive cell lines, and prolonged survival in both orthotopic xenograft models and mouse models of primary AML. CKMT1 inhibition altered mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, an effect that was abrogated by phosphocreatine-mediated reactivation of the arginine-creatine pathway. Targeting CKMT1 is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for this EVI1-driven AML subtype that is highly resistant to current treatment regimens.","Fenouille, Nina;Bassil, Christopher F;Ben-Sahra, Issam;Benajiba, Lina;Alexe, Gabriela;Ramos, Azucena;Pikman, Yana;Conway, Amy S;Burgess, Michael R;Li, Qing;Luciano, Frédéric;Auberger, Patrick;Galinsky, Ilene;DeAngelo, Daniel J;Stone, Richard M;Zhang, Yi;Perkins, Archibald S;Shannon, Kevin;Hemann, Michael T;Puissant, Alexandre;Stegmaier, Kimberly"
28191885,2017,Nature medicine,Molecular definition of a metastatic lung cancer state reveals a targetable CD109-Janus kinase-Stat axis.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the majority of mortality resulting from metastatic spread. However, the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells acquire the ability to disseminate from primary tumors, seed distant organs, and grow into tissue-destructive metastases remains incompletely understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival. Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical, pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable pro-metastatic CD109-Jak-Stat3 axis.","Chuang, Chen-Hua;Greenside, Peyton G;Rogers, Zoë N;Brady, Jennifer J;Yang, Dian;Ma, Rosanna K;Caswell, Deborah R;Chiou, Shin-Heng;Winters, Aidan F;Grüner, Barbara M;Ramaswami, Gokul;Spencley, Andrew L;Kopecky, Kimberly E;Sayles, Leanne C;Sweet-Cordero, E Alejandro;Li, Jin Billy;Kundaje, Anshul;Winslow, Monte M"
28165479,2017,Nature medicine,Whole-genome single-cell copy number profiling from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.,"A substantial proportion of tumors consist of genotypically distinct subpopulations of cancer cells. This intratumor genetic heterogeneity poses a substantial challenge for the implementation of precision medicine. Single-cell genomics constitutes a powerful approach to resolve complex mixtures of cancer cells by tracing cell lineages and discovering cryptic genetic variations that would otherwise be obscured in tumor bulk analyses. Because of the chemical alterations that result from formalin fixation, single-cell genomic approaches have largely remained limited to fresh or rapidly frozen specimens. Here we describe the development and validation of a robust and accurate methodology to perform whole-genome copy-number profiling of single nuclei obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor samples. We applied the single-cell sequencing approach described here to study the progression from in situ to invasive breast cancer, which revealed that ductal carcinomas in situ show intratumor genetic heterogeneity at diagnosis and that these lesions may progress to invasive breast cancer through a variety of evolutionary processes.","Martelotto, Luciano G;Baslan, Timour;Kendall, Jude;Geyer, Felipe C;Burke, Kathleen A;Spraggon, Lee;Piscuoglio, Salvatore;Chadalavada, Kalyani;Nanjangud, Gouri;Ng, Charlotte K Y;Moody, Pamela;D'Italia, Sean;Rodgers, Linda;Cox, Hilary;da Cruz Paula, Arnaud;Stepansky, Asya;Schizas, Michail;Wen, Hannah Y;King, Tari A;Norton, Larry;Weigelt, Britta;Hicks, James B;Reis-Filho, Jorge S"

28134926,2017,Nature medicine,DNA methylation heterogeneity defines a disease spectrum in Ewing sarcoma.,"Developmental tumors in children and young adults carry few genetic alterations, yet they have diverse clinical presentation. Focusing on Ewing sarcoma, we sought to establish the prevalence and characteristics of epigenetic heterogeneity in genetically homogeneous cancers. We performed genome-scale DNA methylation sequencing for a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma tumors and analyzed epigenetic heterogeneity on three levels: between cancers, between tumors, and within tumors. We observed consistent DNA hypomethylation at enhancers regulated by the disease-defining EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, thus establishing epigenomic enhancer reprogramming as a ubiquitous and characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma. DNA methylation differences between tumors identified a continuous disease spectrum underlying Ewing sarcoma, which reflected the strength of an EWS-FLI1 regulatory signature and a continuum between mesenchymal and stem cell signatures. There was substantial epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors, particularly in patients with metastatic disease. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of epigenetic heterogeneity in Ewing sarcoma and thereby highlights the importance of considering nongenetic aspects of tumor heterogeneity in the context of cancer biology and personalized medicine.","Sheffield, Nathan C;Pierron, Gaelle;Klughammer, Johanna;Datlinger, Paul;Schönegger, Andreas;Schuster, Michael;Hadler, Johanna;Surdez, Didier;Guillemot, Delphine;Lapouble, Eve;Freneaux, Paul;Champigneulle, Jacqueline;Bouvier, Raymonde;Walder, Diana;Ambros, Ingeborg M;Hutter, Caroline;Sorz, Eva;Amaral, Ana T;de Álava, Enrique;Schallmoser, Katharina;Strunk, Dirk;Rinner, Beate;Liegl-Atzwanger, Bernadette;Huppertz, Berthold;Leithner, Andreas;de Pinieux, Gonzague;Terrier, Philippe;Laurence, Valérie;Michon, Jean;Ladenstein, Ruth;Holter, Wolfgang;Windhager, Reinhard;Dirksen, Uta;Ambros, Peter F;Delattre, Olivier;Kovar, Heinrich;Bock, Christoph;Tomazou, Eleni M"
28067901,2017,Nature medicine,Targeting SAMHD1 with the Vpx protein to improve cytarabine therapy for hematological malignancies.,"The cytostatic deoxycytidine analog cytarabine (ara-C) is the most active agent available against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Together with anthracyclines, ara-C forms the backbone of AML treatment for children and adults. In AML, both the cytotoxicity of ara-C in vitro and the clinical response to ara-C therapy are correlated with the ability of AML blasts to accumulate the active metabolite ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), which causes DNA damage through perturbation of DNA synthesis. Differences in expression levels of known transporters or metabolic enzymes relevant to ara-C only partially account for patient-specific differential ara-CTP accumulation in AML blasts and response to ara-C treatment. Here we demonstrate that the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) promotes the detoxification of intracellular ara-CTP pools. Recombinant SAMHD1 exhibited ara-CTPase activity in vitro, and cells in which SAMHD1 expression was transiently reduced by treatment with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) protein Vpx were dramatically more sensitive to ara-C-induced cytotoxicity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the gene encoding SAMHD1 sensitized cells to ara-C, and this sensitivity could be abrogated by ectopic expression of wild-type (WT), but not dNTPase-deficient, SAMHD1. Mouse models of AML lacking SAMHD1 were hypersensitive to ara-C, and treatment ex vivo with Vpx sensitized primary patient-derived AML blasts to ara-C. Finally, we identified SAMHD1 as a risk factor in cohorts of both pediatric and adult patients with de novo AML who received ara-C treatment. Thus, SAMHD1 expression levels dictate patient sensitivity to ara-C, providing proof-of-concept that the targeting of SAMHD1 by Vpx could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for potentiating ara-C efficacy in hematological malignancies.","Herold, Nikolas;Rudd, Sean G;Ljungblad, Linda;Sanjiv, Kumar;Myrberg, Ida Hed;Paulin, Cynthia B J;Heshmati, Yaser;Hagenkort, Anna;Kutzner, Juliane;Page, Brent D G;Calderón-Montaño, José M;Loseva, Olga;Jemth, Ann-Sofie;Bulli, Lorenzo;Axelsson, Hanna;Tesi, Bianca;Valerie, Nicholas C K;Höglund, Andreas;Bladh, Julia;Wiita, Elisée;Sundin, Mikael;Uhlin, Michael;Rassidakis, Georgios;Heyman, Mats;Tamm, Katja Pokrovskaja;Warpman-Berglund, Ulrika;Walfridsson, Julian;Lehmann, Sören;Grandér, Dan;Lundbäck, Thomas;Kogner, Per;Henter, Jan-Inge;Helleday, Thomas;Schaller, Torsten"
28067900,2017,Nature medicine,Donor CD19 CAR T cells exert potent graft-versus-lymphoma activity with diminished graft-versus-host activity.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse after allo-HSCT remain major impediments to the success of allo-HSCT. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) direct tumor cell recognition of adoptively transferred T cells. CD19 is an attractive CAR target, which is expressed in most B cell malignancies, as well as in healthy B cells. Clinical trials using autologous CD19-targeted T cells have shown remarkable promise in various B cell malignancies. However, the use of allogeneic CAR T cells poses a concern in that it may increase risk of the occurrence of GVHD, although this has not been reported in selected patients infused with donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells after allo-HSCT. To understand the mechanism whereby allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells may mediate anti-lymphoma activity without causing a significant increase in the incidence of GVHD, we studied donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells in allo-HSCT and lymphoma models in mice. We demonstrate that alloreactive T cells expressing CD28-costimulated CD19 CARs experience enhanced stimulation, resulting in the progressive loss of both their effector function and proliferative potential, clonal deletion, and significantly decreased occurrence of GVHD. Concurrently, the other CAR T cells that were present in bulk donor T cell populations retained their anti-lymphoma activity in accordance with the requirement that both the T cell receptor (TCR) and CAR be engaged to accelerate T cell exhaustion. In contrast, first-generation and 4-1BB-costimulated CAR T cells increased the occurrence of GVHD. These findings could explain the reduced risk of GVHD occurring with cumulative TCR and CAR signaling.","Ghosh, Arnab;Smith, Melody;James, Scott E;Davila, Marco L;Velardi, Enrico;Argyropoulos, Kimon V;Gunset, Gertrude;Perna, Fabiana;Kreines, Fabiana M;Levy, Emily R;Lieberman, Sophie;Jay, Hillary V;Tuckett, Andrea Z;Zakrzewski, Johannes L;Tan, Lisa;Young, Lauren F;Takvorian, Kate;Dudakov, Jarrod A;Jenq, Robert R;Hanash, Alan M;Motta, Ana Carolina F;Murphy, George F;Liu, Chen;Schietinger, Andrea;Sadelain, Michel;van den Brink, Marcel R M"
28024083,2017,Nature medicine,Direct evidence for cancer-cell-autonomous extracellular protein catabolism in pancreatic tumors.,"Mammalian tissues rely on a variety of nutrients to support their physiological functions. It is known that altered metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, but which nutrients support the inappropriate growth of intact malignant tumors is incompletely understood. Amino acids are essential nutrients for many cancer cells that can be obtained through the scavenging and catabolism of extracellular protein via macropinocytosis. In particular, macropinocytosis can be a nutrient source for pancreatic cancer cells, but it is not fully understood how the tumor environment influences metabolic phenotypes and whether macropinocytosis supports the maintenance of amino acid levels within pancreatic tumors. Here we utilize miniaturized plasma exchange to deliver labeled albumin to tissues in live mice, and we demonstrate that breakdown of albumin contributes to the supply of free amino acids in pancreatic tumors. We also deliver albumin directly into tumors using an implantable microdevice, which was adapted and modified from ref. 9. Following implantation, we directly observe protein catabolism and macropinocytosis in situ by pancreatic cancer cells, but not by adjacent, non-cancerous pancreatic tissue. In addition, we find that intratumoral inhibition of macropinocytosis decreases amino acid levels. Taken together, these data suggest that pancreatic cancer cells consume extracellular protein, including albumin, and that this consumption serves as an important source of amino acids for pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.","Davidson, Shawn M;Jonas, Oliver;Keibler, Mark A;Hou, Han Wei;Luengo, Alba;Mayers, Jared R;Wyckoff, Jeffrey;Del Rosario, Amanda M;Whitman, Matthew;Chin, Christopher R;Condon, Kendall J;Lammers, Alex;Kellersberger, Katherine A;Stall, Brian K;Stephanopoulos, Gregory;Bar-Sagi, Dafna;Han, Jongyoon;Rabinowitz, Joshua D;Cima, Michael J;Langer, Robert;Vander Heiden, Matthew G"
27991919,2017,Nature medicine,SAMHD1 is a biomarker for cytarabine response and a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.,"The nucleoside analog cytarabine (Ara-C) is an essential component of primary and salvage chemotherapy regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After cellular uptake, Ara-C is converted into its therapeutically active triphosphate metabolite, Ara-CTP, which exerts antileukemic effects, primarily by inhibiting DNA synthesis in proliferating cells. Currently, a substantial fraction of patients with AML fail to respond effectively to Ara-C therapy, and reliable biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic response to Ara-C are lacking. SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that cleaves physiological dNTPs into deoxyribonucleosides and inorganic triphosphate. Although it has been postulated that SAMHD1 sensitizes cancer cells to nucleoside-analog derivatives through the depletion of competing dNTPs, we show here that SAMHD1 reduces Ara-C cytotoxicity in AML cells. Mechanistically, dGTP-activated SAMHD1 hydrolyzes Ara-CTP, which results in a drastic reduction of Ara-CTP in leukemic cells. Loss of SAMHD1 activity-through genetic depletion, mutational inactivation of its triphosphohydrolase activity or proteasomal degradation using specialized, virus-like particles-potentiates the cytotoxicity of Ara-C in AML cells. In mouse models of retroviral AML transplantation, as well as in retrospective analyses of adult patients with AML, the response to Ara-C-containing therapy was inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression. These results identify SAMHD1 as a potential biomarker for the stratification of patients with AML who might best respond to Ara-C-based therapy and as a target for treating Ara-C-refractory AML.","Schneider, Constanze;Oellerich, Thomas;Baldauf, Hanna-Mari;Schwarz, Sarah-Marie;Thomas, Dominique;Flick, Robert;Bohnenberger, Hanibal;Kaderali, Lars;Stegmann, Lena;Cremer, Anjali;Martin, Margarethe;Lohmeyer, Julian;Michaelis, Martin;Hornung, Veit;Schliemann, Christoph;Berdel, Wolfgang E;Hartmann, Wolfgang;Wardelmann, Eva;Comoglio, Federico;Hansmann, Martin-Leo;Yakunin, Alexander F;Geisslinger, Gerd;Ströbel, Philipp;Ferreirós, Nerea;Serve, Hubert;Keppler, Oliver T;Cinatl, Jindrich"

Dietary restriction regimens, including fasting, have been considered for the prevention and treatment of certain solid tumor types. However, whether and how dietary restriction affects hematopoietic malignancies is unknown. Here we report that fasting alone robustly inhibits the initiation and reverses the leukemic progression of both B cell and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL and T-ALL, respectively), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in mouse models of these tumors. Mechanistically, we found that attenuated leptin-receptor (LEPR) expression is essential for the development and maintenance of ALL, and that fasting inhibits ALL development by upregulation of LEPR and its downstream signaling through the protein PR/SET domain 1 (PRDM1). The expression of LEPR signaling-related genes correlated with the prognosis of pediatric patients with pre-B-ALL, and fasting effectively inhibited B-ALL growth in a human xenograft model. Our results indicate that the effects of fasting on tumor growth are cancer-type dependent, and they suggest new avenues for the development of treatment strategies for leukemia.","Lu, Zhigang;Xie, Jingjing;Wu, Guojin;Shen, Jinhui;Collins, Robert;Chen, Weina;Kang, Xunlei;Luo, Min;Zou, Yizhou;Huang, Lily Jun-Shen;Amatruda, James F;Slone, Tamra;Winick, Naomi;Scherer, Philipp E;Zhang, Cheng Cheng"
27941792,2017,Nature medicine,Loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 induces resistance to multiple drugs in acute myeloid leukemia.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), therapy resistance frequently occurs, leading to high mortality among patients. However, the mechanisms that render leukemic cells drug resistant remain largely undefined. Here, we identified loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation as a novel pathway of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic drugs in AML. Low EZH2 protein levels correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Suppression of EZH2 protein expression induced chemoresistance of AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Low EZH2 levels resulted in derepression of HOX genes, and knockdown of HOXB7 and HOXA9 in the resistant cells was sufficient to improve sensitivity to TKIs and cytotoxic drugs. The endogenous loss of EZH2 expression in resistant cells and primary blasts from a subset of relapsed AML patients resulted from enhanced CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr487. This interaction was stabilized by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and followed by proteasomal degradation of EZH2 in drug-resistant cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of HSP90, CDK1 and the proteasome prevented EZH2 degradation, decreased HOX gene expression and restored drug sensitivity. Finally, patients with reduced EZH2 levels at progression to standard therapy responded to the combination of bortezomib and cytarabine, concomitant with the re-establishment of EZH2 expression and blast clearance. These data suggest restoration of EZH2 protein as a viable approach to overcome treatment resistance in this AML patient population.","Göllner, Stefanie;Oellerich, Thomas;Agrawal-Singh, Shuchi;Schenk, Tino;Klein, Hans-Ulrich;Rohde, Christian;Pabst, Caroline;Sauer, Tim;Lerdrup, Mads;Tavor, Sigal;Stölzel, Friedrich;Herold, Sylvia;Ehninger, Gerhard;Köhler, Gabriele;Pan, Kuan-Ting;Urlaub, Henning;Serve, Hubert;Dugas, Martin;Spiekermann, Karsten;Vick, Binje;Jeremias, Irmela;Berdel, Wolfgang E;Hansen, Klaus;Zelent, Arthur;Wickenhauser, Claudia;Müller, Lutz P;Thiede, Christian;Müller-Tidow, Carsten"

27869804,2017,Nature medicine,Systemic depletion of L-cyst(e)ine with cyst(e)inase increases reactive oxygen species and suppresses tumor growth.,"Cancer cells experience higher oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) than do non-malignant cells because of genetic alterations and abnormal growth; as a result, maintenance of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is essential for their survival and proliferation. Under conditions of elevated ROS, endogenous L-cysteine (L-Cys) production is insufficient for GSH synthesis. This necessitates uptake of L-Cys that is predominantly in its disulfide form, L-cystine (CSSC), via the xCT(-) transporter. We show that administration of an engineered and pharmacologically optimized human cyst(e)inase enzyme mediates sustained depletion of the extracellular L-Cys and CSSC pool in mice and non-human primates. Treatment with this enzyme selectively causes cell cycle arrest and death in cancer cells due to depletion of intracellular GSH and ensuing elevated ROS; yet this treatment results in no apparent toxicities in mice even after months of continuous treatment.

We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC.

27869802,2017,Nature medicine,Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells identifies distinct copy-number profiles in patients with chemosensitive and chemorefractory small-cell lung cancer.,"In most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)-a metastatic, aggressive disease-the condition is initially chemosensitive but then relapses with acquired chemoresistance. In a minority of patients, however, relapse occurs within 3 months of initial treatment; in these cases, disease is defined as chemorefractory. The molecular mechanisms that differentiate chemosensitive from chemorefractory disease are currently unknown. To identify genetic features that distinguish chemosensitive from chemorefractory disease, we examined copy-number aberrations (CNAs) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from pretreatment SCLC blood samples. After analysis of 88 CTCs isolated from 13 patients (training set), we generated a CNA-based classifier that we validated in 18 additional patients (testing set, 112 CTC samples) and in six SCLC patient-derived CTC explant tumors. The classifier correctly assigned 83.3% of the cases as chemorefractory or chemosensitive. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in progression-free survival (PFS) (Kaplan-Meier P value = 0.0166) between patients designated as chemorefractory or chemosensitive by using the baseline CNA classifier. Notably, CTC CNA profiles obtained at relapse from five patients with initially chemosensitive disease did not switch to a chemorefractory CNA profile, which suggests that the genetic basis for initial chemoresistance differs from that underlying acquired chemoresistance.","Carter, Louise;Rothwell, Dominic G;Mesquita, Barbara;Smowton, Christopher;Leong, Hui Sun;Fernandez-Gutierrez, Fabiola;Li, Yaoyong;Burt, Deborah J;Antonello, Jenny;Morrow, Christopher J;Hodgkinson, Cassandra L;Morris, Karen;Priest, Lynsey;Carter, Mathew;Miller, Crispin;Hughes, Andrew;Blackhall, Fiona;Dive, Caroline;Brady, Ged"

27841872,2016,Nature medicine,IAP antagonists induce anti-tumor immunity in multiple myeloma.,"The cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAP) 1 and 2 are amplified in about 3% of cancers and have been identified in multiple malignancies as being potential therapeutic targets as a result of their role in the evasion of apoptosis. Consequently, small-molecule IAP antagonists, such as LCL161, have entered clinical trials for their ability to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. However, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are recurrently homozygously deleted in multiple myeloma (MM), resulting in constitutive activation of the noncanonical nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. To our surprise, we observed robust in vivo anti-myeloma activity of LCL161 in a transgenic myeloma mouse model and in patients with relapsed-refractory MM, where the addition of cyclophosphamide resulted in a median progression-free-survival of 10 months. This effect was not a result of direct induction of tumor cell death, but rather of upregulation of tumor-cell-autonomous type I interferon (IFN) signaling and a strong inflammatory response that resulted in the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to phagocytosis of tumor cells. Treatment of a MM mouse model with LCL161 established long-term anti-tumor protection and induced regression in a fraction of the mice.

27775705,2016,Nature medicine,PIM1 kinase inhibition as a targeted therapy against triple-negative breast tumors with elevated MYC expression.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which cells lack expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR) and the ERBB2 (also known as HER2) receptor, is the breast cancer subtype with the poorest outcome. No targeted therapy is available against this subtype of cancer owing to a lack of validated molecular targets. We previously reported that signaling involving MYC-an essential, pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes-is disproportionally higher in triple-negative (TN) tumors than in receptor-positive (RP) tumors. Direct inhibition of the oncogenic transcriptional activity of MYC has been challenging to achieve. Here, by conducting a shRNA screen targeting the kinome, we identified PIM1, a non-essential serine-threonine kinase, in a synthetic lethal interaction with MYC. PIM1 expression was higher in TN tumors than in RP tumors and was associated with poor prognosis in patients with hormone- and HER2-negative tumors. Small-molecule PIM kinase inhibitors halted the growth of human TN tumors with elevated MYC expression in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) and MYC-driven transgenic mouse models of breast cancer by inhibiting the oncogenic transcriptional activity of MYC and restoring the function of the endogenous cell cycle inhibitor, p27.

TNBC cells, but not nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, were dependent on PIM1 for proliferation and protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and dynamic BH3 profiling of apoptotic priming revealed that PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. In TNBC tumors and their cellular models, PIM1 expression was associated with several transcriptional signatures involving the transcription factor MYC, and PIM1 depletion in TNBC cell lines decreased, in a MYC-dependent manner, cell population growth and expression of the MYC target gene MCL1. Treatment with the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 impaired the growth of both cell line and patient-derived xenografts and sensitized them to standard-of-care chemotherapy. This work identifies PIM1 as a malignant-cell-selective target in TNBC and the potential use of PIM1 inhibitors for sensitizing TNBC to chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death.","Brasó-Maristany, Fara;Filosto, Simone;Catchpole, Steven;Marlow, Rebecca;Quist, Jelmar;Francesch-Domenech, Erika;Plumb, Darren A;Zakka, Leila;Gazinska, Patrycja;Liccardi, Gianmaria;Meier, Pascal;Gris-Oliver, Albert;Cheang, Maggie Chon U;Perdrix-Rosell, Anna;Shafat, Manar;Noël, Elodie;Patel, Nirmesh;McEachern, Kristen;Scaltriti, Maurizio;Castel, Pau;Noor, Farzana;Buus, Richard;Mathew, Sumi;Watkins, Johnathan;Serra, Violeta;Marra, Pierfrancesco;Grigoriadis, Anita;Tutt, Andrew N"
27748748,2016,Nature medicine,Recurrent MET fusion genes represent a drug target in pediatric glioblastoma.,"Pediatric glioblastoma is one of the most common and most deadly brain tumors in childhood. Using an integrative genetic analysis of 53 pediatric glioblastomas and five in vitro model systems, we identified previously unidentified gene fusions involving the MET oncogene in ∼10% of cases. These MET fusions activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and, in cooperation with lesions compromising cell cycle regulation, induced aggressive glial tumors in vivo. MET inhibitors suppressed MET tumor growth in xenograft models. Finally, we treated a pediatric patient bearing a MET-fusion-expressing glioblastoma with the targeted inhibitor crizotinib. This therapy led to substantial tumor shrinkage and associated relief of symptoms, but new treatment-resistant lesions appeared, indicating that combination therapies are likely necessary to achieve a durable clinical response.",
27748747,2016,Nature medicine,Vessel co-option mediates resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in liver metastases.,"The efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer is limited by resistance mechanisms that are poorly understood. Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.","Frentzas, Sophia;Simoneau, Eve;Bridgeman, Victoria L;Vermeulen, Peter B;Foo, Shane;Kostaras, Eleftherios;Nathan, Mark;Wotherspoon, Andrew;Gao, Zu-Hua;Shi, Yu;Van den Eynden, Gert;Daley, Frances;Peckitt, Clare;Tan, Xianming;Salman, Ayat;Lazaris, Anthoula;Gazinska, Patrycja;Berg, Tracy J;Eltahir, Zak;Ritsma, Laila;Van Rheenen, Jacco;Khashper, Alla;Brown, Gina;Nystrom, Hanna;Sund, Malin;Van Laere, Steven;Loyer, Evelyne;Dirix, Luc;Cunningham, David;Metrakos, Peter;Reynolds, Andrew R"
27723723,2016,Nature medicine,Microenvironment-dependent growth of preneoplastic and malignant plasma cells in humanized mice.,"Most human cancers, including myeloma, are preceded by a precursor state. There is an unmet need for in vivo models to study the interaction of human preneoplastic cells in the bone marrow microenvironment with non-malignant cells. Here, we genetically humanized mice to permit the growth of primary human preneoplastic and malignant plasma cells together with non-malignant cells in vivo. Growth was largely restricted to the bone marrow, mirroring the pattern in patients with myeloma. Xenografts captured the genomic complexity of parental tumors and revealed additional somatic changes. Moreover, xenografts from patients with preneoplastic gammopathy showed progressive growth, suggesting that the clinical stability of these lesions may in part be due to growth controls extrinsic to tumor cells. These data demonstrate a new approach to investigate the entire spectrum of human plasma cell neoplasia and illustrate the utility of humanized models for understanding the functional diversity of human tumors.","Das, Rituparna;Strowig, Till;Verma, Rakesh;Koduru, Srinivas;Hafemann, Anja;Hopf, Stephanie;Kocoglu, Mehmet H;Borsotti, Chiara;Zhang, Lin;Branagan, Andrew;Eynon, Elizabeth;Manz, Markus G;Flavell, Richard A;Dhodapkar, Madhav V"
27694933,2016,Nature medicine,Classification and characterization of microsatellite instability across 18 cancer types.,"Microsatellite instability (MSI), the spontaneous loss or gain of nucleotides from repetitive DNA tracts, is a diagnostic phenotype for gastrointestinal, endometrial, and colorectal tumors, yet the landscape of instability events across a wider variety of cancer types remains poorly understood. To explore MSI across malignancies, we examined 5,930 cancer exomes from 18 cancer types at more than 200,000 microsatellite loci and constructed a genomic classifier for MSI. We identified MSI-positive tumors in 14 of the 18 cancer types. We also identified loci that were more likely to be unstable in particular cancer types, resulting in specific instability signatures that involved cancer-associated genes, suggesting that instability patterns reflect selective pressures and can potentially identify novel cancer drivers. We also observed a correlation between survival outcomes and the overall burden of unstable microsatellites, suggesting that MSI may be a continuous, rather than discrete, phenotype that is informative across cancer types. These analyses offer insight into conserved and cancer-specific properties of MSI and reveal opportunities for improved methods of clinical MSI diagnosis and cancer gene discovery.","Hause, Ronald J;Pritchard, Colin C;Shendure, Jay;Salipante, Stephen J"

This process is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an attractive but traditionally intractable drug target. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that in preclinical models ACC is required to maintain the de novo fatty acid synthesis needed for growth and viability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We describe the ability of ND-646-an allosteric inhibitor of the ACC enzymes ACC1 and ACC2 that prevents ACC subunit dimerization-to suppress fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo.

27618649,2016,Nature medicine,HAUSP deubiquitinates and stabilizes N-Myc in neuroblastoma.,"The MYCN proto-oncogene is amplified in a number of advanced-stage human tumors, such as neuroblastomas. Similar to other members of the MYC family of oncoproteins, MYCN (also known as N-Myc) is a transcription factor, and its stability and activity are tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that N-Myc is a driver of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, therapies that directly suppress N-Myc activity in human tumors are limited. Here we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7; also known as HAUSP) as a regulator of N-Myc function in neuroblastoma. HAUSP interacts with N-Myc, and HAUSP expression induces deubiquitination and subsequent stabilization of N-Myc. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of USP7 in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines, or genetic ablation of Usp7 in the mouse brain, destabilizes N-Myc, which leads to inhibition of N-Myc function. Notably, HAUSP is more abundant in patients with neuroblastoma who have poorer prognosis, and HAUSP expression substantially correlates with N-Myc transcriptional activity. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors of HAUSP's deubiquitinase activity markedly suppress the growth of MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cell lines in xenograft mouse models. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a crucial role of HAUSP in regulating N-Myc function in vivo and suggest that HAUSP inhibition is a potential therapy for MYCN-amplified tumors.","Tavana, Omid;Li, Dawei;Dai, Chao;Lopez, Gonzalo;Banerjee, Debarshi;Kon, Ning;Chen, Chao;Califano, Andrea;Yamashiro, Darrell J;Sun, Hongbin;Gu, Wei"
27603132,2016,Nature medicine,Therapeutic targeting of splicing in cancer.,"Recent studies have highlighted that splicing patterns are frequently altered in cancer and that mutations in genes encoding spliceosomal proteins, as well as mutations affecting the splicing of key cancer-associated genes, are enriched in cancer. In parallel, there is also accumulating evidence that several molecular subtypes of cancer are highly dependent on splicing function for cell survival. These findings have resulted in a growing interest in targeting splicing catalysis, splicing regulatory proteins, and/or specific key altered splicing events in the treatment of cancer. Here we present strategies that exist and that are in development to target altered dependency on the spliceosome, as well as aberrant splicing, in cancer. These include drugs to target global splicing in cancer subtypes that are preferentially dependent on wild-type splicing for survival, methods to alter post-translational modifications of splicing-regulating proteins, and strategies to modulate pathologic splicing events and protein-RNA interactions in cancer.","Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei;Abdel-Wahab, Omar"
27571348,2016,Nature medicine,An AMP-activated protein kinase-stabilizing peptide ameliorates adipose tissue wasting in cancer cachexia in mice.,"Cachexia represents a fatal energy-wasting syndrome in a large number of patients with cancer that mostly results in a pathological loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Here we show that tumor cell exposure and tumor growth in mice triggered a futile energy-wasting cycle in cultured white adipocytes and white adipose tissue (WAT), respectively. Although uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-dependent thermogenesis was dispensable for tumor-induced body wasting, WAT from cachectic mice and tumor-cell-supernatant-treated adipocytes were consistently characterized by the simultaneous induction of both lipolytic and lipogenic pathways. Paradoxically, this was accompanied by an inactivated AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk), which is normally activated in peripheral tissues during states of low cellular energy. Ampk inactivation correlated with its degradation and with upregulation of the Ampk-interacting protein Cidea. Therefore, we developed an Ampk-stabilizing peptide, ACIP, which was able to ameliorate WAT wasting in vitro and in vivo by shielding the Cidea-targeted interaction surface on Ampk. Thus, our data establish the Ucp1-independent remodeling of adipocyte lipid homeostasis as a key event in tumor-induced WAT wasting, and we propose the ACIP-dependent preservation of Ampk integrity in the WAT as a concept in future therapies for cachexia.","Rohm, Maria;Schäfer, Michaela;Laurent, Victor;Üstünel, Bilgen Ekim;Niopek, Katharina;Algire, Carolyn;Hautzinger, Oksana;Sijmonsma, Tjeerd P;Zota, Annika;Medrikova, Dasa;Pellegata, Natalia S;Ryden, Mikael;Kulyte, Agné;Dahlman, Ingrid;Arner, Peter;Petrovic, Natasa;Cannon, Barbara;Amri, Ez-Zoubir;Kemp, Bruce E;Steinberg, Gregory R;Janovska, Petra;Kopecky, Jan;Wolfrum, Christian;Blüher, Matthias;Berriel Diaz, Mauricio;Herzig, Stephan"
27548575,2016,Nature medicine,Endothelial exocytosis of angiopoietin-2 resulting from CCM3 deficiency contributes to cerebral cavernous malformation.,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations that affect the central nervous system and result in cerebral hemorrhage, seizure and stroke. CCMs arise from loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes: KRIT1 (also known as CCM1), CCM2 or PDCD10 (also known as CCM3). PDCD10 mutations in humans often result in a more severe form of the disease relative to mutations in the other two CCM genes, and PDCD10-knockout mice show severe defects, the mechanistic basis for which is unclear. We have recently reported that CCM3 regulates exocytosis mediated by the UNC13 family of exocytic regulatory proteins. Here, in investigating the role of endothelial cell exocytosis in CCM disease progression, we found that CCM3 suppresses UNC13B- and vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3)-dependent exocytosis of angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) in brain endothelial cells. CCM3 deficiency in endothelial cells augments the exocytosis and secretion of ANGPT2, which is associated with destabilized endothelial cell junctions, enlarged lumen formation and endothelial cell-pericyte dissociation. UNC13B deficiency, which blunts ANGPT2 secretion from endothelial cells, or treatment with an ANGPT2-neutralizing antibody normalizes the defects in the brain and retina caused by endothelial-cell-specific CCM3 deficiency, including the disruption of endothelial cell junctions, vessel dilation and pericyte dissociation. Thus, enhanced secretion of ANGPT2 in endothelial cells contributes to the progression of CCM disease, providing a new therapeutic approach for treating this devastating pathology.","Jenny Zhou, Huanjiao;Qin, Lingfeng;Zhang, Haifeng;Tang, Wenwen;Ji, Weidong;He, Yun;Liang, Xiaoling;Wang, Zongren;Yuan, Qianying;Vortmeyer, Alexander;Toomre, Derek;Fuh, Germaine;Yan, Minghong;Kluger, Martin S;Wu, Dianqing;Min, Wang"
27500726,2016,Nature medicine,Loss of cohesin complex components STAG2 or STAG3 confers resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma.,"The protein kinase B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) is an oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in melanoma. Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) have shown high response rates and extended survival in patients with melanoma who bear tumors that express mutations encoding BRAF proteins mutant at Val600, but a vast majority of these patients develop drug resistance. Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3.","Shen, Che-Hung;Kim, Sun Hye;Trousil, Sebastian;Frederick, Dennie T;Piris, Adriano;Yuan, Ping;Cai, Li;Gu, Lei;Li, Man;Lee, Jung Hyun;Mitra, Devarati;Fisher, David E;Sullivan, Ryan J;Flaherty, Keith T;Zheng, Bin"
27376578,2016,Nature medicine,p53 induces formation of NEAT1 lncRNA-containing paraspeckles that modulate replication stress response and chemosensitivity.,"In a search for mediators of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which induces pleiotropic and often antagonistic cellular responses, we identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1. NEAT1 is an essential architectural component of paraspeckle nuclear bodies, whose pathophysiological relevance remains unclear. Activation of p53, pharmacologically or by oncogene-induced replication stress, stimulated the formation of paraspeckles in mouse and human cells. Silencing Neat1 expression in mice, which prevents paraspeckle formation, sensitized preneoplastic cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death and impaired skin tumorigenesis. We provide mechanistic evidence that NEAT1 promotes ATR signaling in response to replication stress and is thereby engaged in a negative feedback loop that attenuates oncogene-dependent activation of p53. NEAT1 targeting in established human cancer cell lines induced synthetic lethality with genotoxic chemotherapeutics, including PARP inhibitors, and nongenotoxic activation of p53. This study establishes a key genetic link between NEAT1 paraspeckles, p53 biology and tumorigenesis and identifies NEAT1 as a promising target to enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to both chemotherapy and p53 reactivation therapy.","Adriaens, Carmen;Standaert, Laura;Barra, Jasmine;Latil, Mathilde;Verfaillie, Annelien;Kalev, Peter;Boeckx, Bram;Wijnhoven, Paul W G;Radaelli, Enrico;Vermi, William;Leucci, Eleonora;Lapouge, Gaëlle;Beck, Benjamin;van den Oord, Joost;Nakagawa, Shinichi;Hirose, Tetsuro;Sablina, Anna A;Lambrechts, Diether;Aerts, Stein;Blanpain, Cédric;Marine, Jean-Christophe"
27376576,2016,Nature medicine,Targeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to checkpoint immunotherapy.,"Single-agent immunotherapy has achieved limited clinical benefit to date in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This may be a result of the presence of a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Critical obstacles to immunotherapy in PDAC tumors include a high number of tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells and a uniquely desmoplastic stroma that functions as a barrier to T cell infiltration. We identified hyperactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity in neoplastic PDAC cells as an important regulator of the fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME. We found that FAK activity was elevated in human PDAC tissues and correlated with high levels of fibrosis and poor CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Single-agent FAK inhibition using the selective FAK inhibitor VS-4718 substantially limited tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of survival in the p48-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D);Trp53(flox/+) (KPC) mouse model of human PDAC. This delay in tumor progression was associated with markedly reduced tumor fibrosis and decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells. We also found that FAK inhibition rendered the previously unresponsive KPC mouse model responsive to T cell immunotherapy and PD-1 antagonists. These data suggest that FAK inhibition increases immune surveillance by overcoming the fibrotic and immunosuppressive PDAC TME and renders tumors responsive to immunotherapy.","Jiang, Hong;Hegde, Samarth;Knolhoff, Brett L;Zhu, Yu;Herndon, John M;Meyer, Melissa A;Nywening, Timothy M;Hawkins, William G;Shapiro, Irina M;Weaver, David T;Pachter, Jonathan A;Wang-Gillam, Andrea;DeNardo, David G"

We examined epigenetic heterogeneity as assessed by cytosine methylation within defined genomic loci with four CpGs (epialleles), somatic mutations, and transcriptomes of AML patient samples at serial time points. We observed that epigenetic allele burden is linked to inferior outcome and varies considerably during disease progression. Epigenetic and genetic allelic burden and patterning followed different patterns and kinetics during disease progression. We observed a subset of AMLs with high epiallele and low somatic mutation burden at diagnosis, a subset with high somatic mutation and lower epiallele burdens at diagnosis, and a subset with a mixed profile, suggesting distinct modes of tumor heterogeneity. Genes linked to promoter-associated epiallele shifts during tumor progression showed increased single-cell transcriptional variance and differential expression, suggesting functional impact on gene regulation. Thus, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity can occur with distinct kinetics likely to affect the biological and clinical features of tumors.","Li, Sheng;Garrett-Bakelman, Francine E;Chung, Stephen S;Sanders, Mathijs A;Hricik, Todd;Rapaport, Franck;Patel, Jay;Dillon, Richard;Vijay, Priyanka;Brown, Anna L;Perl, Alexander E;Cannon, Joy;Bullinger, Lars;Luger, Selina;Becker, Michael;Lewis, Ian D;To, Luen Bik;Delwel, Ruud;Löwenberg, Bob;Döhner, Hartmut;Döhner, Konstanze;Guzman, Monica L;Hassane, Duane C;Roboz, Gail J;Grimwade, David;Valk, Peter J M;D'Andrea, Richard J;Carroll, Martin;Park, Christopher Y;Neuberg, Donna;Levine, Ross;Melnick, Ari M;Mason, Christopher E"
27322743,2016,Nature medicine,RANK ligand as a potential target for breast cancer prevention in BRCA1-mutation carriers.,"Individuals who have mutations in the breast-cancer-susceptibility gene BRCA1 (hereafter referred to as BRCA1-mutation carriers) frequently undergo prophylactic mastectomy to minimize their risk of breast cancer. The identification of an effective prevention therapy therefore remains a 'holy grail' for the field. Precancerous BRCA1(mut/+) tissue harbors an aberrant population of luminal progenitor cells, and deregulated progesterone signaling has been implicated in BRCA1-associated oncogenesis. Coupled with the findings that tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11; also known as RANKL) is a key paracrine effector of progesterone signaling and that RANKL and its receptor TNFRSF11A (also known as RANK) contribute to mammary tumorigenesis, we investigated a role for this pathway in the pre-neoplastic phase of BRCA1-mutation carriers. We identified two subsets of luminal progenitors (RANK(+) and RANK(-)) in histologically normal tissue of BRCA1-mutation carriers and showed that RANK(+) cells are highly proliferative, have grossly aberrant DNA repair and bear a molecular signature similar to that of basal-like breast cancer. These data suggest that RANK(+) and not RANK(-) progenitors are a key target population in these women. Inhibition of RANKL signaling by treatment with denosumab in three-dimensional breast organoids derived from pre-neoplastic BRCA1(mut/+) tissue attenuated progesterone-induced proliferation. Notably, proliferation was markedly reduced in breast biopsies from BRCA1-mutation carriers who were treated with denosumab. Furthermore, inhibition of RANKL in a Brca1-deficient mouse model substantially curtailed mammary tumorigenesis. Taken together, these findings identify a targetable pathway in a putative cell-of-origin population in BRCA1-mutation carriers and implicate RANKL blockade as a promising strategy in the prevention of breast cancer.","Nolan, Emma;Vaillant, François;Branstetter, Daniel;Pal, Bhupinder;Giner, Göknur;Whitehead, Lachlan;Lok, Sheau W;Mann, Gregory B;Rohrbach, Kathy;Huang, Li-Ya;Soriano, Rosalia;Smyth, Gordon K;Dougall, William C;Visvader, Jane E;Lindeman, Geoffrey J"

We report the development of orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of HER2-expressing breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM), and their use for the identification of targeted combination therapies. Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR resulted in durable tumor regressions in three of five PDXs, and therapeutic response was correlated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, an mTORC1 effector. The two nonresponding PDXs showed hypermutated genomes with enrichment of mutations in DNA-repair genes, which suggests an association of genomic instability with therapeutic resistance. These findings suggest that a biomarker-driven clinical trial of PI3K inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor should be conducted for patients with HER2-positive BCBM.","Ni, Jing;Ramkissoon, Shakti H;Xie, Shaozhen;Goel, Shom;Stover, Daniel G;Guo, Hanbing;Luu, Victor;Marco, Eugenio;Ramkissoon, Lori A;Kang, Yun Jee;Hayashi, Marika;Nguyen, Quang-De;Ligon, Azra H;Du, Rose;Claus, Elizabeth B;Alexander, Brian M;Yuan, Guo-Cheng;Wang, Zhigang C;Iglehart, J Dirk;Krop, Ian E;Roberts, Thomas M;Winer, Eric P;Lin, Nancy U;Ligon, Keith L;Zhao, Jean J"

However, current models do not fully mimic the components of the human bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and they enable only limited engraftment of samples from some human malignancies. Here we show that a xenotransplantation model bearing subcutaneous humanized ossicles with an accessible BM microenvironment, formed by in situ differentiation of human BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, enables the robust engraftment of healthy human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, at levels much greater than those in unmanipulated mice. Direct intraossicle transplantation accelerated engraftment and resulted in the detection of substantially higher leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) frequencies. We also observed robust engraftment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and myelofibrosis (MF) samples, and identified LICs in these malignancies. This humanized ossicle xenotransplantation approach provides a system for modeling a wide variety of human hematological diseases.","Reinisch, Andreas;Thomas, Daniel;Corces, M Ryan;Zhang, Xiaohua;Gratzinger, Dita;Hong, Wan-Jen;Schallmoser, Katharina;Strunk, Dirk;Majeti, Ravindra"
27213815,2016,Nature medicine,A MYC-aurora kinase A protein complex represents an actionable drug target in p53-altered liver cancer.,"MYC oncoproteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of the majority of human tumors but are considered undruggable. By using a direct in vivo shRNA screen, we show that liver cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) and that are driven by the oncoprotein NRAS become addicted to MYC stabilization via a mechanism mediated by aurora kinase A (AURKA). This MYC stabilization enables the tumor cells to overcome a latent G2/M cell cycle arrest that is mediated by AURKA and the tumor suppressor protein p19(ARF). MYC directly binds to AURKA, and inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors results in subsequent MYC degradation and cell death. These conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, with one of them currently being tested in early clinical trials, suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing Trp53-deficient, NRAS-driven MYC-expressing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). TP53-mutated human HCCs revealed increased AURKA expression and a positive correlation between AURKA and MYC expression. In xenograft models, mice bearing TP53-mutated or TP53-deleted human HCCs were hypersensitive to treatment with conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, thus suggesting a therapeutic strategy for this subgroup of human HCCs.","Dauch, Daniel;Rudalska, Ramona;Cossa, Giacomo;Nault, Jean-Charles;Kang, Tae-Won;Wuestefeld, Torsten;Hohmeyer, Anja;Imbeaud, Sandrine;Yevsa, Tetyana;Hoenicke, Lisa;Pantsar, Tatu;Bozko, Przemyslaw;Malek, Nisar P;Longerich, Thomas;Laufer, Stefan;Poso, Antti;Zucman-Rossi, Jessica;Eilers, Martin;Zender, Lars"

However, complete and durable responses to targeted therapy are rare in individuals with advanced-stage solid cancers. Even the most effective targeted therapies generally do not induce a complete tumor response, resulting in residual disease and tumor progression that limits patient survival. We discuss the emerging need to more fully understand the molecular basis of residual disease as a prelude to designing therapeutic strategies to minimize or eliminate residual disease so that we can move from temporary to chronic control of disease, or a cure, for patients with advanced-stage solid cancers. Ultimately, we propose a shift from the current reactive paradigm of analyzing and treating acquired drug resistance to a pre-emptive paradigm of defining the mechanisms that result in residual disease, to target and limit this disease reservoir.","Bivona, Trever G;Doebele, Robert C"

27135741,2016,Nature medicine,The EGFR-specific antibody cetuximab combined with chemotherapy triggers immunogenic cell death.,"Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that is effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Cetuximab blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ligand interaction and inhibits downstream RAS-ERK activation. However, only some activating mutations in RAS affect cetuximab efficacy, and it is not clear what else mediates treatment success. Here we hypothesized that cetuximab induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) that activates a potent antitumor response. We found that cetuximab, in combination with chemotherapy, fostered ICD in CRC cells, which we measured via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and an increase in phagocytosis by dendritic cells. ICD induction depended on the mutational status of the EGFR signaling pathway and on the inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), an unfolded protein response (UPR) mediator. We confirmed the enhanced immunogenicity elicited by cetuximab in a mouse model of human EGFR-expressing CRC. Overall, we demonstrate a new, immune-related mechanism of action of cetuximab that may help to tailor personalized medicine.","Pozzi, Chiara;Cuomo, Alessandro;Spadoni, Ilaria;Magni, Elena;Silvola, Alessio;Conte, Alexia;Sigismund, Sara;Ravenda, Paola Simona;Bonaldi, Tiziana;Zampino, Maria Giulia;Cancelliere, Carlotta;Di Fiore, Pier Paolo;Bardelli, Alberto;Penna, Giuseppe;Rescigno, Maria"

Spliceosomal gene mutations are always heterozygous and rarely occur together with one another, suggesting that cells may tolerate only a partial deviation from normal splicing activity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered mice to express a mutated allele of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (Srsf2(P95H))-which commonly occurs in individuals with MDS and AML-in an inducible, hemizygous manner in hematopoietic cells. These mice rapidly succumbed to fatal bone marrow failure, demonstrating that Srsf2-mutated cells depend on the wild-type Srsf2 allele for survival. In the context of leukemia, treatment with the spliceosome inhibitor E7107 (refs. 7,8) resulted in substantial reductions in leukemic burden, specifically in isogenic mouse leukemias and patient-derived xenograft AMLs carrying spliceosomal mutations. Whereas E7107 treatment of mice resulted in widespread intron retention and cassette exon skipping in leukemic cells regardless of Srsf2 genotype, the magnitude of splicing inhibition following E7107 treatment was greater in Srsf2-mutated than in Srsf2-wild-type leukemia, consistent with the differential effect of E7107 on survival. Collectively, these data provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that leukemias with spliceosomal gene mutations are preferentially susceptible to additional splicing perturbations in vivo as compared to leukemias without such mutations. Modulation of spliceosome function may thus provide a new therapeutic avenue in genetically defined subsets of individuals with MDS or AML.","Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei;Dvinge, Heidi;Kim, Eunhee;Cho, Hana;Micol, Jean-Baptiste;Chung, Young Rock;Durham, Benjamin H;Yoshimi, Akihide;Kim, Young Joon;Thomas, Michael;Lobry, Camille;Chen, Chun-Wei;Pastore, Alessandro;Taylor, Justin;Wang, Xujun;Krivtsov, Andrei;Armstrong, Scott A;Palacino, James;Buonamici, Silvia;Smith, Peter G;Bradley, Robert K;Abdel-Wahab, Omar"
27135739,2016,Nature medicine,Excessive fatty acid oxidation induces muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia.,"Cachexia is a devastating muscle-wasting syndrome that occurs in patients who have chronic diseases. It is most commonly observed in individuals with advanced cancer, presenting in 80% of these patients, and it is one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality associated with cancer. Additionally, although many people with cachexia show hypermetabolism, the causative role of metabolism in muscle atrophy has been unclear. To understand the molecular basis of cachexia-associated muscle atrophy, it is necessary to develop accurate models of the condition. By using transcriptomics and cytokine profiling of human muscle stem cell-based models and human cancer-induced cachexia models in mice, we found that cachectic cancer cells secreted many inflammatory factors that rapidly led to high levels of fatty acid metabolism and to the activation of a p38 stress-response signature in skeletal muscles, before manifestation of cachectic muscle atrophy occurred. Metabolomics profiling revealed that factors secreted by cachectic cancer cells rapidly induce excessive fatty acid oxidation in human myotubes, which leads to oxidative stress, p38 activation and impaired muscle growth. Pharmacological blockade of fatty acid oxidation not only rescued human myotubes, but also improved muscle mass and body weight in cancer cachexia models in vivo. Therefore, fatty acid-induced oxidative stress could be targeted to prevent cancer-induced cachexia.","Fukawa, Tomoya;Yan-Jiang, Benjamin Chua;Min-Wen, Jason Chua;Jun-Hao, Elwin Tan;Huang, Dan;Qian, Chao-Nan;Ong, Pauline;Li, Zhimei;Chen, Shuwen;Mak, Shi Ya;Lim, Wan Jun;Kanayama, Hiro-Omi;Mohan, Rosmin Elsa;Wang, Ruiqi Rachel;Lai, Jiunn Herng;Chua, Clarinda;Ong, Hock Soo;Tan, Ker-Kan;Ho, Ying Swan;Tan, Iain Beehuat;Teh, Bin Tean;Shyh-Chang, Ng"
27135738,2016,Nature medicine,An oncogenic Ezh2 mutation induces tumors through global redistribution of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation.,"B cell lymphoma and melanoma harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the EZH2 histone methyltransferase (EZH2), but the carcinogenic role of these mutations is unclear. Here we describe a mouse model in which the most common somatic Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2(Y646F) in human; Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse) is conditionally expressed. Expression of Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse B cells or melanocytes caused high-penetrance lymphoma or melanoma, respectively. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, but not the oncoprotein Myc, or loss of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) further accelerated lymphoma progression. Expression of the mutant Braf but not the mutant Nras oncoprotein further accelerated melanoma progression. Although expression of Ezh2(Y641F) globally increased the abundance of trimethylated Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), it also caused a widespread redistribution of this repressive mark, including a loss of H3K27me3 that was associated with increased transcription at many loci. These results suggest that Ezh2(Y641F) induces lymphoma and melanoma through a vast reorganization of chromatin structure, inducing both repression and activation of polycomb-regulated loci.","Souroullas, George P;Jeck, William R;Parker, Joel S;Simon, Jeremy M;Liu, Jie-Yu;Paulk, Joshiawa;Xiong, Jessie;Clark, Kelly S;Fedoriw, Yuri;Qi, Jun;Burd, Christin E;Bradner, James E;Sharpless, Norman E"

This limits the ability to study the epigenomes of valuable, clinically annotated tissue resources. Here we describe fixed-tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (FiT-seq), a method that enables reliable extraction of soluble chromatin from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples for accurate detection of histone marks. We demonstrate that FiT-seq data from FFPE specimens are concordant with ChIP-seq data from fresh-frozen samples of the same tumors. By using multiple histone marks, we generate chromatin-state maps and identify cis-regulatory elements in clinical samples from various tumor types that can readily allow us to distinguish between cancers by the tissue of origin. Tumor-specific enhancers and superenhancers that are elucidated by FiT-seq analysis correlate with known oncogenic drivers in different tissues and can assist in the understanding of how chromatin states affect gene regulation.","Cejas, Paloma;Li, Lewyn;O'Neill, Nicholas K;Duarte, Melissa;Rao, Prakash;Bowden, Michaela;Zhou, Chensheng W;Mendiola, Marta;Burgos, Emilio;Feliu, Jaime;Moreno-Rubio, Juan;Guadalajara, Héctor;Moreno, Víctor;García-Olmo, Damián;Bellmunt, Joaquim;Mullane, Stephanie;Hirsch, Michelle;Sweeney, Christopher J;Richardson, Andrea;Liu, X Shirley;Brown, Myles;Shivdasani, Ramesh A;Long, Henry W"
27111280,2016,Nature medicine,Two FOXP3(+)CD4(+) T cell subpopulations distinctly control the prognosis of colorectal cancers.,"CD4(+) T cells that express the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor function as regulatory T (Treg) cells and hinder effective immune responses against cancer cells. Abundant Treg cell infiltration into tumors is associated with poor clinical outcomes in various types of cancers. However, the role of Treg cells is controversial in colorectal cancers (CRCs), in which FOXP3(+) T cell infiltration indicated better prognosis in some studies. Here we show that CRCs, which are commonly infiltrated by suppression-competent FOXP3(hi) Treg cells, can be classified into two types by the degree of additional infiltration of FOXP3(lo) nonsuppressive T cells. The latter, which are distinguished from FOXP3(+) Treg cells by non-expression of the naive T cell marker CD45RA and instability of FOXP3, secreted inflammatory cytokines. Indeed, CRCs with abundant infiltration of FOXP3(lo) T cells showed significantly better prognosis than those with predominantly FOXP3(hi) Treg cell infiltration. Development of such inflammatory FOXP3(lo) non-Treg cells may depend on secretion of interleukin (IL)-12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β by tissues and their presence was correlated with tumor invasion by intestinal bacteria, especially Fusobacterium nucleatum. Thus, functionally distinct subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3(+) T cells contribute in opposing ways to determining CRC prognosis. Depletion of FOXP3(hi) Treg cells from tumor tissues, which would augment antitumor immunity, could thus be used as an effective treatment strategy for CRCs and other cancers, whereas strategies that locally increase the population of FOXP3(lo) non-Treg cells could be used to suppress or prevent tumor formation.","Saito, Takuro;Nishikawa, Hiroyoshi;Wada, Hisashi;Nagano, Yuji;Sugiyama, Daisuke;Atarashi, Koji;Maeda, Yuka;Hamaguchi, Masahide;Ohkura, Naganari;Sato, Eiichi;Nagase, Hirotsugu;Nishimura, Junichi;Yamamoto, Hirofumi;Takiguchi, Shuji;Tanoue, Takeshi;Suda, Wataru;Morita, Hidetoshi;Hattori, Masahira;Honda, Kenya;Mori, Masaki;Doki, Yuichiro;Sakaguchi, Shimon"

At present, it is not possible to predict which patients will be affected by doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). Here we demonstrate that patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can recapitulate the predilection to DIC of individual patients at the cellular level. hiPSC-CMs derived from individuals with breast cancer who experienced DIC were consistently more sensitive to doxorubicin toxicity than hiPSC-CMs from patients who did not experience DIC, with decreased cell viability, impaired mitochondrial and metabolic function, impaired calcium handling, decreased antioxidant pathway activity, and increased reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our data indicate that hiPSC-CMs are a suitable platform to identify and characterize the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of DIC.","Burridge, Paul W;Li, Yong Fuga;Matsa, Elena;Wu, Haodi;Ong, Sang-Ging;Sharma, Arun;Holmström, Alexandra;Chang, Alex C;Coronado, Michael J;Ebert, Antje D;Knowles, Joshua W;Telli, Melinda L;Witteles, Ronald M;Blau, Helen M;Bernstein, Daniel;Altman, Russ B;Wu, Joseph C"

We found that human PDACs with impaired epithelial transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling have high epithelial STAT3 activity and develop stiff, matricellular-enriched fibrosis associated with high epithelial tension and shorter patient survival. In several KRAS-driven mouse models, both the loss of TGF-β signaling and elevated β1-integrin mechanosignaling engaged a positive feedback loop whereby STAT3 signaling promotes tumor progression by increasing matricellular fibrosis and tissue tension. In contrast, epithelial STAT3 ablation attenuated tumor progression by reducing the stromal stiffening and epithelial contractility induced by loss of TGF-β signaling. In PDAC patient biopsies, higher matricellular protein and activated STAT3 were associated with SMAD4 mutation and shorter survival. The findings implicate epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis in the aggressiveness of SMAD4 mutant pancreatic tumors and highlight STAT3 and mechanics as key drivers of this phenotype.","Laklai, Hanane;Miroshnikova, Yekaterina A;Pickup, Michael W;Collisson, Eric A;Kim, Grace E;Barrett, Alex S;Hill, Ryan C;Lakins, Johnathon N;Schlaepfer, David D;Mouw, Janna K;LeBleu, Valerie S;Roy, Nilotpal;Novitskiy, Sergey V;Johansen, Julia S;Poli, Valeria;Kalluri, Raghu;Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A;Wood, Laura D;Hebrok, Matthias;Hansen, Kirk;Moses, Harold L;Weaver, Valerie M"
27043494,2016,Nature medicine,Epithelial calcineurin controls microbiota-dependent intestinal tumor development.,"Inflammation-associated pathways are active in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Calcineurin, a phosphatase required for the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, shows increased expression in CRC. We therefore investigated the role of calcineurin in intestinal tumor development. We demonstrate that calcineurin and NFAT factors are constitutively expressed by primary IECs and selectively activated in intestinal tumors as a result of impaired stratification of the tumor-associated microbiota and toll-like receptor signaling. Epithelial calcineurin supports the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells in an NFAT-dependent manner and promotes the development of intestinal tumors in mice. Moreover, somatic mutations that have been identified in human CRC are associated with constitutive activation of calcineurin, whereas nuclear translocation of NFAT is associated with increased death from CRC. These findings highlight an epithelial cell-intrinsic pathway that integrates signals derived from the commensal microbiota to promote intestinal tumor development.","Peuker, Kenneth;Muff, Stefanie;Wang, Jun;Künzel, Sven;Bosse, Esther;Zeissig, Yvonne;Luzzi, Giuseppina;Basic, Marijana;Strigli, Anne;Ulbricht, Andrea;Kaser, Arthur;Arlt, Alexander;Chavakis, Triantafyllos;van den Brink, Gijs R;Schafmayer, Clemens;Egberts, Jan-Hendrik;Becker, Thomas;Bianchi, Marco E;Bleich, André;Röcken, Christoph;Hampe, Jochen;Schreiber, Stefan;Baines, John F;Blumberg, Richard S;Zeissig, Sebastian"
27019329,2016,Nature medicine,ROR-γ drives androgen receptor expression and represents a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-γ antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity, in mice. Taken together, these results establish ROR-γ as a key player in CRPC by acting upstream of AR and as a potential therapeutic target for advanced PCa.","Wang, Junjian;Zou, June X;Xue, Xiaoqian;Cai, Demin;Zhang, Yan;Duan, Zhijian;Xiang, Qiuping;Yang, Joy C;Louie, Maggie C;Borowsky, Alexander D;Gao, Allen C;Evans, Christopher P;Lam, Kit S;Xu, Jianzhen;Kung, Hsing-Jien;Evans, Ronald M;Xu, Yong;Chen, Hong-Wu"
26974310,2016,Nature medicine,PTEN opposes negative selection and enables oncogenic transformation of pre-B cells.,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway and a potent tumor suppressor in many types of cancer. To test a tumor suppressive role for PTEN in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we induced Cre-mediated deletion of Pten in mouse models of pre-B ALL. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, loss of one or both alleles of Pten caused rapid cell death of pre-B ALL cells and was sufficient to clear transplant recipient mice of leukemia. Small-molecule inhibition of PTEN in human pre-B ALL cells resulted in hyperactivation of AKT, activation of the p53 tumor suppressor cell cycle checkpoint and cell death. Loss of PTEN function in pre-B ALL cells was functionally equivalent to acute activation of autoreactive pre-B cell receptor signaling, which engaged a deletional checkpoint for the removal of autoreactive B cells. We propose that targeted inhibition of PTEN and hyperactivation of AKT triggers a checkpoint for the elimination of autoreactive B cells and represents a new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.

We and others have shown that MYC alters metabolism during tumorigenesis. However, the role of MYC in TNBC metabolism remains mostly unexplored. We hypothesized that MYC-dependent metabolic dysregulation is essential for the growth of MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells and may identify new therapeutic targets for this clinically challenging subset of breast cancer. Using a targeted metabolomics approach, we identified fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates as being dramatically upregulated in a MYC-driven model of TNBC. We also identified a lipid metabolism gene signature in patients with TNBC that were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and from multiple other clinical data sets, implicating FAO as a dysregulated pathway that is critical for TNBC cell metabolism. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of FAO catastrophically decreased energy metabolism in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells and blocked tumor growth in a MYC-driven transgenic TNBC model and in a MYC-overexpressing TNBC patient-derived xenograft. These findings demonstrate that MYC-overexpressing TNBC shows an increased bioenergetic reliance on FAO and identify the inhibition of FAO as a potential therapeutic strategy for this subset of breast cancer.","Camarda, Roman;Zhou, Alicia Y;Kohnz, Rebecca A;Balakrishnan, Sanjeev;Mahieu, Celine;Anderton, Brittany;Eyob, Henok;Kajimura, Shingo;Tward, Aaron;Krings, Gregor;Nomura, Daniel K;Goga, Andrei"
26928463,2016,Nature medicine,Substantial interindividual and limited intraindividual genomic diversity among tumors from men with metastatic prostate cancer.,"Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals. In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations, the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR) activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins. Collectively, these data indicate that although exceptions exist, evaluating a single metastasis provides a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic driver alterations that are present in disseminated tumors within an individual, and thus may be useful for selecting treatments on the basis of predicted molecular vulnerabilities.

We recently reported that intratumoral expression of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor can guide the identification of the patient-specific repertoire of tumor-reactive CD8(+) lymphocytes that reside in the tumor. In view of these findings, we investigated whether PD-1 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes could be used as a biomarker to detect T cells that target neoantigens. By using a high-throughput personalized screening approach, we identified neoantigen-specific lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of three of four melanoma patients. Despite their low frequency in the circulation, we found that CD8(+)PD-1(+), but not CD8(+)PD-1(-), cell populations had lymphocytes that targeted 3, 3 and 1 unique, patient-specific neoantigens, respectively. We show that neoantigen-specific T cells and gene-engineered lymphocytes expressing neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from peripheral blood recognized autologous tumors. Notably, the tumor-antigen specificities and TCR repertoires of the circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8(+)PD-1(+) cells appeared similar, implying that the circulating CD8(+)PD-1(+) lymphocytes could provide a window into the tumor-resident antitumor lymphocytes. Thus, expression of PD-1 identifies a diverse and patient-specific antitumor T cell response in peripheral blood, providing a novel noninvasive strategy to develop personalized therapies using neoantigen-reactive lymphocytes or TCRs to treat cancer.","Gros, Alena;Parkhurst, Maria R;Tran, Eric;Pasetto, Anna;Robbins, Paul F;Ilyas, Sadia;Prickett, Todd D;Gartner, Jared J;Crystal, Jessica S;Roberts, Ilana M;Trebska-McGowan, Kasia;Wunderlich, John R;Yang, James C;Rosenberg, Steven A"
26855150,2016,Nature medicine,CYP3A5 mediates basal and acquired therapy resistance in different subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Although subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have been described, this malignancy is clinically still treated as a single disease. Here we present patient-derived models representing the full spectrum of previously identified quasi-mesenchymal (QM-PDA), classical and exocrine-like PDAC subtypes, and identify two markers--HNF1A and KRT81--that enable stratification of tumors into different subtypes by using immunohistochemistry. Individuals with tumors of these subtypes showed substantial differences in overall survival, and their tumors differed in drug sensitivity, with the exocrine-like subtype being resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and paclitaxel. Cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) metabolizes these compounds in tumors of the exocrine-like subtype, and pharmacological or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CYP3A5 inhibition sensitizes tumor cells to these drugs. Whereas hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha (HNF4A) controls basal expression of CYP3A5, drug-induced CYP3A5 upregulation is mediated by the nuclear receptor NR1I2. CYP3A5 also contributes to acquired drug resistance in QM-PDA and classical PDAC, and it is highly expressed in several additional malignancies. These findings designate CYP3A5 as a predictor of therapy response and as a tumor cell-autonomous detoxification mechanism that must be overcome to prevent drug resistance.","Noll, Elisa M;Eisen, Christian;Stenzinger, Albrecht;Espinet, Elisa;Muckenhuber, Alexander;Klein, Corinna;Vogel, Vanessa;Klaus, Bernd;Nadler, Wiebke;Rösli, Christoph;Lutz, Christian;Kulke, Michael;Engelhardt, Jan;Zickgraf, Franziska M;Espinosa, Octavio;Schlesner, Matthias;Jiang, Xiaoqi;Kopp-Schneider, Annette;Neuhaus, Peter;Bahra, Marcus;Sinn, Bruno V;Eils, Roland;Giese, Nathalia A;Hackert, Thilo;Strobel, Oliver;Werner, Jens;Büchler, Markus W;Weichert, Wilko;Trumpp, Andreas;Sprick, Martin R"

We reasoned that the identification of mediators of Kras signaling in early mouse lung hyperplasias might bypass the difficulties that are imposed by intratumor heterogeneity in advanced tumors, and that it might unveil relevant therapeutic targets. Transcriptional profiling of Kras(G12V)-driven mouse hyperplasias revealed intertumor diversity with a subset that exhibited an aggressive transcriptional profile analogous to that of advanced human adenocarcinomas. The top-scoring gene in this profile encodes the tyrosine kinase receptor DDR1. The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 blocked tumor initiation and tumor progression, respectively. The concomitant inhibition of both DDR1 and Notch signaling induced the regression of KRAS;TP53-mutant patient-derived lung xenografts (PDX) with a therapeutic efficacy that was at least comparable to that of standard chemotherapy.

The etiology and molecular basis for this 'alternative' treatment-resistant cell state remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data of metastatic biopsies from patients, we observed substantial genomic overlap between castration-resistant tumors that were histologically characterized as prostate adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE); analysis of biopsy samples from the same individuals over time points to a model most consistent with divergent clonal evolution. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed marked epigenetic differences between CRPC-NE tumors and CRPC-Adeno, and also designated samples of CRPC-Adeno with clinical features of AR independence as CRPC-NE, suggesting that epigenetic modifiers may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of this treatment-resistant state. This study supports the emergence of an alternative, 'AR-indifferent' cell state through divergent clonal evolution as a mechanism of treatment resistance in advanced prostate cancer.

Notably, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations occur in cancers but are associated with distinct cancer types. Here we review the spectrum of EZH2-associated mutations, discuss the mechanisms underlying EZH2 function, and synthesize a unifying perspective that the promotion of cancer arises from disruption of the role of EZH2 as a master regulator of transcription. We further discuss EZH2 inhibitors that are now showing early signs of promise in clinical trials and also additional strategies to combat roles of EZH2 in cancer.

Here we observe that acquired resistance caused by the EGFR(T790M) gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing EGFR(T790M)-positive clones or via genetic evolution of initially EGFR(T790M)-negative drug-tolerant cells. The path to resistance impacts the biology of the resistant clone, as those that evolved from drug-tolerant cells had a diminished apoptotic response to third-generation EGFR inhibitors that target EGFR(T790M); treatment with navitoclax, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic factors BCL-xL and BCL-2 restored sensitivity. We corroborated these findings using cultures derived directly from EGFR inhibitor-resistant patient tumors. These findings provide evidence that clinically relevant drug-resistant cancer cells can both pre-exist and evolve from drug-tolerant cells, and they point to therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome resistance in the clinic.

26779812,2016,Nature medicine,Blocking c-Met-mediated PARP1 phosphorylation enhances anti-tumor effects of PARP inhibitors.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutics for many diseases, including cancer, in clinical trials. One PARP inhibitor, olaparib (Lynparza, AstraZeneca), was recently approved by the FDA to treat ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA genes. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have essential roles in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, and a deficiency of BRCA proteins sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibition. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met associates with and phosphorylates PARP1 at Tyr907 (PARP1 pTyr907 or pY907). PARP1 pY907 increases PARP1 enzymatic activity and reduces binding to a PARP inhibitor, thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to PARP inhibition. The combination of c-Met and PARP1 inhibitors synergized to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and xenograft tumor models, and we observed similar synergistic effects in a lung cancer xenograft tumor model.

26735408,2016,Nature medicine,Prospects for gene-engineered T cell immunotherapy for solid cancers.,"Adoptive transfer of receptor-engineered T cells has produced impressive results in treating patients with B cell leukemias and lymphomas. This success has captured public imagination and driven academic and industrial researchers to develop similar 'off-the-shelf' receptors targeting shared antigens on epithelial cancers, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. However, the successful treatment of large numbers of people with solid cancers using this strategy is unlikely to be straightforward. Receptor-engineered T cells have the potential to cause lethal toxicity from on-target recognition of normal tissues, and there is a paucity of truly tumor-specific antigens shared across tumor types. Here we offer our perspective on how expanding the use of genetically redirected T cells to treat the majority of patients with solid cancers will require major technical, manufacturing and regulatory innovations centered around the development of autologous gene therapies targeting private somatic mutations.

26657142,2016,Nature medicine,Systematic discovery of complex insertions and deletions in human cancers.,"Complex insertions and deletions (indels) are formed by simultaneously deleting and inserting DNA fragments of different sizes at a common genomic location. Here we present a systematic analysis of somatic complex indels in the coding sequences of samples from over 8,000 cancer cases using Pindel-C. We discovered 285 complex indels in cancer-associated genes (such as PIK3R1, TP53, ARID1A, GATA3 and KMT2D) in approximately 3.5% of cases analyzed; nearly all instances of complex indels were overlooked (81.1%) or misannotated (17.6%) in previous reports of 2,199 samples. In-frame complex indels are enriched in PIK3R1 and EGFR, whereas frameshifts are prevalent in VHL, GATA3, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN and ATRX. Furthermore, complex indels display strong tissue specificity (such as VHL in kidney cancer samples and GATA3 in breast cancer samples). Finally, structural analyses support findings of previously missed, but potentially druggable, mutations in the EGFR, MET and KIT oncogenes. This study indicates the critical importance of improving complex indel discovery and interpretation in medical research.

26618723,2016,Nature medicine,Pan-cancer analysis of the extent and consequences of intratumor heterogeneity.,"Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) drives neoplastic progression and therapeutic resistance. We used the bioinformatics tools 'expanding ploidy and allele frequency on nested subpopulations' (EXPANDS) and PyClone to detect clones that are present at a ≥10% frequency in 1,165 exome sequences from tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas. 86% of tumors across 12 cancer types had at least two clones. ITH in the morphology of nuclei was associated with genetic ITH (Spearman's correlation coefficient, ρ = 0.24-0.41; P < 0.001). Mutation of a driver gene that typically appears in smaller clones was a survival risk factor (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-2.69). The risk of mortality also increased when >2 clones coexisted in the same tumor sample (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.20-1.87). In two independent data sets, copy-number alterations affecting either <25% or >75% of a tumor's genome predicted reduced risk (HR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.08-0.29). Mortality risk also declined when >4 clones coexisted in the sample, suggesting a trade-off between the costs and benefits of genomic instability. ITH and genomic instability thus have the potential to be useful measures that can universally be applied to all cancers.

26594843,2015,Nature medicine,Synthetic lethal targeting of oncogenic transcription factors in acute leukemia by PARP inhibitors.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly driven by oncogenic transcription factors, which have been classically viewed as intractable targets using small-molecule inhibitor approaches. Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARα fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A) fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to AML1-ETO and PML-RARα transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML.

26552009,2015,Nature medicine,SWI/SNF-mutant cancers depend on catalytic and non-catalytic activity of EZH2.,"Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to have bona fide tumor suppressor activity. However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity. These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of EZH2.

26540387,2015,Nature medicine,The emerging role of lncRNAs in cancer.,"It is increasingly evident that many of the genomic mutations in cancer reside inside regions that do not encode proteins. However, these regions are often transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). The recent application of next-generation sequencing to a growing number of cancer transcriptomes has indeed revealed thousands of lncRNAs whose aberrant expression is associated with different cancer types. Among the few that have been functionally characterized, several have been linked to malignant transformation. Notably, these lncRNAs have key roles in gene regulation and thus affect various aspects of cellular homeostasis, including proliferation, survival, migration or genomic stability. This review aims to summarize current knowledge of lncRNAs from the cancer perspective. It discusses the strategies that led to the identification of cancer-related lncRNAs and the methodologies and challenges involving the study of these molecules, as well as the imminent applications of these findings to the clinic.","Huarte, Maite"
26523969,2015,Nature medicine,Evolution of metastasis revealed by mutational landscapes of chemically induced skin cancers.,"Human tumors show a high level of genetic heterogeneity, but the processes that influence the timing and route of metastatic dissemination of the subclones are unknown. Here we have used whole-exome sequencing of 103 matched benign, malignant and metastatic skin tumors from genetically heterogeneous mice to demonstrate that most metastases disseminate synchronously from the primary tumor, supporting parallel rather than linear evolution as the predominant model of metastasis. Shared mutations between primary carcinomas and their matched metastases have the distinct A-to-T signature of the initiating carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene, but non-shared mutations are primarily G-to-T, a signature associated with oxidative stress. The existence of carcinomas that either did or did not metastasize in the same host animal suggests that there are tumor-intrinsic factors that influence metastatic seeding. We also demonstrate the importance of germline polymorphisms in determining allele-specific mutations, and we identify somatic genetic alterations that are specifically related to initiation of carcinogenesis by Hras or Kras mutations. Mouse tumors that mimic the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers can aid our understanding of the clonal evolution of metastasis and provide a realistic model for the testing of novel therapies.

We establish three-dimensional culture conditions to induce the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into exocrine progenitor organoids that form ductal and acinar structures in culture and in vivo. Expression of mutant KRAS or TP53 in progenitor organoids induces mutation-specific phenotypes in culture and in vivo. Expression of TP53(R175H) induces cytosolic SOX9 localization. In patient tumors bearing TP53 mutations, SOX9 was cytoplasmic and associated with mortality. We also define culture conditions for clonal generation of tumor organoids from freshly resected PDAC. Tumor organoids maintain the differentiation status, histoarchitecture and phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and retain patient-specific physiological changes, including hypoxia, oxygen consumption, epigenetic marks and differences in sensitivity to inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Thus, pancreatic progenitor organoids and tumor organoids can be used to model PDAC and for drug screening to identify precision therapy strategies.

With these PDXs, we performed in vivo compound screens using a 1 × 1 × 1 experimental design (PDX clinical trial or PCT) to assess the population responses to 62 treatments across six indications. We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We therefore propose that this experimental paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of treatment modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial responses.

26479922,2015,Nature medicine,Hair follicle-derived IL-7 and IL-15 mediate skin-resident memory T cell homeostasis and lymphoma.,"The skin harbors a variety of resident leukocyte subsets that must be tightly regulated to maintain immune homeostasis. Hair follicles are unique structures in the skin that contribute to skin dendritic cell homeostasis through chemokine production. We demonstrate that CD4(+) and CD8(+) skin-resident memory T cells (TRM cells), which are responsible for long-term skin immunity, reside predominantly within the hair follicle epithelium of the unperturbed epidermis. TRM cell tropism for the epidermis and follicles is herein termed epidermotropism. Hair follicle expression of IL-15 was required for CD8(+) TRM cells, and IL-7 for CD8(+) and CD4(+) TRM cells, to exert epidermotropism. A lack of either cytokine in the skin led to impaired hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity responses. In a model of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, epidermotropic CD4(+) TRM lymphoma cell localization depended on the presence of hair follicle-derived IL-7. These findings implicate hair follicle-derived cytokines as regulators of malignant and non-malignant TRM cell tissue residence, and they suggest that the cytokines may be targeted therapeutically in inflammatory skin diseases and lymphoma.

26479921,2015,Nature medicine,Selective inhibition of the p38 alternative activation pathway in infiltrating T cells inhibits pancreatic cancer progression.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm characterized by a marked fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, the presence of which can promote both cancer induction and growth. Therefore, selective manipulation of local cytokines is an attractive, although unrealized, therapeutic approach. T cells possess a unique mechanism of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement through the phosphorylation of Tyr323 (pY323). This alternative p38 activation pathway is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Here we show in human PDAC that a high percentage of infiltrating pY323(+) T cells was associated with large numbers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and aggressive disease. The growth of mouse pancreatic tumors was inhibited by genetic ablation of the alternative p38 pathway, and transfer of wild-type CD4(+) T cells, but not those lacking the alternative pathway, enhanced tumor growth in T cell-deficient mice. Notably, a plasma membrane-permeable peptide derived from GADD45-α, the naturally occurring inhibitor of p38 pY323(+) (ref. 7), reduced CD4(+) TIL production of TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-10 and secondary cytokines, halted growth of implanted tumors and inhibited progression of spontaneous KRAS-driven adenocarcinoma in mice. Thus, TCR-mediated activation of CD4(+) TILs results in alternative p38 activation and production of protumorigenic factors and can be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

26457758,2015,Nature medicine,Excess TGF-β mediates muscle weakness associated with bone metastases in mice.,"Cancer-associated muscle weakness is a poorly understood phenomenon, and there is no effective treatment. Here we find that seven different mouse models of human osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers, as well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, released from the bone surface as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-β signaling, TGF-β release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated with increased TGF-β activity. Thus, pathological TGF-β release from bone contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force production.

26444637,2015,Nature medicine,Natural and therapy-induced immunosurveillance in breast cancer.,"The immunosurveillance theory postulates that tumors evolve and progress in an uncontrolled fashion only when anticancer immune responses fail. Natural immunosurveillance clearly influences human breast cancer (BC) progression because the prognosis of BC patients is dictated by the density, composition and activity of the tumor immune infiltrate at diagnosis. Moreover, chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic regimens commonly employed for the treatment of BC affect the tumor immune infiltrate, and accumulating data suggest that the clinical efficacy of these treatments is largely determined by T cell-dependent tumor-specific immune responses. In addition, the mechanism of action of targeted anticancer therapeutics, such as the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2)-targeting agent trastuzumab, involves the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. In this Review, we discuss these findings as well as preliminary evidence indicating that immunotherapy constitutes a promising option for the treatment of BC. Moreover, we point out that the successful implementation of immunotherapy to BC management requires the optimization of current immunotherapeutic regimens and the identification of immunological biomarkers that enable improved risk stratification and the design of personalized, dynamic treatment plans.

Here we describe a general pipeline in which candidate functional SNPs are first evaluated by fine mapping, epigenomic profiling, and epigenome editing, and then interrogated for causal function by using genome editing to create isogenic cell lines followed by phenotypic characterization. To validate this approach, we analyzed the 6q22.1 prostate cancer risk locus and identified rs339331 as the top-scoring SNP. Epigenome editing confirmed that the rs339331 region possessed regulatory potential. By using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome editing, we created a panel of isogenic 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines representing all three genotypes (TT, TC, CC) at rs339331. Introduction of the 'T' risk allele increased transcription of the regulatory factor 6 (RFX6) gene, increased homeobox B13 (HOXB13) binding at the rs339331 region, and increased deposition of the enhancer-associated H3K4me2 histone mark at the rs339331 region compared to lines homozygous for the 'C' protective allele. The cell lines also differed in cellular morphology and adhesion, and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested an influence of androgens.

Mechanistically, inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL induces a metabolic shutdown, with prominent inhibition of glutaminolysis and triggers autophagy as a salvage pathway supporting leukemia cell metabolism. Consequently, inhibition of glutaminolysis and inhibition of autophagy strongly and synergistically enhance the antileukemic effects of anti-NOTCH1 therapy in mice harboring T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pten loss upregulates glycolysis and consequently rescues leukemic cell metabolism, thereby abrogating the antileukemic effects of NOTCH1 inhibition.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA synergizes with JQ1 to augment cell death and more potently suppress advanced PDAC. Finally, using a CRISPR-Cas9-based method for gene editing directly in the mouse adult pancreas, we show that de-repression of p57 (also known as KIP2 or CDKN1C) upon combined BET and HDAC inhibition is required for the induction of combination therapy-induced cell death in PDAC. SAHA is approved for human use, and molecules similar to JQ1 are being tested in clinical trials.

However, the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.

Notably, other KMT2D target genes include frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes such as TNFAIP3, SOCS3 and TNFRSF14.

26343801,2015,Nature medicine,Minimal PU.1 reduction induces a preleukemic state and promotes development of acute myeloid leukemia.,"Modest transcriptional changes caused by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms are frequent in human cancer. Although loss or near-complete loss of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35% reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells in AML.

26322579,2015,Nature medicine,CD47 blockade triggers T cell-mediated destruction of immunogenic tumors.,"Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells mediated by CD47-specific blocking antibodies has been proposed to be the major effector mechanism in xenograft models. Here, using syngeneic immunocompetent mouse tumor models, we reveal that the therapeutic effects of CD47 blockade depend on dendritic cell but not macrophage cross-priming of T cell responses. The therapeutic effects of anti-CD47 antibody therapy were abrogated in T cell-deficient mice. In addition, the antitumor effects of CD47 blockade required expression of the cytosolic DNA sensor STING, but neither MyD88 nor TRIF, in CD11c+ cells, suggesting that cytosolic sensing of DNA from tumor cells is enhanced by anti-CD47 treatment, further bridging the innate and adaptive responses. Notably, the timing of administration of standard chemotherapy markedly impacted the induction of antitumor T cell responses by CD47 blockade. Together, our findings indicate that CD47 blockade drives T cell-mediated elimination of immunogenic tumors.","Liu, Xiaojuan;Pu, Yang;Cron, Kyle;Deng, Liufu;Kline, Justin;Frazier, William A;Xu, Hairong;Peng, Hua;Fu, Yang-Xin;Xu, Meng Michelle"
26301689,2015,Nature medicine,RAS-MAPK dependence underlies a rational polytherapy strategy in EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer.,"One strategy for combating cancer-drug resistance is to deploy rational polytherapy up front that suppresses the survival and emergence of resistant tumor cells. Here we demonstrate in models of lung adenocarcinoma harboring the oncogenic fusion of ALK and EML4 that the GTPase RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for tumor-cell survival. EML4-ALK activated RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three major RAS isoforms through the HELP domain of EML4. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway via either a gain in the number of copies of the gene encoding wild-type K-RAS (KRAS(WT)) or decreased expression of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted resistance to ALK inhibitors in vitro, and each was associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors in individuals with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Upfront inhibition of both ALK and the kinase MEK enhanced both the magnitude and duration of the initial response in preclinical models of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings identify RAS-MAPK dependence as a hallmark of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma and provide a rationale for the upfront inhibition of both ALK and MEK to forestall resistance and improve patient outcomes.

26280119,2015,Nature medicine,Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein co-stimulation facilitates tumor regression by inducing IL-9-producing helper T cells.,"T cell stimulation via glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-related protein (GITR) elicits antitumor activity in various tumor models; however, the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we demonstrate a crucial role for interleukin (IL)-9 in antitumor immunity generated by the GITR agonistic antibody DTA-1. IL-4 receptor knockout (Il4ra(-/-)) mice, which have reduced expression of IL-9, were resistant to tumor growth inhibition by DTA-1. Notably, neutralization of IL-9 considerably impaired tumor rejection induced by DTA-1. In particular, DTA-1-induced IL-9 promoted tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses by enhancing the function of dendritic cells in vivo. Furthermore, GITR signaling enhanced the differentiation of IL-9-producing CD4(+) T-helper (TH9) cells in a TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)- and NF-κB-dependent manner and inhibited the generation of induced regulatory T cells in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that GITR co-stimulation mediates antitumor immunity by promoting TH9 cell differentiation and enhancing CTL responses and thus provide a mechanism of action for GITR agonist-mediated cancer immunotherapies.

26259033,2015,Nature medicine,Retrotransposon insertions in the clonal evolution of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed after the disease has metastasized; it is among the most lethal forms of cancer. We recently described aberrant expression of an open reading frame 1 protein, ORF1p, encoded by long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1; L1) retrotransposon, in PDAC. To test whether LINE-1 expression leads to somatic insertions of this mobile DNA, we used a targeted method to sequence LINE-1 insertion sites in matched PDAC and normal samples. We found evidence of 465 somatic LINE-1 insertions in 20 PDAC genomes, which were absent from corresponding normal samples. In cases in which matched normal tissue, primary PDAC and metastatic disease sites were available, insertions were found in primary and metastatic tissues in differing proportions. Two adenocarcinomas secondarily involving the pancreas, but originating in the stomach and duodenum, acquired insertions with a similar discordance between primary and metastatic sites. Together, our findings show that LINE-1 contributes to the genetic evolution of PDAC and suggest that somatic insertions are acquired discontinuously in gastrointestinal neoplasms.

Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive MM received an average 2.4 × 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded, persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 19.1 months. NY-ESO-1-LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T cells were safe, trafficked to marrow and showed extended persistence that correlated with clinical activity against antigen-positive myeloma.

26193343,2015,Nature medicine,Targeting B cell receptor signaling with ibrutinib in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.,"The two major subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)--activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB)--arise by distinct mechanisms, with ABC selectively acquiring mutations that target the B cell receptor (BCR), fostering chronic active BCR signaling. The ABC subtype has a ∼40% cure rate with currently available therapies, which is worse than the rate for GCB DLBCL, and highlights the need for ABC subtype-specific treatment strategies. We hypothesized that ABC, but not GCB, DLBCL tumors would respond to ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BCR signaling. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial that involved 80 subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, ibrutinib produced complete or partial responses in 37% (14/38) of those with ABC DLBCL, but in only 5% (1/20) of subjects with GCB DLBCL (P = 0.0106). ABC tumors with BCR mutations responded to ibrutinib frequently (5/9; 55.5%), especially those with concomitant myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations (4/5; 80%), a result that is consistent with in vitro cooperation between the BCR and MYD88 pathways. However, the highest number of responses occurred in ABC tumors that lacked BCR mutations (9/29; 31%), suggesting that oncogenic BCR signaling in ABC does not require BCR mutations and might be initiated by non-genetic mechanisms. These results support the selective development of ibrutinib for the treatment of ABC DLBCL.","Wilson, Wyndham H;Young, Ryan M;Schmitz, Roland;Yang, Yandan;Pittaluga, Stefania;Wright, George;Lih, Chih-Jian;Williams, P Mickey;Shaffer, Arthur L;Gerecitano, John;de Vos, Sven;Goy, Andre;Kenkre, Vaishalee P;Barr, Paul M;Blum, Kristie A;Shustov, Andrei;Advani, Ranjana;Fowler, Nathan H;Vose, Julie M;Elstrom, Rebecca L;Habermann, Thomas M;Barrientos, Jacqueline C;McGreivy, Jesse;Fardis, Maria;Chang, Betty Y;Clow, Fong;Munneke, Brian;Moussa, Davina;Beaupre, Darrin M;Staudt, Louis M"
26193342,2015,Nature medicine,The prognostic landscape of genes and infiltrating immune cells across human cancers.,"Molecular profiles of tumors and tumor-associated cells hold great promise as biomarkers of clinical outcomes. However, existing data sets are fragmented and difficult to analyze systematically. Here we present a pan-cancer resource and meta-analysis of expression signatures from ∼18,000 human tumors with overall survival outcomes across 39 malignancies. By using this resource, we identified a forkhead box MI (FOXM1) regulatory network as a major predictor of adverse outcomes, and we found that expression of favorably prognostic genes, including KLRB1 (encoding CD161), largely reflect tumor-associated leukocytes. By applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival. For example, tumor-associated neutrophil and plasma cell signatures emerged as significant but opposite predictors of survival for diverse solid tumors, including breast and lung adenocarcinomas. This resource and associated analytical tools (http://precog.stanford.edu) may help delineate prognostic genes and leukocyte subsets within and across cancers, shed light on the impact of tumor heterogeneity on cancer outcomes, and facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

26168295,2015,Nature medicine,Detection of colorectal polyps in humans using an intravenously administered fluorescent peptide targeted against c-Met.,"Colon cancer prevention currently relies on colonoscopy using white light to detect and remove polyps, but small and flat polyps are difficult to detect and frequently missed when using this technique. Fluorescence colonoscopy combined with a fluorescent probe specific for a polyp biomarker may improve polyp detection. Here we describe GE-137, a water-soluble probe consisting of a 26-amino acid cyclic peptide that binds the human tyrosine kinase c-Met conjugated to a fluorescent cyanine dye. Intravenous administration of GE-137 leads to its accumulation specifically in c-Met-expressing tumors in mice, and it is safe and well tolerated in humans. Fluorescence colonoscopy in patients receiving intravenous GE-137 enabled visualization of all neoplastic polyps that were visible with white light (38), as well as an additional nine polyps that were not visible with white light. This first-in-human pilot study shows that molecular imaging using an intravenous fluorescent agent specific for c-Met is feasible and safe, and that it may enable the detection of polyps missed by other techniques.

26168291,2015,Nature medicine,Genomic landscape of carcinogen-induced and genetically induced mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma.,"Mouse models of cancers are routinely used to study cancer biology. However, it remains unclear whether carcinogenesis in mice is driven by the same spectrum of genomic alterations found in humans. Here we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA)-induced skin cancer, the most commonly used skin cancer model, which appears as benign papillomas that progress into squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We also studied genetically induced SCCs that expressed G12D mutant Kras (Kras G12D) but were deficient for p53. Using whole-exome sequencing, we uncovered a characteristic mutational signature of DMBA-induced SCCs. We found that the vast majority of DMBA-induced SCCs presented recurrent mutations in Hras, Kras or Rras2 and mutations in several additional putative oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Similar genes were recurrently mutated in mouse and human SCCs that were from different organs or had been exposed to different carcinogens. Invasive SCCs, but not papillomas, presented substantial chromosomal aberrations, especially in DMBA-induced and genetically induced Trp53-mutated SCCs. Metastasis occurred through sequential spreading, with relatively few additional genetic events. This study provides a framework for future functional cancer genomic studies in mice.

26107252,2015,Nature medicine,Inflammasome-independent role of AIM2 in suppressing colon tumorigenesis via DNA-PK and Akt.,"The inflammasome activates caspase-1 and the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, and several inflammasomes protect against intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in animal models. The absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome is activated by double-stranded DNA, and AIM2 expression is reduced in several types of cancer, but the mechanism by which AIM2 restricts tumor growth remains unclear. We found that Aim2-deficient mice had greater tumor load than Asc-deficient mice in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colorectal cancer. Tumor burden was also higher in Aim2(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) than in APC(Min/+) mice. The effects of AIM2 on CAC were independent of inflammasome activation and IL-1β and were primarily mediated by a non-bone marrow source of AIM2. In resting cells, AIM2 physically interacted with and limited activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a PI3K-related family member that promotes Akt phosphorylation, whereas loss of AIM2 promoted DNA-PK-mediated Akt activation. AIM2 reduced Akt activation and tumor burden in colorectal cancer models, while an Akt inhibitor reduced tumor load in Aim2(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that Akt inhibitors could be used to treat AIM2-deficient human cancers.

To understand the subclonal structure of primary breast cancer, we applied whole-genome and targeted sequencing to multiple samples from each of 50 patients' tumors (303 samples in total). The extent of subclonal diversification varied among cases and followed spatial patterns. No strict temporal order was evident, with point mutations and rearrangements affecting the most common breast cancer genes, including PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, BRCA2 and MYC, occurring early in some tumors and late in others. In 13 out of 50 cancers, potentially targetable mutations were subclonal. Landmarks of disease progression, such as resistance to chemotherapy and the acquisition of invasive or metastatic potential, arose within detectable subclones of antecedent lesions. These findings highlight the importance of including analyses of subclonal structure and tumor evolution in clinical trials of primary breast cancer.

26030179,2015,Nature medicine,Clonal evolution and resistance to EGFR blockade in the blood of colorectal cancer patients.,"Colorectal cancers (CRCs) evolve by a reiterative process of genetic diversification and clonal evolution. The molecular profile of CRC is routinely assessed in surgical or bioptic samples. Genotyping of CRC tissue has inherent limitations; a tissue sample represents a single snapshot in time, and it is subjected to spatial selection bias owing to tumor heterogeneity. Repeated tissue samples are difficult to obtain and cannot be used for dynamic monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy. We exploited circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to genotype colorectal tumors and track clonal evolution during treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. We identified alterations in ctDNA of patients with primary or acquired resistance to EGFR blockade in the following genes: KRAS, NRAS, MET, ERBB2, FLT3, EGFR and MAP2K1. Mutated KRAS clones, which emerge in blood during EGFR blockade, decline upon withdrawal of EGFR-specific antibodies, indicating that clonal evolution continues beyond clinical progression. Pharmacogenomic analysis of CRC cells that had acquired resistance to cetuximab reveals that upon antibody withdrawal KRAS clones decay, whereas the population regains drug sensitivity. ctDNA profiles of individuals who benefit from multiple challenges with anti-EGFR antibodies exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS. These results indicate that the CRC genome adapts dynamically to intermittent drug schedules and provide a molecular explanation for the efficacy of rechallenge therapies based on EGFR blockade.

Here we study the contribution of epigenetic changes to the dissemination process by analyzing the changes that occur at the DNA methylation level between primary cancer cells and metastases. We found a hypomethylation event that reactivates a cryptic transcript of the Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D16 (TBC1D16-47 kDa; referred to hereafter as TBC1D16-47KD) to be a characteristic feature of the metastatic cascade. This short isoform of TBC1D16 exacerbates melanoma growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. By combining immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified RAB5C as a new TBC1D16 target and showed that it regulates EGFR in melanoma cells. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

26005854,2015,Nature medicine,The Cyclophilin A-CD147 complex promotes the proliferation and homing of multiple myeloma cells.,"B cell malignancies frequently colonize the bone marrow. The mechanisms responsible for this preferential homing are incompletely understood. Here we studied multiple myeloma (MM) as a model of a terminally differentiated B cell malignancy that selectively colonizes the bone marrow. We found that extracellular CyPA (eCyPA), secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs), promoted the colonization and proliferation of MM cells in an in vivo scaffold system via binding to its receptor, CD147, on MM cells. The expression and secretion of eCyPA by BMECs was enhanced by BCL9, a Wnt-β-catenin transcriptional coactivator that is selectively expressed by these cells. eCyPA levels were higher in bone marrow serum than in peripheral blood in individuals with MM, and eCyPA-CD147 blockade suppressed MM colonization and tumor growth in the in vivo scaffold system. eCyPA also promoted the migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells, two other B cell malignancies that colonize the bone marrow and express CD147. These findings suggest that eCyPA-CD147 signaling promotes the bone marrow homing of B cell malignancies and offer a compelling rationale for exploring this axis as a therapeutic target for these malignancies.

Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.

25939063,2015,Nature medicine,4-1BB costimulation ameliorates T cell exhaustion induced by tonic signaling of chimeric antigen receptors.,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have mediated dramatic antitumor responses in hematologic malignancies, but tumor regression has rarely occurred using CARs targeting other antigens. It remains unknown whether the impressive effects of CD19 CARs relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to CAR therapies, or superior functionality of the CD19 CAR itself. We show that tonic CAR CD3-ζ phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering of CAR single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of CAR T cells that limits antitumor efficacy. Such activation is present to varying degrees in all CARs studied, except the highly effective CD19 CAR. We further determine that CD28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1BB costimulation reduces, exhaustion induced by persistent CAR signaling. Our results provide biological explanations for the antitumor effects of CD19 CARs and for the observations that CD19 CAR T cells incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory domain are more persistent than those incorporating CD28 in clinical trials.

We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.

25894828,2015,Nature medicine,Molecular analysis of gastric cancer identifies subtypes associated with distinct clinical outcomes.,"Gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, is a heterogeneous disease. We aim to establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes that would encompass this heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We use gene expression data to describe four molecular subtypes linked to distinct patterns of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis. The mesenchymal-like type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (63%) of the four subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the lowest frequency of recurrence (22%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein 53 (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical translational research.

25849135,2015,Nature medicine,Active Pin1 is a key target of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer.,"A common key regulator of oncogenic signaling pathways in multiple tumor types is the unique isomerase Pin1. However, available Pin1 inhibitors lack the required specificity and potency for inhibiting Pin1 function in vivo. By using mechanism-based screening, here we find that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)--a therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that is considered the first example of targeted therapy in cancer, but whose drug target remains elusive--inhibits and degrades active Pin1 selectively in cancer cells by directly binding to the substrate phosphate- and proline-binding pockets in the Pin1 active site. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation degrades the protein encoded by the fusion oncogene PML-RARA and treats APL in APL cell and animal models as well as in human patients. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation also potently inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell growth in human cells and in animal models by acting on many Pin1 substrate oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Thus, ATRA simultaneously blocks multiple Pin1-regulated cancer-driving pathways, an attractive property for treating aggressive and drug-resistant tumors.","Wei, Shuo;Kozono, Shingo;Kats, Lev;Nechama, Morris;Li, Wenzong;Guarnerio, Jlenia;Luo, Manli;You, Mi-Hyeon;Yao, Yandan;Kondo, Asami;Hu, Hai;Bozkurt, Gunes;Moerke, Nathan J;Cao, Shugeng;Reschke, Markus;Chen, Chun-Hau;Rego, Eduardo M;Lo-Coco, Francesco;Cantley, Lewis C;Lee, Tae Ho;Wu, Hao;Zhang, Yan;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo;Zhou, Xiao Zhen;Lu, Kun Ping"
25849130,2015,Nature medicine,Studying clonal dynamics in response to cancer therapy using high-complexity barcoding.,"Resistance to cancer therapies presents a significant clinical challenge. Recent studies have revealed intratumoral heterogeneity as a source of therapeutic resistance. However, it is unclear whether resistance is driven predominantly by pre-existing or de novo alterations, in part because of the resolution limits of next-generation sequencing. To address this, we developed a high-complexity barcode library, ClonTracer, which enables the high-resolution tracking of more than 1 million cancer cells under drug treatment. In two clinically relevant models, ClonTracer studies showed that the majority of resistant clones were part of small, pre-existing subpopulations that selectively escaped under therapeutic challenge. Moreover, the ClonTracer approach enabled quantitative assessment of the ability of combination treatments to suppress resistant clones. These findings suggest that resistant clones are present before treatment, which would make up-front therapeutic combinations that target non-overlapping resistance a preferred approach. Thus, ClonTracer barcoding may be a valuable tool for optimizing therapeutic regimens with the goal of curative combination therapies for cancer.

25822367,2015,Nature medicine,Targeting the MLL complex in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Resistance to androgen deprivation therapies and increased androgen receptor (AR) activity are major drivers of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although prior work has focused on targeting AR directly, co-activators of AR signaling, which may represent new therapeutic targets, are relatively underexplored. Here we demonstrate that the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) complex, a well-known driver of MLL fusion-positive leukemia, acts as a co-activator of AR signaling. AR directly interacts with the MLL complex via the menin-MLL subunit. Menin expression is higher in CRPC than in both hormone-naive prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue, and high menin expression correlates with poor overall survival of individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of menin-MLL interaction blocks AR signaling and inhibits the growth of castration-resistant tumors in vivo in mice. Taken together, this work identifies the MLL complex as a crucial co-activator of AR and a potential therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.

25822366,2015,Nature medicine,DOT1L inhibits SIRT1-mediated epigenetic silencing to maintain leukemic gene expression in MLL-rearranged leukemia.,"Rearrangements of MLL (encoding lysine-specific methyltransferase 2A and officially known as KMT2A; herein referred to as MLL to denote the gene associated with mixed-lineage leukemia) generate MLL fusion proteins that bind DNA and drive leukemogenic gene expression. This gene expression program is dependent on the disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L, and small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors show promise as therapeutics for these leukemias. However, the mechanisms underlying this dependency are unclear. We conducted a genome-scale RNAi screen and found that the histone deacetylase SIRT1 is required for the establishment of a heterochromatin-like state around MLL fusion target genes after DOT1L inhibition. DOT1L inhibits chromatin localization of a repressive complex composed of SIRT1 and the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1, thereby maintaining an open chromatin state with elevated H3K9 acetylation and minimal H3K9 methylation at MLL fusion target genes. Furthermore, the combination of SIRT1 activators and DOT1L inhibitors shows enhanced antiproliferative activity against MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between chromatin regulators controlling the activation and repression of gene expression could provide novel opportunities for combination therapy.

25706875,2015,Nature medicine,Modeling colorectal cancer using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of human intestinal organoids.,"Human colorectal tumors bear recurrent mutations in genes encoding proteins operative in the WNT, MAPK, TGF-β, TP53 and PI3K pathways. Although these pathways influence intestinal stem cell niche signaling, the extent to which mutations in these pathways contribute to human colorectal carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system to introduce multiple such mutations into organoids derived from normal human intestinal epithelium. By modulating the culture conditions to mimic that of the intestinal niche, we selected isogenic organoids harboring mutations in the tumor suppressor genes APC, SMAD4 and TP53, and in the oncogenes KRAS and/or PIK3CA. Organoids engineered to express all five mutations grew independently of niche factors in vitro, and they formed tumors after implantation under the kidney subcapsule in mice. Although they formed micrometastases containing dormant tumor-initiating cells after injection into the spleen of mice, they failed to colonize in the liver. In contrast, engineered organoids derived from chromosome-instable human adenomas formed macrometastatic colonies. These results suggest that 'driver' pathway mutations enable stem cell maintenance in the hostile tumor microenvironment, but that additional molecular lesions are required for invasive behavior.

25686104,2015,Nature medicine,Synthetic lethality by targeting EZH2 methyltransferase activity in ARID1A-mutated cancers.,"The gene encoding ARID1A, a chromatin remodeler, shows one of the highest mutation rates across many cancer types. Notably, ARID1A is mutated in over 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which currently have no effective therapy. To date, clinically applicable targeted cancer therapy based on ARID1A mutational status has not been described. Here we show that inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells and that ARID1A mutational status correlated with response to the EZH2 inhibitor. We identified PIK3IP1 as a direct target of ARID1A and EZH2 that is upregulated by EZH2 inhibition and contributed to the observed synthetic lethality by inhibiting PI3K-AKT signaling. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition caused regression of ARID1A-mutated ovarian tumors in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first data set to demonstrate a synthetic lethality between ARID1A mutation and EZH2 inhibition. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 represents a novel treatment strategy for cancers involving ARID1A mutations.

25665180,2015,Nature medicine,A C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor restores glucocorticoid sensitivity and relieves a mouse allograft model of Cushing disease.,"One function of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticotroph cells is to suppress the transcription of the gene encoding proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Cushing disease is a neuroendocrine condition caused by partially glucocorticoid-resistant corticotroph adenomas that excessively secrete ACTH, which leads to hypercortisolism. Mutations that impair GR function explain glucocorticoid resistance only in sporadic cases. However, the proper folding of GR depends on direct interactions with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90, refs. 7,8). We show here that corticotroph adenomas overexpress HSP90 compared to the normal pituitary. N- and C-terminal HSP90 inhibitors act at different steps of the HSP90 catalytic cycle to regulate corticotroph cell proliferation and GR transcriptional activity. C-terminal inhibitors cause the release of mature GR from HSP90, which promotes its exit from the chaperone cycle and potentiates its transcriptional activity in a corticotroph cell line and in primary cultures of human corticotroph adenomas. In an allograft mouse model, the C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor silibinin showed anti-tumorigenic effects, partially reverted hormonal alterations, and alleviated symptoms of Cushing disease. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of Cushing disease caused by overexpression of heat shock proteins and consequently misregulated GR sensitivity may be overcome pharmacologically with an appropriate HSP90 inhibitor.

Here we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are synthetic lethal to the IDH1(R132H) mutation in AML and identified the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. IDH1- and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models. This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HG-mediated inhibition of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2 mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies.

25485910,2015,Nature medicine,Mutations in G protein β subunits promote transformation and kinase inhibitor resistance.,"Activating mutations in genes encoding G protein α (Gα) subunits occur in 4-5% of all human cancers, but oncogenic alterations in Gβ subunits have not been defined. Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the Gβ proteins GNB1 and GNB2 confer cytokine-independent growth and activate canonical G protein signaling. Multiple mutations in GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds Gα subunits as well as downstream effectors and disrupt Gα interactions with the Gβγ dimer. Different mutations in Gβ proteins clustered partly on the basis of lineage; for example, all 11 GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid neoplasms, and seven of eight GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms. Expression of patient-derived GNB1 variants in Cdkn2a-deficient mouse bone marrow followed by transplantation resulted in either myeloid or B cell malignancies. In vivo treatment with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced signaling and markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, mutations in the gene encoding GNB1 co-occurred with oncogenic kinase alterations, including the BCR-ABL fusion protein, the V617F substitution in JAK2 and the V600K substitution in BRAF. Coexpression of patient-derived GNB1 variants with these mutant kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context. Thus, GNB1 and GNB2 alterations confer transformed and resistance phenotypes across a range of human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of G protein signaling.

25419709,2014,Nature medicine,Disruption of the PRKCD-FBXO25-HAX-1 axis attenuates the apoptotic response and drives lymphomagenesis.,"We searched for genetic alterations in human B cell lymphoma that affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This approach identified FBXO25 within a minimal common region of frequent deletion in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FBXO25 encodes an orphan F-box protein that determines the substrate specificity of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)(FBXO25) ubiquitin ligase complex. An unbiased screen uncovered the prosurvival protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) as the bona fide substrate of FBXO25 that is targeted after apoptotic stresses. Protein kinase Cδ (PRKCD) initiates this process by phosphorylating FBXO25 and HAX-1, thereby spatially directing nuclear FBXO25 to mitochondrial HAX-1. Our analyses in primary human MCL identify monoallelic loss of FBXO25 and stabilizing HAX1 phosphodegron mutations. Accordingly, FBXO25 re-expression in FBXO25-deleted MCL cells promotes cell death, whereas expression of the HAX-1 phosphodegron mutant inhibits apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FBXO25 significantly accelerated lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc mice and in a human MCL xenotransplant model. Together we identify a PRKCD-dependent proapoptotic mechanism controlling HAX-1 stability, and we propose that FBXO25 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and that HAX1 is a proto-oncogene in MCL.

Here we use HMPS tissue and a mouse model of the disease to show that epithelial GREM1 disrupts homeostatic intestinal morphogen gradients, altering cell fate that is normally determined by position along the vertical epithelial axis. This promotes the persistence and/or reacquisition of stem cell properties in Lgr5-negative progenitor cells that have exited the stem cell niche. These cells form ectopic crypts, proliferate, accumulate somatic mutations and can initiate intestinal neoplasia, indicating that the crypt base stem cell is not the sole cell of origin of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we show that epithelial expression of GREM1 also occurs in traditional serrated adenomas, sporadic premalignant lesions with a hitherto unknown pathogenesis, and these lesions can be considered the sporadic equivalents of HMPS polyps.

Here we demonstrate that anthracyclines stimulate the rapid production of type I interferons (IFNs) by malignant cells after activation of the endosomal pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). By binding to IFN-α and IFN-β receptors (IFNARs) on neoplastic cells, type I IFNs trigger autocrine and paracrine circuitries that result in the release of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10). Tumors lacking Tlr3 or Ifnar failed to respond to chemotherapy unless type I IFN or Cxcl10, respectively, was artificially supplied. Moreover, a type I IFN-related signature predicted clinical responses to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in several independent cohorts of patients with breast carcinoma characterized by poor prognosis. Our data suggest that anthracycline-mediated immune responses mimic those induced by viral pathogens. We surmise that such 'viral mimicry' constitutes a hallmark of successful chemotherapy.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a unique resource for comprehensive discovery of mutations and genes in blood that may contribute to the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we analyzed blood-derived sequence data from 2,728 individuals from TCGA and discovered 77 blood-specific mutations in cancer-associated genes, the majority being associated with advanced age. Remarkably, 83% of these mutations were from 19 leukemia and/or lymphoma-associated genes, and nine were recurrently mutated (DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2, ASXL1, TP53, GNAS, PPM1D, BCORL1 and SF3B1). We identified 14 additional mutations in a very small fraction of blood cells, possibly representing the earliest stages of clonal expansion in hematopoietic stem cells. Comparison of these findings to mutations in hematological malignancies identified several recurrently mutated genes that may be disease initiators.

25326799,2014,Nature medicine,A next-generation dual-recombinase system for time- and host-specific targeting of pancreatic cancer.,"Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have dramatically improved our understanding of tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance. However, sequential genetic manipulation of gene expression and targeting of the host is almost impossible using conventional Cre-loxP-based models. We have developed an inducible dual-recombinase system by combining flippase-FRT (Flp-FRT) and Cre-loxP recombination technologies to improve GEMMs of pancreatic cancer. This enables investigation of multistep carcinogenesis, genetic manipulation of tumor subpopulations (such as cancer stem cells), selective targeting of the tumor microenvironment and genetic validation of therapeutic targets in autochthonous tumors on a genome-wide scale. As a proof of concept, we performed tumor cell-autonomous and nonautonomous targeting, recapitulated hallmarks of human multistep carcinogenesis, validated genetic therapy by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase inactivation as well as cancer cell depletion and show that mast cells in the tumor microenvironment, which had been thought to be key oncogenic players, are dispensable for tumor formation.

25261994,2014,Nature medicine,Elevation of circulating branched-chain amino acids is an early event in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma development.,"Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are diagnosed with advanced disease and survive less than 12 months. PDAC has been linked with obesity and glucose intolerance, but whether changes in circulating metabolites are associated with early cancer progression is unknown. To better understand metabolic derangements associated with early disease, we profiled metabolites in prediagnostic plasma from individuals with pancreatic cancer (cases) and matched controls from four prospective cohort studies. We find that elevated plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of future pancreatic cancer diagnosis. This elevated risk was independent of known predisposing factors, with the strongest association observed among subjects with samples collected 2 to 5 years before diagnosis, when occult disease is probably present. We show that plasma BCAAs are also elevated in mice with early-stage pancreatic cancers driven by mutant Kras expression but not in mice with Kras-driven tumors in other tissues, and that breakdown of tissue protein accounts for the increase in plasma BCAAs that accompanies early-stage disease. Together, these findings suggest that increased whole-body protein breakdown is an early event in development of PDAC.","Mayers, Jared R;Wu, Chen;Clish, Clary B;Kraft, Peter;Torrence, Margaret E;Fiske, Brian P;Yuan, Chen;Bao, Ying;Townsend, Mary K;Tworoger, Shelley S;Davidson, Shawn M;Papagiannakopoulos, Thales;Yang, Annan;Dayton, Talya L;Ogino, Shuji;Stampfer, Meir J;Giovannucci, Edward L;Qian, Zhi Rong;Rubinson, Douglas A;Ma, Jing;Sesso, Howard D;Gaziano, John Michael;Cochrane, Barbara B;Liu, Simin;Wactawski-Wende, Jean;Manson, JoAnn E;Pollak, Michael N;Kimmelman, Alec C;Souza, Amanda;Pierce, Kerry;Wang, Thomas J;Gerszten, Robert E;Fuchs, Charles S;Vander Heiden, Matthew G;Wolpin, Brian M"
25216638,2014,Nature medicine,In vivo RNAi screening identifies a mechanism of sorafenib resistance in liver cancer.,"In solid tumors, resistance to therapy inevitably develops upon treatment with cytotoxic drugs or molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we describe a system that enables pooled shRNA screening directly in mouse hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in vivo to identify genes likely to be involved in therapy resistance. Using a focused shRNA library targeting genes located within focal genomic amplifications of human HCC, we screened for genes whose inhibition increased the therapeutic efficacy of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Both shRNA-mediated and pharmacological silencing of Mapk14 (p38α) were found to sensitize mouse HCC to sorafenib therapy and prolong survival by abrogating Mapk14-dependent activation of Mek-Erk and Atf2 signaling. Elevated Mapk14-Atf2 signaling predicted poor response to sorafenib therapy in human HCC, and sorafenib resistance of p-Mapk14-expressing HCC cells could be reverted by silencing Mapk14. Our results suggest that a combination of sorafenib and Mapk14 blockade is a promising approach to overcoming therapy resistance of human HCC.

Here we identify a new long range-acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.

25194568,2014,Nature medicine,A new tumor suppressor role for the Notch pathway in bladder cancer.,"The Notch signaling pathway controls cell fates through interactions between neighboring cells by positively or negatively affecting the processes of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a context-dependent manner. This pathway has been implicated in human cancer as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. Here we report new inactivating mutations in Notch pathway components in over 40% of human bladder cancers examined. Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the male population of the United States. Thus far, driver mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and, less commonly, in RAS proteins have been identified. We show that Notch activation in bladder cancer cells suppresses proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by directly upregulating dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), thus reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2). In mouse models, genetic inactivation of Notch signaling leads to Erk1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in tumorigenesis in the urinary tract. Collectively our findings show that loss of Notch activity is a driving event in urothelial cancer.

25173427,2014,Nature medicine,Rationale for co-targeting IGF-1R and ALK in ALK fusion-positive lung cancer.,"Crizotinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), shows marked activity in patients whose lung cancers harbor fusions in the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), but its efficacy is limited by variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer who had an exceptional response to an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)-specific antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy. Collectively these data support a role for the IGF-1R-IRS-1 pathway in both ALK TKI-sensitive and ALK TKI-resistant states and provide a biological rationale for further clinical development of dual ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors.

25150496,2014,Nature medicine,The G protein α subunit Gαs is a tumor suppressor in Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, exhibits distinct molecular subtypes and cellular origins. Genetic alterations driving medulloblastoma initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we identify GNAS, encoding the G protein Gαs, as a potent tumor suppressor gene that, when expressed at low levels, defines a subset of aggressive Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven human medulloblastomas. Ablation of the single Gnas gene in anatomically distinct progenitors in mice is sufficient to induce Shh-associated medulloblastomas, which recapitulate their human counterparts. Gαs is highly enriched at the primary cilium of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling by regulating both the cAMP-dependent pathway and ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog pathway components. Elevation in levels of a Gαs effector, cAMP, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in Gnas-ablated mice. Thus, our gain- and loss-of-function studies identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function for Gαs that can be found consistently across Shh-group medulloblastomas of disparate cellular and anatomical origins, highlighting G protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue.

Here we integrate proteomic and imaging analyses of caveolae at the blood-tumor interface to discover an active transendothelial portal to infiltrate tumors. A post-translationally modified form of annexin A1 (AnnA1) is selectively concentrated in human and rodent tumor caveolae. To follow trafficking, we generated a specific AnnA1 antibody that targets caveolae in the tumor endothelium. Intravital microscopy of caveolae-immunotargeted fluorophores even at low intravenous doses showed rapid and robust pumping across the endothelium to enter mammary, prostate and lung tumors. Within 1 h, the fluorescence signal concentrated throughout tumors to exceed the peak levels in blood. This transvascular pumping required the expression of caveolin 1 and annexin A1. Tumor uptake with other antibodies were >100-fold less. This proteomic imaging strategy reveals a unique target, antibody and caveolae pumping system for solid tumor penetration.

NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be prevented pharmacologically.

Genomic analysis of isolated CTCs revealed considerable similarity to the corresponding CDX. Most marked differences were observed between CDXs from patients with different clinical outcomes. These data demonstrate that CTC molecular analysis via serial blood sampling could facilitate delivery of personalized medicine for SCLC.

Cancer aggressiveness promotes the clustering of drug nanocarriers and gold nanoparticles in cancer cells.

In multiple tumor models, intravenous peptibody injection completely depleted blood, splenic and intratumoral MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice without affecting proinflammatory immune cell types, such as dendritic cells. Whereas control Gr-1-specific antibody primarily depleted granulocytic MDSCs, peptibodies depleted both granulocytic and monocytic MDSC subsets. Peptibody treatment was associated with inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, which was superior to that achieved with Gr-1-specific antibody.

Here we used a single air-liquid interface culture method without modification to engineer oncogenic mutations into primary epithelial and mesenchymal organoids from mouse colon, stomach and pancreas. Pancreatic and gastric organoids exhibited dysplasia as a result of expression of Kras carrying the G12D mutation (Kras(G12D)), p53 loss or both and readily generated adenocarcinoma after in vivo transplantation. In contrast, primary colon organoids required combinatorial Apc, p53, Kras(G12D) and Smad4 mutations for progressive transformation to invasive adenocarcinoma-like histology in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, recapitulating multi-hit models of colorectal cancer (CRC), as compared to the more promiscuous transformation of small intestinal organoids.

In hematological cancers, the relevance of ongoing DNA damage and the mechanisms by which apoptosis is suppressed are largely unknown. We found pervasive DNA damage in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, which leads to activation of a p53-independent, proapoptotic network centered on nuclear relocalization of ABL1 kinase. Although nuclear ABL1 triggers cell death through its interaction with the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 in normal cells, we show that low YAP1 levels prevent nuclear ABL1-induced apoptosis in these hematologic malignancies. YAP1 is under the control of a serine-threonine kinase, STK4. Notably, genetic inactivation of STK4 restores YAP1 levels, triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo.

24793239,2014,Nature medicine,Tumor endothelium FasL establishes a selective immune barrier promoting tolerance in tumors.,"We describe a new mechanism regulating the tumor endothelial barrier and T cell infiltration into tumors. We detected selective expression of the death mediator Fas ligand (FasL, also called CD95L) in the vasculature of human and mouse solid tumors but not in normal vasculature. In these tumors, FasL expression was associated with scarce CD8(+) infiltration and a predominance of FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells. Tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) cooperatively induced FasL expression in endothelial cells, which acquired the ability to kill effector CD8(+) T cells but not Treg cells because of higher levels of c-FLIP expression in Treg cells. In mice, genetic or pharmacologic suppression of FasL produced a substantial increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF and PGE2 produced a marked increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells that was dependent on attenuation of FasL expression and led to CD8-dependent tumor growth suppression. Thus, tumor paracrine mechanisms establish a tumor endothelial death barrier, which has a critical role in establishing immune tolerance and determining the fate of tumors.

24562383,2014,Nature medicine,ARID1B is a specific vulnerability in ARID1A-mutant cancers.,"Recent studies have revealed that ARID1A, encoding AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI-like), is frequently mutated across a variety of human cancers and also has bona fide tumor suppressor properties. Consequently, identification of vulnerabilities conferred by ARID1A mutation would have major relevance for human cancer. Here, using a broad screening approach, we identify ARID1B, an ARID1A homolog whose gene product is mutually exclusive with ARID1A in SWI/SNF complexes, as the number 1 gene preferentially required for the survival of ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines. We show that loss of ARID1B in ARID1A-deficient backgrounds destabilizes SWI/SNF and impairs proliferation in both cancer cells and primary cells. We also find that ARID1A and ARID1B are frequently co-mutated in cancer but that ARID1A-deficient cancers retain at least one functional ARID1B allele.

24487434,2014,Nature medicine,Fas ligand-mediated immune surveillance by T cells is essential for the control of spontaneous B cell lymphomas.,"Loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP1) or deregulated expression of the oncogene BCL6 occurs in a large proportion of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases. However, targeted mutation of either gene in mice leads to only slow and infrequent development of malignant lymphoma, and despite frequent mutation of BCL6 in activated B cells of healthy individuals, lymphoma development is rare. Here we show that T cells prevent the development of overt lymphoma in mice caused by Blimp1 deficiency or overexpression of Bcl6 in the B cell lineage. Impairment of T cell control results in rapid development of DLBCL-like disease, which can be eradicated by polyclonal CD8(+) T cells in a T cell receptor-, CD28- and Fas ligand-dependent manner. Thus, malignant transformation of mature B cells requires mutations that impair intrinsic differentiation processes and permit escape from T cell-mediated tumor surveillance.

24412926,2014,Nature medicine,Activation of a promyelocytic leukemia-tumor protein 53 axis underlies acute promyelocytic leukemia cure.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is driven by the promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor-α (PML-RARA) fusion protein, which interferes with nuclear receptor signaling and PML nuclear body (NB) assembly. APL is the only malignancy definitively cured by targeted therapies: retinoic acid (RA) and/or arsenic trioxide, which both trigger PML-RARA degradation through nonoverlapping pathways. Yet, the cellular and molecular determinants of treatment efficacy remain disputed. We demonstrate that a functional Pml-transformation-related protein 53 (Trp53) axis is required to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in a mouse model of APL. Upon RA-induced PML-RARA degradation, normal Pml elicits NB reformation and induces a Trp53 response exhibiting features of senescence but not apoptosis, ultimately abrogating APL-initiating activity. Apart from triggering PML-RARA degradation, arsenic trioxide also targets normal PML to enhance NB reformation, which may explain its clinical potency, alone or with RA. This Pml-Trp53 checkpoint initiated by therapy-triggered NB restoration is specific for PML-RARA-driven APL, but not the RA-resistant promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARA variant. Yet, as NB biogenesis is druggable, it could be therapeutically exploited in non-APL malignancies. ","Ablain, Julien;Rice, Kim;Soilihi, Hassane;de Reynies, Aurélien;Minucci, Saverio;de Thé, Hugues"
24362935,2014,Nature medicine,Pharmacological and genomic profiling identifies NF-κB-targeted treatment strategies for mantle cell lymphoma.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive malignancy that is characterized by poor prognosis. Large-scale pharmacological profiling across more than 100 hematological cell line models identified a subset of MCL cell lines that are highly sensitive to the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors ibrutinib and sotrastaurin. Sensitive MCL models exhibited chronic activation of the BCR-driven classical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, whereas insensitive cell lines displayed activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway. Transcriptome sequencing revealed genetic lesions in alternative NF-κB pathway signaling components in ibrutinib-insensitive cell lines, and sequencing of 165 samples from patients with MCL identified recurrent mutations in TRAF2 or BIRC3 in 15% of these individuals. Although they are associated with insensitivity to ibrutinib, lesions in the alternative NF-κB pathway conferred dependence on the protein kinase NIK (also called mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 14 or MAP3K14) both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, NIK is a new therapeutic target for MCL treatment, particularly for lymphomas that are refractory to BCR pathway inhibitors. Our findings reveal a pattern of mutually exclusive activation of the BCR-NF-κB or NIK-NF-κB pathways in MCL and provide critical insights into patient stratification strategies for NF-κB pathway-targeted agents.

Evidence from xenograft models and human trials indicates selective enrichment of cancer-initiating cells (CICs) in tumors that survive therapy. Together with recent reports showing that CIC gene signatures influence patient survival, these studies predict that targeting self-renewal, the key 'stemness' property unique to CICs, may represent a new paradigm in cancer therapy. Here we demonstrate that tumor formation and, more specifically, human colorectal CIC function are dependent on the canonical self-renewal regulator BMI-1. Downregulation of BMI-1 inhibits the ability of colorectal CICs to self-renew, resulting in the abrogation of their tumorigenic potential. Treatment of primary colorectal cancer xenografts with a small-molecule BMI-1 inhibitor resulted in colorectal CIC loss with long-term and irreversible impairment of tumor growth. Targeting the BMI-1-related self-renewal machinery provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Our data show that emergent recurrent tumors acquire a phenotype radically different from that of their originating primary tumors. This phenotype allows them to evade a host-derived innate immune response elicited by the progression from minimal residual disease (MRD) to actively growing recurrence. Screening for this innate response predicted accurately in which mice recurrence would occur. Premature induction of recurrence resensitized MRD to the primary therapy, suggesting a possible paradigm shift for clinical treatment of dormant disease in which the current expectant approach is replaced with active attempts to uncover MRD before evolution of the escape phenotype is complete. By combining screening with second-line treatments targeting innate insensitivity, up to 100% of mice that would have otherwise relapsed were cured. These data may open new avenues for early detection and appropriately timed, highly targeted treatment of tumor recurrence irrespective of tumor type or frontline treatment.

This plasticity is enabled by underlying shifts in epigenetic regulation. A small cohort of pleiotropically acting transcription factors is widely recognized to effect these shifts by controlling the expression of a constituency of key target genes. These master regulators depend on complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, notably the induction of changes in the modifications of chromatin-associated histones, in order to achieve the widespread changes in gene expression observed during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). These associations indicate that an understanding of the functional interactions between such EMT-inducing transcription factors and the modulators of chromatin configuration will provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying cancer progression and may, in the longer term, generate new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for treating high-grade malignancies.

However, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic TME is a challenging undertaking, as the TME has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that re-education of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer.

However, only rarely do tumors regress completely, and the therapeutic effects are often temporary. Several mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors have been proposed. The majority of these cause ERK signaling to become insensitive to treatment with RAF inhibitors by increasing the amount of RAF dimers in cells, whereas others bypass the dependence of the tumor on mutant RAF. One motivation for studying mechanisms of drug resistance is that such efforts may suggest new therapeutic targets or rational combination strategies that delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant clones.

Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is released during bone remodeling and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs, but a role for TGF-β1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell-specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene-induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced AML in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-β1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML.

A combination of PI3K and SHH signaling inhibitors not only suppressed the activation of both pathways but also abrogated S6 kinase (S6K) signaling. Accordingly, targeting both pathways simultaneously resulted in mitotic catastrophe and tumor apoptosis and markedly reduced the growth of PTEN-deficient glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo.

CSF-1R blockade additionally slowed intracranial growth of patient-derived glioma xenografts. Surprisingly, TAMs were not depleted in treated mice. Instead, glioma-secreted factors, including granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), facilitated TAM survival in the context of CSF-1R inhibition. Expression of alternatively activated M2 markers decreased in surviving TAMs, which is consistent with impaired tumor-promoting functions.

Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells are therefore considered promising targets to enhance antitumor immunity, and approaches for their therapeutic modulation are being developed. However, although studies showing that experimentally depleting Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells can enhance antitumor responses provide proof of principle, these studies lack clear translational potential and have various shortcomings.

While ample evidence indicates that such resistance can be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we have uncovered a paracrine signaling network between the adaptive and innate immune systems that is associated with resistance in multiple tumor models: lymphoma, lung and colon. Tumor-infiltrating T helper type 17 (T(H)17) cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) induced the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and extracellular-related kinase (ERK) signaling, leading to immature myeloid-cell mobilization and recruitment into the tumor microenvironment.

Tumors resistant to treatment with antibodies to VEGF were rendered sensitive in IL-17 receptor (IL-17R)-knockout hosts deficient in T(H)17 effector function. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of T(H)17 cell function sensitized resistant tumors to therapy with antibodies to VEGF.

When combined with homozygous Pten loss, the mice developed accelerated, highly penetrant invasive prostate cancer. In mouse prostate tissue, ERG markedly increased androgen receptor (AR) binding. Robust ERG-mediated transcriptional changes, observed only in the setting of Pten loss, included the restoration of AR transcriptional output and upregulation of genes involved in cell death, migration, inflammation and angiogenesis. Similarly, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) positively regulated the AR cistrome and transcriptional output in ETV1-translocated, PTEN-deficient human prostate cancer cells. In two large clinical cohorts, expression of ERG and ETV1 correlated with higher AR transcriptional output in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer specimens.

23793099,2013,Nature medicine,BCAT1 promotes cell proliferation through amino acid catabolism in gliomas carrying wild-type IDH1.,"Here we show that glioblastoma express high levels of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), the enzyme that initiates the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Expression of BCAT1 was exclusive to tumors carrying wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes and was highly correlated with methylation patterns in the BCAT1 promoter region. BCAT1 expression was dependent on the concentration of α-ketoglutarate substrate in glioma cell lines and could be suppressed by ectopic overexpression of mutant IDH1 in immortalized human astrocytes, providing a link between IDH1 function and BCAT1 expression. Suppression of BCAT1 in glioma cell lines blocked the excretion of glutamate and led to reduced proliferation and invasiveness in vitro, as well as significant decreases in tumor growth in a glioblastoma xenograft model. These findings suggest a central role for BCAT1 in glioma pathogenesis, making BCAT1 and BCAA metabolism attractive targets for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to treat patients with glioblastoma.

23644516,2013,Nature medicine,Mining exomic sequencing data to identify mutated antigens recognized by adoptively transferred tumor-reactive T cells.,"Substantial regressions of metastatic lesions have been observed in up to 70% of patients with melanoma who received adoptively transferred autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in phase 2 clinical trials. In addition, 40% of patients treated in a recent trial experienced complete regressions of all measurable lesions for at least 5 years following TIL treatment. To evaluate the potential association between the ability of TILs to mediate durable regressions and their ability to recognize potent antigens that presumably include mutated gene products, we developed a new screening approach involving mining whole-exome sequence data to identify mutated proteins expressed in patient tumors. We then synthesized and evaluated candidate mutated T cell epitopes that were identified using a major histocompatibility complex-binding algorithm for recognition by TILs. Using this approach, we identified mutated antigens expressed on autologous tumor cells that were recognized by three bulk TIL lines from three individuals with melanoma that were associated with objective tumor regressions following adoptive transfer. This simplified approach for identifying mutated antigens recognized by T cells avoids the need to generate and laboriously screen cDNA libraries from tumors and may represent a generally applicable method for identifying mutated antigens expressed in a variety of tumor types.","Robbins, Paul F;Lu, Yong-Chen;El-Gamil, Mona;Li, Yong F;Gross, Colin;Gartner, Jared;Lin, Jimmy C;Teer, Jamie K;Cliften, Paul;Tycksen, Eric;Samuels, Yardena;Rosenberg, Steven A"
23603816,2013,Nature medicine,IQGAP1 scaffold-kinase interaction blockade selectively targets RAS-MAP kinase-driven tumors.,"Upregulation of the ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade occurs in >30% of cancers, often through mutational activation of receptor tyrosine kinases or other upstream genes, including KRAS and BRAF. Efforts to target endogenous MAPKs are challenged by the fact that these kinases are required for viability in mammals. Additionally, the effectiveness of new inhibitors of mutant BRAF has been diminished by acquired tumor resistance through selection for BRAF-independent mechanisms of ERK1/2 induction. Furthermore, recently identified ERK1/2-inducing mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2) MAPK genes in melanoma confer resistance to emerging therapeutic MEK inhibitors, underscoring the challenges facing direct kinase inhibition in cancer. MAPK scaffolds, such as IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), assemble pathway kinases to affect signal transmission, and disrupting scaffold function therefore offers an orthogonal approach to MAPK cascade inhibition. Consistent with this, we found a requirement for IQGAP1 in RAS-driven tumorigenesis in mouse and human tissue. In addition, the ERK1/2-binding IQGAP1 WW domain peptide disrupted IQGAP1-ERK1/2 interactions, inhibited RAS- and RAF-driven tumorigenesis, bypassed acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032) and acted as a systemically deliverable therapeutic to significantly increase the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. Scaffold-kinase interaction blockade acts by a mechanism distinct from direct kinase inhibition and may be a strategy to target overactive oncogenic kinase cascades in cancer.","Jameson, Katherine L;Mazur, Pawel K;Zehnder, Ashley M;Zhang, Jiajing;Zarnegar, Brian;Sage, Julien;Khavari, Paul A"
23584090,2013,Nature medicine,Poor-prognosis colon cancer is defined by a molecularly distinct subtype and develops from serrated precursor lesions.,"Colon cancer is a clinically diverse disease. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine which patients will benefit most from adjuvant therapy and impedes the development of new targeted agents. More insight into the biological diversity of colon cancers, especially in relation to clinical features, is therefore needed. We demonstrate, using an unsupervised classification strategy involving over 1,100 individuals with colon cancer, that three main molecularly distinct subtypes can be recognized. Two subtypes have been previously identified and are well characterized (chromosomal-instable and microsatellite-instable cancers). The third subtype is largely microsatellite stable and contains relatively more CpG island methylator phenotype-positive carcinomas but cannot be identified on the basis of characteristic mutations. We provide evidence that this subtype relates to sessile-serrated adenomas, which show highly similar gene expression profiles, including upregulation of genes involved in matrix remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The identification of this subtype is crucial, as it has a very unfavorable prognosis and, moreover, is refractory to epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy.","De Sousa E Melo, Felipe;Wang, Xin;Jansen, Marnix;Fessler, Evelyn;Trinh, Anne;de Rooij, Laura P M H;de Jong, Joan H;de Boer, Onno J;van Leersum, Ronald;Bijlsma, Maarten F;Rodermond, Hans;van der Heijden, Maartje;van Noesel, Carel J M;Tuynman, Jurriaan B;Dekker, Evelien;Markowetz, Florian;Medema, Jan Paul;Vermeulen, Louis"
23584089,2013,Nature medicine,A colorectal cancer classification system that associates cellular phenotype and responses to therapy.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality. Whereas some patients respond well to therapy, others do not, and thus more precise, individualized treatment strategies are needed. To that end, we analyzed gene expression profiles from 1,290 CRC tumors using consensus-based unsupervised clustering. The resultant clusters were then associated with therapeutic response data to the epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted drug cetuximab in 80 patients. The results of these studies define six clinically relevant CRC subtypes. Each subtype shares similarities to distinct cell types within the normal colon crypt and shows differing degrees of 'stemness' and Wnt signaling. Subtype-specific gene signatures are proposed to identify these subtypes. Three subtypes have markedly better disease-free survival (DFS) after surgical resection, suggesting these patients might be spared from the adverse effects of chemotherapy when they have localized disease. One of these three subtypes, identified by filamin A expression, does not respond to cetuximab but may respond to cMET receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Two other subtypes, with poor and intermediate DFS, associate with improved response to the chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI in adjuvant or metastatic settings. Development of clinically deployable assays for these subtypes and of subtype-specific therapies may contribute to more effective management of this challenging disease.","Sadanandam, Anguraj;Lyssiotis, Costas A;Homicsko, Krisztian;Collisson, Eric A;Gibb, William J;Wullschleger, Stephan;Ostos, Liliane C Gonzalez;Lannon, William A;Grotzinger, Carsten;Del Rio, Maguy;Lhermitte, Benoit;Olshen, Adam B;Wiedenmann, Bertram;Cantley, Lewis C;Gray, Joe W;Hanahan, Douglas"

We investigated the contribution of macrophages to physiological and pathological conditions of enhanced erythropoiesis. We used mouse models of induced anemia, polycythemia vera and β-thalassemia in which macrophages were chemically depleted. Our data indicate that macrophages contribute decisively to recovery from induced anemia, as well as the pathological progression of polycythemia vera and β-thalassemia, by modulating erythroid proliferation and differentiation. We validated these observations in primary human cultures, showing a direct impact of macrophages on the proliferation and enucleation of erythroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with polycythemia vera or β-thalassemia.

Peptide/IFA vaccination primed tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells, which accumulated not in tumors but rather at the persisting, antigen-rich vaccination site. Once there, primed T cells became dysfunctional and underwent antigen-driven, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)- and Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis, resulting in hyporesponsiveness to subsequent vaccination. Provision of CD40-specific antibody, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist and interleukin-2 (IL-2) reduced T cell apoptosis but did not prevent vaccination-site sequestration. A nonpersisting vaccine formulation shifted T cell localization toward tumors, inducing superior antitumor activity while reducing systemic T cell dysfunction and promoting memory formation. These data show that persisting vaccine depots can induce specific T cell sequestration, dysfunction and deletion at vaccination sites; short-lived formulations may overcome these limitations and result in greater therapeutic efficacy of peptide-based cancer vaccines.","Hailemichael, Yared;Dai, Zhimin;Jaffarzad, Nina;Ye, Yang;Medina, Miguel A;Huang, Xue-Fei;Dorta-Estremera, Stephanie M;Greeley, Nathaniel R;Nitti, Giovanni;Peng, Weiyi;Liu, Chengwen;Lou, Yanyan;Wang, Zhiqiang;Ma, Wencai;Rabinovich, Brian;Sowell, Ryan T;Schluns, Kimberly S;Davis, Richard E;Hwu, Patrick;Overwijk, Willem W"

JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) is an oncolytic and immunotherapeutic vaccinia virus. To determine the optimal JX-594 dose in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we conducted a randomized phase 2 dose-finding trial (n=30). Radiologists infused low- or high-dose JX-594 into liver tumors (days 1, 15 and 29); infusions resulted in acute detectable intravascular JX-594 genomes. Objective intrahepatic Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) (15%) and Choi (62%) response rates and intrahepatic disease control (50%) were equivalent in injected and distant noninjected tumors at both doses. JX-594 replication and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression preceded the induction of anticancer immunity. In contrast to tumor response rate and immune endpoints, subject survival duration was significantly related to dose (median survival of 14.1 months compared to 6.7 months on the high and low dose, respectively; hazard ratio 0.39; P=0.020).

23377281,2013,Nature medicine,Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.","Tzoneva, Gannie;Perez-Garcia, Arianne;Carpenter, Zachary;Khiabanian, Hossein;Tosello, Valeria;Allegretta, Maddalena;Paietta, Elisabeth;Racevskis, Janis;Rowe, Jacob M;Tallman, Martin S;Paganin, Maddalena;Basso, Giuseppe;Hof, Jana;Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate;Palomero, Teresa;Rabadan, Raul;Ferrando, Adolfo"

A→I editing of AZIN1 transcripts, specifically regulated by ADAR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), results in a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15) and predicted to cause a conformational change, induced a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and conferred gain-of-function phenotypes that were manifested by augmented tumor-initiating potential and more aggressive behavior. Compared with wild-type AZIN1 protein, the edited form has a stronger affinity to antizyme, and the resultant higher AZIN1 protein stability promotes cell proliferation through the neutralization of antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1).

This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis.

However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-X(L) inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of navitoclax to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and BCL-2-selective inhibitor, ABT-199. This compound inhibits the growth of BCL-2-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of ABT-199 in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h.

23223005,2013,Nature medicine,Epigenetic expansion of VHL-HIF signal output drives multiorgan metastasis in renal cancer.,"Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL, is an archetypical tumor-initiating event in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) that leads to the activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). However, VHL mutation status in ccRCC is not correlated with clinical outcome. Here we show that during ccRCC progression, cancer cells exploit diverse epigenetic alterations to empower a branch of the VHL-HIF pathway for metastasis, and the strength of this activation is associated with poor clinical outcome. By analyzing metastatic subpopulations of VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, we discovered an epigenetically altered VHL-HIF response that is specific to metastatic ccRCC. Focusing on the two most prominent pro-metastatic VHL-HIF target genes, we show that loss of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) activates HIF-driven chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in support of chemotactic cell invasion, whereas loss of DNA methylation enables HIF-driven cytohesin 1 interacting protein (CYTIP) expression to protect cancer cells from death cytokine signals. Thus, metastasis in ccRCC is based on an epigenetically expanded output of the tumor-initiating pathway.","Vanharanta, Sakari;Shu, Weiping;Brenet, Fabienne;Hakimi, A Ari;Heguy, Adriana;Viale, Agnes;Reuter, Victor E;Hsieh, James J-D;Scandura, Joseph M;Massagué, Joan"
23202296,2013,Nature medicine,Chemotherapy-triggered cathepsin B release in myeloid-derived suppressor cells activates the Nlrp3 inflammasome and promotes tumor growth.,"Chemotherapeutic agents are widely used for cancer treatment. In addition to their direct cytotoxic effects, these agents harness the host's immune system, which contributes to their antitumor activity. Here we show that two clinically used chemotherapeutic agents, gemcitabine (Gem) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU), activate the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing-3 protein (Nlrp3)-dependent caspase-1 activation complex (termed the inflammasome) in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leading to production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which curtails anticancer immunity. Chemotherapy-triggered IL-1β secretion relied on lysosomal permeabilization and the release of cathepsin B, which bound to Nlrp3 and drove caspase-1 activation. MDSC-derived IL-1β induced secretion of IL-17 by CD4(+) T cells, which blunted the anticancer efficacy of the chemotherapy. Accordingly, Gem and 5FU exerted higher antitumor effects when tumors were established in Nlrp3(-/-) or Casp1(-/-) mice or wild-type mice treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Altogether, these results identify how activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in MDSCs by 5FU and Gem limits the antitumor efficacy of these chemotherapeutic agents.","Bruchard, Mélanie;Mignot, Grégoire;Derangère, Valentin;Chalmin, Fanny;Chevriaux, Angélique;Végran, Frédérique;Boireau, Wilfrid;Simon, Benoit;Ryffel, Bernhard;Connat, Jean Louis;Kanellopoulos, Jean;Martin, François;Rébé, Cédric;Apetoh, Lionel;Ghiringhelli, François"

We found that within hours of oHSV infection of glioblastomas in mice, activated natural killer (NK) cells are recruited to the site of infection. This response substantially diminished the efficacy of glioblastoma virotherapy. oHSV-activated NK cells coordinated macrophage and microglia activation within tumors. In vitro, human NK cells preferentially lysed oHSV-infected human glioblastoma cell lines. This enhanced killing depended on the NK cell natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30 and NKp46, whose ligands are upregulated in oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells. We found that HSV titers and oHSV efficacy are increased in Ncr1(-/-) mice and a Ncr1(-/-) NK cell adoptive transfer model of glioma, respectively.

We also show that circulating GBM microvesicles can be used to analyze primary tumor mutations and as a predictive metric of treatment-induced changes.

Two mechanisms underlie these rearrangements, both of which can be facilitated by a mitotic chromosome segregation error to produce a micronucleus containing the chromosome to undergo rearrangement. In the first, chromosome shattering (chromothripsis) is produced by mitotic entry before completion of DNA replication within the micronucleus, with a failure to disassemble the micronuclear envelope encapsulating the chromosomal fragments for random reassembly in the subsequent interphase. Alternatively, locally defective DNA replication initiates serial, microhomology-mediated template switching (chromoanasynthesis) that produces local rearrangements with altered gene copy numbers. Complex rearrangements are present in a broad spectrum of tumors and in individuals with congenital or developmental defects, highlighting the impact of chromoanagenesis on human disease.","Holland, Andrew J;Cleveland, Don W"
23086478,2012,Nature medicine,NOTCH1 promotes T cell leukemia-initiating activity by RUNX-mediated regulation of PKC-θ and reactive oxygen species.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of cellular metabolism, damage intracellular macromolecules and, when present in excess, can promote normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and exhaustion. However, mechanisms that regulate the amount of ROS in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and the biological role of ROS in these cells are largely unknown. We show here that the ROS(low) subset of CD44(+) cells in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignancy of immature T cell progenitors, is highly enriched in the most aggressive LICs and that ROS accumulation is restrained by downregulation of protein kinase C θ (PKC-θ). Notably, primary mouse T-ALLs lacking PKC-θ show improved LIC activity, whereas enforced PKC-θ expression in both mouse and human primary T-ALLs compromised LIC activity. We also show that PKC-θ is regulated by a new pathway in which NOTCH1 induces runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), RUNX3 represses RUNX1 and RUNX1 induces PKC-θ. NOTCH1, which is frequently activated by mutation in T-ALL and required for LIC activity in both mouse and human models, thus acts to repress PKC-θ. These results reveal key functional roles for PKC-θ and ROS in T-ALL and suggest that aggressive biological behavior in vivo could be limited by therapeutic strategies that promote PKC-θ expression or activity, or the accumulation of ROS.","Giambra, Vincenzo;Jenkins, Christopher R;Wang, Hongfang;Lam, Sonya H;Shevchuk, Olena O;Nemirovsky, Oksana;Wai, Carol;Gusscott, Sam;Chiang, Mark Y;Aster, Jon C;Humphries, R Keith;Eaves, Connie;Weng, Andrew P"

23001183,2012,Nature medicine,LIFR is a breast cancer metastasis suppressor upstream of the Hippo-YAP pathway and a prognostic marker.,"There is a pressing need to identify prognostic markers of metastatic disease and targets for treatment. Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has significant prognostic power.","Chen, Dahu;Sun, Yutong;Wei, Yongkun;Zhang, Peijing;Rezaeian, Abdol Hossein;Teruya-Feldstein, Julie;Gupta, Sumeet;Liang, Han;Lin, Hui-Kuan;Hung, Mien-Chie;Ma, Li"

22983397,2012,Nature medicine,In vivo photodynamic therapy using upconversion nanoparticles as remote-controlled nanotransducers.,"Conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by the penetration depth of visible light needed for its activation. Here we used mesoporous-silica-coated upconversion fluorescent nanoparticles (UCNs) as a nanotransducer to convert deeply penetrating near-infrared light to visible wavelengths and a carrier of photosensitizers. We also used the multicolor-emission capability of the UCNs at a single excitation wavelength for simultaneous activation of two photosensitizers for enhanced PDT. We showed a greater PDT efficacy with the dual-photosensitizer approach compared to approaches using a single photosensitizer, as determined by enhanced generation of singlet oxygen and reduced cell viability. In vivo studies also showed tumor growth inhibition in PDT-treated mice by direct injection of UCNs into melanoma tumors or intravenous injection of UCNs conjugated with a tumor-targeting agent into tumor-bearing mice. As the first demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, of the photosensitizer-loaded UCN as an in vivo-targeted PDT agent, this finding may serve as a platform for future noninvasive deep-cancer therapy.","Idris, Niagara Muhammad;Gnanasammandhan, Muthu Kumara;Zhang, Jing;Ho, Paul C;Mahendran, Ratha;Zhang, Yong"
22983396,2012,Nature medicine,Oncogenic NRAS signaling differentially regulates survival and proliferation in melanoma.,"The discovery of potent inhibitors of the BRAF proto-oncogene has revolutionized therapy for melanoma harboring mutations in BRAF, yet NRAS-mutant melanoma remains without an effective therapy. Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas.","Kwong, Lawrence N;Costello, James C;Liu, Huiyun;Jiang, Shan;Helms, Timothy L;Langsdorf, Aliete E;Jakubosky, David;Genovese, Giannicola;Muller, Florian L;Jeong, Joseph H;Bender, Ryan P;Chu, Gerald C;Flaherty, Keith T;Wargo, Jennifer A;Collins, James J;Chin, Lynda"
22863786,2012,Nature medicine,Treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment promotes prostate cancer therapy resistance through WNT16B.,"Acquired resistance to anticancer treatments is a substantial barrier to reducing the morbidity and mortality that is attributable to malignant tumors. Components of tissue microenvironments are recognized to profoundly influence cellular phenotypes, including susceptibilities to toxic insults. Using a genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses to genotoxic stress induced by cancer therapeutics, we identified a spectrum of secreted proteins derived from the tumor microenvironment that includes the Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B). We determined that WNT16B expression is regulated by nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-κB) after DNA damage and subsequently signals in a paracrine manner to activate the canonical Wnt program in tumor cells. The expression of WNT16B in the prostate tumor microenvironment attenuated the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, promoting tumor cell survival and disease progression. These results delineate a mechanism by which genotoxic therapies given in a cyclical manner can enhance subsequent treatment resistance through cell nonautonomous effects that are contributed by the tumor microenvironment.","Sun, Yu;Campisi, Judith;Higano, Celestia;Beer, Tomasz M;Porter, Peggy;Coleman, Ilsa;True, Lawrence;Nelson, Peter S"

We treated a total of 96 human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A)*02(+) subjects with advanced RCC with IMA901 in two consecutive studies. In the phase 1 study, the T cell responses of the patients to multiple TUMAPs were associated with better disease control and lower numbers of prevaccine forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. The randomized phase 2 trial showed that a single dose of cyclophosphamide reduced the number of T(reg) cells and confirmed that immune responses to multiple TUMAPs were associated with longer overall survival. Furthermore, among six predefined populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, two were prognostic for overall survival, and among over 300 serum biomarkers, we identified apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) as being predictive for both immune response to IMA901 and overall survival. A randomized phase 3 study to determine the clinical benefit of treatment with IMA901 is ongoing.

Here we show that the juvenile brain has an endogenous defense mechanism against HGAs. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) migrate to HGAs, reduce glioma expansion and prolong survival time by releasing endovanilloids that activate the vanilloid receptor (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member-1 or TRPV1) on HGA cells. TRPV1 is highly expressed in tumor and weakly expressed in tumor-free brain. TRPV1 stimulation triggers tumor cell death through the branch of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway that is controlled by activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3). The antitumorigenic response of NPCs is lost with aging. NPC-mediated tumor suppression can be mimicked in the adult brain by systemic administration of the synthetic vanilloid arvanil, suggesting that TRPV1 agonists have potential as new HGA therapeutics.

22820643,2012,Nature medicine,MDM4 is a key therapeutic target in cutaneous melanoma.,"The inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which often occurs through mutations in TP53 (encoding tumor protein 53) is a common step in human cancer. However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene. Our results identify MDM4 as a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and designate MDM4 as a promising target for antimelanoma combination therapy.

22820642,2012,Nature medicine,Silencing of Irf7 pathways in breast cancer cells promotes bone metastasis through immune escape.,"Breast cancer metastasis is a key determinant of long-term patient survival. By comparing the transcriptomes of primary and metastatic tumor cells in a mouse model of spontaneous bone metastasis, we found that a substantial number of genes suppressed in bone metastases are targets of the interferon regulatory factor Irf7. Restoration of Irf7 in tumor cells or administration of interferon led to reduced bone metastases and prolonged survival time. In mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) receptor or in natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cell responses, metastasis was accelerated, indicating that Irf7-driven suppression of metastasis was reliant on IFN signaling to host immune cells. We confirmed the clinical relevance of these findings in over 800 patients in which high expression of Irf7-regulated genes in primary tumors was associated with prolonged bone metastasis-free survival. This gene signature may identify patients that could benefit from IFN-based therapies. Thus, we have identified an innate immune pathway intrinsic to breast cancer cells, the suppression of which restricts immunosurveillance to enable metastasis.

22772464,2012,Nature medicine,Robust tumor immunity to melanoma mediated by interleukin-9-producing T cells.,"Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a T cell cytokine that acts through a γC-family receptor on target cells and is associated with inflammation and allergy. We determined that T cells from mice deficient in the T helper type 17 (T(H)17) pathway genes encoding retinoid-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) produced abundant IL-9, and we found substantial growth inhibition of B16F10 melanoma in these mice. IL-9-blocking antibodies reversed this tumor growth inhibition and enhanced tumor growth in wild-type (WT) mice. Il9r(-/-) mice showed accelerated tumor growth, and administration of recombinant IL-9 (rIL-9) to tumor-bearing WT and Rag1(-/-) mice inhibited melanoma as well as lung carcinoma growth. Adoptive transfer of tumor-antigen-specific T(H)9 cells into both WT and Rag1(-/-) mice suppressed melanoma growth; this effect was abrogated by treatment with neutralizing antibodies to IL-9. Exogenous rIL-9 inhibited tumor growth in Rag1(-/-) mice but not in mast-cell-deficient mice, suggesting that the targets of IL-9 in this setting include mast cells but not T or B cells. In addition, we found higher numbers of T(H)9 cells in normal human skin and blood compared to metastatic lesions of subjects with progressive stage IV melanoma. These results suggest a role for IL-9 in tumor immunity and offer insight into potential therapeutic strategies.

22683780,2012,Nature medicine,Autocrine activation of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Although the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved substantially in the past three decades, more than half of all patients develop disease that is refractory to intensive chemotherapy. Functional genomics approaches offer a means to discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this receptor. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the design of additional strategies to block adaptive cellular responses that drive compensatory ligand expression as an essential component of the targeted inhibition of oncogenic receptors in human cancers.","Kentsis, Alex;Reed, Casie;Rice, Kim L;Sanda, Takaomi;Rodig, Scott J;Tholouli, Eleni;Christie, Amanda;Valk, Peter J M;Delwel, Ruud;Ngo, Vu;Kutok, Jeffery L;Dahlberg, Suzanne E;Moreau, Lisa A;Byers, Richard J;Christensen, James G;Vande Woude, George;Licht, Jonathan D;Kung, Andrew L;Staudt, Louis M;Look, A Thomas"
22683778,2012,Nature medicine,Profiling of residual breast cancers after neoadjuvant chemotherapy  identifies DUSP4 deficiency as a mechanism of drug resistance.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathological complete response (pCR) in ~30% of patients with breast cancer. However, many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy, which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of tumors after NAC would identify genes associated with drug resistance. Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC. Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), an ERK phosphatase, correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) status. BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes. DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy. Reduced DUSP4 expression in primary tumors after NAC was associated with treatment-refractory high Ki-67 scores and shorter recurrence-free survival. Finally, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) synergized with docetaxel treatment in BLBC xenografts. Thus, DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC, resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy.","Balko, Justin M;Cook, Rebecca S;Vaught, David B;Kuba, María G;Miller, Todd W;Bhola, Neil E;Sanders, Melinda E;Granja-Ingram, Nara M;Smith, J Joshua;Meszoely, Ingrid M;Salter, Janine;Dowsett, Mitch;Stemke-Hale, Katherine;González-Angulo, Ana M;Mills, Gordon B;Pinto, Joseph A;Gómez, Henry L;Arteaga, Carlos L"
22635005,2012,Nature medicine,Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET.,"Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis. We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.","Peinado, Héctor;Alečković, Maša;Lavotshkin, Simon;Matei, Irina;Costa-Silva, Bruno;Moreno-Bueno, Gema;Hergueta-Redondo, Marta;Williams, Caitlin;García-Santos, Guillermo;Ghajar, Cyrus;Nitadori-Hoshino, Ayuko;Hoffman, Caitlin;Badal, Karen;Garcia, Benjamin A;Callahan, Margaret K;Yuan, Jianda;Martins, Vilma R;Skog, Johan;Kaplan, Rosandra N;Brady, Mary S;Wolchok, Jedd D;Chapman, Paul B;Kang, Yibin;Bromberg, Jacqueline;Lyden, David"
22610277,2012,Nature medicine,β-catenin confers resistance to PI3K and AKT inhibitors and subverts FOXO3a to promote metastasis in colon cancer.,"The Wnt–β-catenin and PI3K-AKT-FOXO3a pathways have a central role in cancer. AKT phosporylates FOXO3a, relocating it from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, an effect that is reversed by PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Simultaneous hyperactivation of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway and inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling promote nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and FOXO3a, respectively, promoting cell scattering and metastasis by regulating a defined set of target genes. Indeed, the anti-tumoral AKT inhibitor API-2 promotes nuclear FOXO3a accumulation and metastasis of cells with high nuclear β-catenin content. Nuclear β-catenin confers resistance to the FOXO3a-mediated apoptosis induced by PI3K and AKT inhibitors in patient-derived primary cultures and in corresponding xenograft tumors in mice. This resistance is reversed by XAV-939, an inhibitor of Wnt–β-catenin signaling. In the presence of high nuclear β-catenin content, activation of FOXO3a by PI3K or AKT inhibitors makes it behave as a metastasis inductor rather than a proapoptotic tumor suppressor. We show that it is possible to evaluate the β-catenin status of patients' carcinomas and the response of patient-derived cells to target-directed drugs that accumulate FOXO3a in the nucleus before deciding on a course of treatment. We propose that this evaluation could be essential to the provision of a safer and more effective personalized treatment.","Tenbaum, Stephan P;Ordóñez-Morán, Paloma;Puig, Isabel;Chicote, Irene;Arqués, Oriol;Landolfi, Stefania;Fernández, Yolanda;Herance, José Raúl;Gispert, Juan D;Mendizabal, Leire;Aguilar, Susana;Ramón y Cajal, Santiago;Schwartz, Simó;Vivancos, Ana;Espín, Eloy;Rojas, Santiago;Baselga, José;Tabernero, Josep;Muñoz, Alberto;Palmer, Héctor G"

Four such ImmTACs, each comprising a distinct tumor-associated epitope-specific monoclonal TCR with picomolar affinity fused to a humanized cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3)-specific single-chain antibody fragment (scFv), effectively redirected T cells to kill cancer cells expressing extremely low surface epitope densities.

Current imaging methods are often limited by inadequate sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Here we show that a unique triple-modality magnetic resonance imaging-photoacoustic imaging-Raman imaging nanoparticle (termed here MPR nanoparticle) can accurately help delineate the margins of brain tumors in living mice both preoperatively and intraoperatively. The MPRs were detected by all three modalities with at least a picomolar sensitivity both in vitro and in living mice. Intravenous injection of MPRs into glioblastoma-bearing mice led to MPR accumulation and retention by the tumors, with no MPR accumulation in the surrounding healthy tissue, allowing for a noninvasive tumor delineation using all three modalities through the intact skull. Raman imaging allowed for guidance of intraoperative tumor resection, and a histological correlation validated that Raman imaging was accurately delineating the brain tumor margins.

However, TCR gene transfer results in competition for surface expression and inappropriate pairing between the exogenous and endogenous TCR chains, resulting in suboptimal activity and potentially harmful unpredicted antigen specificities of the resultant TCRs. We designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that promoted the disruption of endogenous TCR β- and α-chain genes. Lymphocytes treated with ZFNs lacked surface expression of CD3-TCR and expanded with the addition of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. After lentiviral transfer of a TCR specific for the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, these TCR-edited cells expressed the new TCR at high levels, were easily expanded to near purity and were superior at specific antigen recognition compared to donor-matched, unedited TCR-transferred cells. In contrast to unedited TCR-transferred cells, the TCR-edited lymphocytes did not mediate off-target reactivity while maintaining their anti-tumor activity in vivo, thus showing that complete editing of T cell specificity generates tumor-specific lymphocytes with improved biosafety profiles.","Provasi, Elena;Genovese, Pietro;Lombardo, Angelo;Magnani, Zulma;Liu, Pei-Qi;Reik, Andreas;Chu, Victoria;Paschon, David E;Zhang, Lei;Kuball, Jurgen;Camisa, Barbara;Bondanza, Attilio;Casorati, Giulia;Ponzoni, Maurilio;Ciceri, Fabio;Bordignon, Claudio;Greenberg, Philip D;Holmes, Michael C;Gregory, Philip D;Naldini, Luigi;Bonini, Chiara"
22426421,2012,Nature medicine,A common BIM deletion polymorphism mediates intrinsic resistance and inferior responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) elicit high response rates among individuals with kinase-driven malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR NSCLC). However, the extent and duration of these responses are heterogeneous, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers affecting an individual's response to TKIs. Using paired-end DNA sequencing, we discovered a common intronic deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM). BIM is a pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins, and its upregulation is required for TKIs to induce apoptosis in kinase-driven cancers. The polymorphism switched BIM splicing from exon 4 to exon 3, which resulted in expression of BIM isoforms lacking the pro-apoptotic BCL2-homology domain 3 (BH3). The polymorphism was sufficient to confer intrinsic TKI resistance in CML and EGFR NSCLC cell lines, but this resistance could be overcome with BH3-mimetic drugs. Notably, individuals with CML and EGFR NSCLC harboring the polymorphism experienced significantly inferior responses to TKIs than did individuals without the polymorphism (P = 0.02 for CML and P = 0.027 for EGFR NSCLC). Our results offer an explanation for the heterogeneity of TKI responses across individuals and suggest the possibility of personalizing therapy with BH3 mimetics to overcome BIM-polymorphism-associated TKI resistance.","Ng, King Pan;Hillmer, Axel M;Chuah, Charles T H;Juan, Wen Chun;Ko, Tun Kiat;Teo, Audrey S M;Ariyaratne, Pramila N;Takahashi, Naoto;Sawada, Kenichi;Fei, Yao;Soh, Sheila;Lee, Wah Heng;Huang, John W J;Allen, John C;Woo, Xing Yi;Nagarajan, Niranjan;Kumar, Vikrant;Thalamuthu, Anbupalam;Poh, Wan Ting;Ang, Ai Leen;Mya, Hae Tha;How, Gee Fung;Yang, Li Yi;Koh, Liang Piu;Chowbay, Balram;Chang, Chia-Tien;Nadarajan, Veera S;Chng, Wee Joo;Than, Hein;Lim, Lay Cheng;Goh, Yeow Tee;Zhang, Shenli;Poh, Dianne;Tan, Patrick;Seet, Ju-Ee;Ang, Mei-Kim;Chau, Noan-Minh;Ng, Quan-Sing;Tan, Daniel S W;Soda, Manabu;Isobe, Kazutoshi;Nöthen, Markus M;Wong, Tien Y;Shahab, Atif;Ruan, Xiaoan;Cacheux-Rataboul, Valère;Sung, Wing-Kin;Tan, Eng Huat;Yatabe, Yasushi;Mano, Hiroyuki;Soo, Ross A;Chin, Tan Min;Lim, Wan-Teck;Ruan, Yijun;Ong, S Tiong"
22406747,2012,Nature medicine,Inhibition of the LSD1 (KDM1A) demethylase reactivates the all-trans-retinoic acid differentiation pathway in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a cytogenetically distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), characterized by the t(15;17)-associated PML-RARA fusion, has been successfully treated with therapy utilizing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to differentiate leukemic blasts. However, among patients with non-APL AML, ATRA-based treatment has not been effective. Here we show that, through epigenetic reprogramming, inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also called KDM1A), including tranylcypromine (TCP), unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. LSD1 inhibition did not lead to a large-scale increase in histone 3 Lys4 dimethylation (H3K4(me2)) across the genome, but it did increase H3K4(me2) and expression of myeloid-differentiation-associated genes. Notably, treatment with ATRA plus TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in vivo in nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting that ATRA in combination with TCP may target leukemia-initiating cells. Furthermore, initiation of ATRA plus TCP treatment 15 d after engraftment of human AML cells in NOD-SCID γ (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor γ chain deficiency) mice also revealed the ATRA plus TCP drug combination to have a potent anti-leukemic effect that was superior to treatment with either drug alone. These data identify LSD1 as a therapeutic target and strongly suggest that it may contribute to AML pathogenesis by inhibiting the normal pro-differentiative function of ATRA, paving the way for new combinatorial therapies for AML.","Schenk, Tino;Chen, Weihsu Claire;Göllner, Stefanie;Howell, Louise;Jin, Liqing;Hebestreit, Katja;Klein, Hans-Ulrich;Popescu, Andreea C;Burnett, Alan;Mills, Ken;Casero, Robert A;Marton, Laurence;Woster, Patrick;Minden, Mark D;Dugas, Martin;Wang, Jean C Y;Dick, John E;Müller-Tidow, Carsten;Petrie, Kevin;Zelent, Arthur"
22388088,2012,Nature medicine,Tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 promotes breast cancer progression and maintains tumor-initiating cells via activation of key transcription factors and a positive feedback signaling loop.,"New cancer therapies are likely to arise from an in-depth understanding of the signaling networks influencing tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. We show a fundamental role for Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) in these processes in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockdown of SHP2 eradicated breast tumor-initiating cells in xenograft models, and SHP2 depletion also prevented invasion in three-dimensional cultures and in a transductal invasion assay in vivo. Notably, SHP2 knockdown in established breast tumors blocked their growth and reduced metastasis. Mechanistically, SHP2 activated stemness-associated transcription factors, including v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which resulted in the repression of let-7 microRNA and the expression of a set of 'SHP2 signature' genes.

22366949,2012,Nature medicine,Reverse engineering of TLX oncogenic transcriptional networks identifies RUNX1 as tumor suppressor in T-ALL.,"The TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factor oncogenes have a key role in the pathogenesis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we used reverse engineering of global transcriptional networks to decipher the oncogenic regulatory circuit controlled by TLX1 and TLX3. This systems biology analysis defined T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1) and TLX3 as master regulators of an oncogenic transcriptional circuit governing T-ALL. Notably, a network structure analysis of this hierarchical network identified RUNX1 as a key mediator of the T-ALL induced by TLX1 and TLX3 and predicted a tumor-suppressor role for RUNX1 in T cell transformation. Consistent with these results, we identified recurrent somatic loss-of-function mutations in RUNX1 in human T-ALL. Overall, these results place TLX1 and TLX3 at the top of an oncogenic transcriptional network controlling leukemia development, show the power of network analyses to identify key elements in the regulatory circuits governing human cancer and identify RUNX1 as a tumor-suppressor gene in T-ALL.","Della Gatta, Giusy;Palomero, Teresa;Perez-Garcia, Arianne;Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto;Bansal, Mukesh;Carpenter, Zachary W;De Keersmaecker, Kim;Sole, Xavier;Xu, Luyao;Paietta, Elisabeth;Racevskis, Janis;Wiernik, Peter H;Rowe, Jacob M;Meijerink, Jules P;Califano, Andrea;Ferrando, Adolfo A"
22344298,2012,Nature medicine,USP15 stabilizes TGF-β receptor I and promotes oncogenesis through the activation of TGF-β signaling in glioblastoma.,"In advanced cancer, including glioblastoma, the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway acts as an oncogenic factor and is considered to be a therapeutic target. Using a functional RNAi screen, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) as a key component of the TGF-β signaling pathway. USP15 binds to the SMAD7-SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2) complex and deubiquitinates and stabilizes type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-I), leading to an enhanced TGF-β signal. High expression of USP15 correlates with high TGF-β activity, and the USP15 gene is found amplified in glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer. USP15 amplification confers poor prognosis in individuals with glioblastoma. Downregulation or inhibition of USP15 in a patient-derived orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma decreases TGF-β activity. Moreover, depletion of USP15 decreases the oncogenic capacity of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells due to the repression of TGF-β signaling. Our results show that USP15 regulates the TGF-β pathway and is a key factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis.","Eichhorn, Pieter J A;Rodón, Laura;Gonzàlez-Juncà, Alba;Dirac, Annette;Gili, Magüi;Martínez-Sáez, Elena;Aura, Claudia;Barba, Ignasi;Peg, Vicente;Prat, Aleix;Cuartas, Isabel;Jimenez, Jose;García-Dorado, David;Sahuquillo, Juan;Bernards, Réné;Baselga, José;Seoane, Joan"

The KIF5B-RET fusion leads to aberrant activation of RET kinase and is considered to be a new driver mutation of LADC because it segregates from mutations or fusions in EGFR, KRAS, HER2 and ALK, and a RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, suppresses the fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth activity of NIH3T3 cells.","Kohno, Takashi;Ichikawa, Hitoshi;Totoki, Yasushi;Yasuda, Kazuki;Hiramoto, Masaki;Nammo, Takao;Sakamoto, Hiromi;Tsuta, Koji;Furuta, Koh;Shimada, Yoko;Iwakawa, Reika;Ogiwara, Hideaki;Oike, Takahiro;Enari, Masato;Schetter, Aaron J;Okayama, Hirokazu;Haugen, Aage;Skaug, Vidar;Chiku, Suenori;Yamanaka, Itaru;Arai, Yasuhito;Watanabe, Shun-Ichi;Sekine, Ikuo;Ogawa, Seishi;Harris, Curtis C;Tsuda, Hitoshi;Yoshida, Teruhiko;Yokota, Jun;Shibata, Tatsuhiro"

Unfortunately, patients eventually develop resistance to these agents. We describe an acquired EGFR ectodomain mutation (S492R) that prevents cetuximab binding and confers resistance to cetuximab. Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab.

22245781,2012,Nature medicine,Molecular imaging using fluorescent lectins permits rapid endoscopic identification of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.,"Barrett's esophagus is an example of a pre-invasive state, for which current endoscopic surveillance methods to detect dysplasia are time consuming and inadequate. The prognosis of cancer arising in Barrett's esophagus is improved by early detection at the stage of mucosal carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. Molecular imaging methods could revolutionize the detection of dysplasia, provided they permit a wide field of view and highlight abnormalities in real time. We show here that cell-surface glycans are altered in the progression from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma and lead to specific changes in lectin binding patterns. We chose wheat germ agglutinin as a candidate lectin with clinical potential.

In this study we report the presence of loss-of-function mutations and deletions of the EZH2 and SUZ12 genes, which encode crucial components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), in 25% of T-ALLs. To further study the role of PRC2 in T-ALL, we used NOTCH1-dependent mouse models of the disease, as well as human T-ALL samples, and combined locus-specific and global analysis of NOTCH1-driven epigenetic changes. These studies demonstrated that activation of NOTCH1 specifically induces loss of the repressive mark Lys27 trimethylation of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by antagonizing the activity of PRC2. These studies suggest a tumor suppressor role for PRC2 in human leukemia and suggest a hitherto unrecognized dynamic interplay between oncogenic NOTCH1 and PRC2 function for the regulation of gene expression and cell transformation.","Ntziachristos, Panagiotis;Tsirigos, Aristotelis;Van Vlierberghe, Pieter;Nedjic, Jelena;Trimarchi, Thomas;Flaherty, Maria Sol;Ferres-Marco, Dolors;da Ros, Vanina;Tang, Zuojian;Siegle, Jasmin;Asp, Patrik;Hadler, Michael;Rigo, Isaura;De Keersmaecker, Kim;Patel, Jay;Huynh, Tien;Utro, Filippo;Poglio, Sandrine;Samon, Jeremy B;Paietta, Elisabeth;Racevskis, Janis;Rowe, Jacob M;Rabadan, Raul;Levine, Ross L;Brown, Stuart;Pflumio, Francoise;Dominguez, Maria;Ferrando, Adolfo;Aifantis, Iannis"
22157681,2011,Nature medicine,EGFR and MET receptor tyrosine kinase-altered microRNA expression induces tumorigenesis and gefitinib resistance in lung cancers.,"The involvement of the MET oncogene in de novo and acquired resistance of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has previously been reported, but the precise mechanism by which MET overexpression contributes to TKI-resistant NSCLC remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression, and their dysregulation has been implicated in tumorigenesis. To understand their role in TKI-resistant NSCLCs, we examined changes in miRNA that are mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors. Here we report that miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-221 and miR-222 are modulated by both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and MET receptors, whereas miR-103 and miR-203 are controlled only by MET. We showed that these miRNAs have important roles in gefitinib-induced apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the expression of the genes encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM), apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF-1), protein kinase C ɛ (PKC-ɛ) and sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (SRC). These findings suggest that modulation of specific miRNAs may provide a therapeutic approach for the treatment of NSCLCs.","Garofalo, Michela;Romano, Giulia;Di Leva, Gianpiero;Nuovo, Gerard;Jeon, Young-Jun;Ngankeu, Apollinaire;Sun, Jin;Lovat, Francesca;Alder, Hansjuerg;Condorelli, Gerolama;Engelman, Jeffrey A;Ono, Mayumi;Rho, Jin Kyung;Cascione, Luciano;Volinia, Stefano;Nephew, Kenneth P;Croce, Carlo M"
22157679,2011,Nature medicine,Reciprocal repression between P53 and TCTP.,"Screening for genes that reprogram cancer cells for the tumor reversion switch identified TCTP (encoding translationally controlled tumor protein) as a crucial regulator of apoptosis. Here we report a negative feedback loop between P53 and TCTP. TCTP promotes P53 degradation by competing with NUMB for binding to P53-MDM2-containing complexes. TCTP inhibits MDM2 auto-ubiquitination and promotes MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of P53. Notably, Tctp haploinsufficient mice are sensitized to P53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, P53 directly represses TCTP transcription. In 508 breast cancers, high-TCTP status associates with poorly differentiated, aggressive G3-grade tumors, predicting poor prognosis (P < 0.0005). Tctp knockdown in primary mammary tumor cells from ErbB2 transgenic mice results in increased P53 expression and a decreased number of stem-like cancer cells. The pharmacological compounds sertraline and thioridazine increase the amount of P53 by neutralizing TCTP's action on the MDM2-P53 axis. This study links TCTP and P53 in a previously unidentified regulatory circuitry that may underlie the relevance of TCTP in cancer.","Amson, Robert;Pece, Salvatore;Lespagnol, Alexandra;Vyas, Rajesh;Mazzarol, Giovanni;Tosoni, Daniela;Colaluca, Ivan;Viale, Giuseppe;Rodrigues-Ferreira, Sylvie;Wynendaele, Jessika;Chaloin, Olivier;Hoebeke, Johan;Marine, Jean-Christophe;Di Fiore, Pier Paolo;Telerman, Adam"
22138752,2011,Nature medicine,Key contribution of CPEB4-mediated translational control to cancer progression.,"Malignant transformation, invasion and angiogenesis rely on the coordinated reprogramming of gene expression in the cells from which the tumor originated. Although deregulated gene expression has been extensively studied at genomic and epigenetic scales, the contribution of the regulation of mRNA-specific translation to this reprogramming is not well understood. Here we show that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4), an RNA binding protein that mediates meiotic mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation, is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and glioblastomas, where it supports tumor growth, vascularization and invasion. We also show that, in pancreatic tumors, the pro-oncogenic functions of CPEB4 originate in the translational activation of mRNAs that are silenced in normal tissue, including the mRNA of tissue plasminogen activator, a key contributor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma malignancy. Taken together, our results document a key role for post-transcriptional gene regulation in tumor development and describe a detailed mechanism for gene expression reprogramming underlying malignant tumor progression.","Ortiz-Zapater, Elena;Pineda, David;Martínez-Bosch, Neus;Fernández-Miranda, Gonzalo;Iglesias, Mar;Alameda, Francesc;Moreno, Mireia;Eliscovich, Carolina;Eyras, Eduardo;Real, Francisco X;Méndez, Raúl;Navarro, Pilar"

Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to explore the landscape of gene fusions in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We observed that individual breast cancers have a variety of expressed gene fusions. We identified two classes of recurrent gene rearrangements involving genes encoding microtubule-associated serine-threonine kinase (MAST) and members of the Notch family. Both MAST and Notch-family gene fusions have substantial phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cell lines harboring Notch gene rearrangements are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of Notch signaling, and overexpression of MAST1 or MAST2 gene fusions has a proliferative effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that recurrent gene rearrangements have key roles in subsets of carcinomas and suggest that transcriptome sequencing could identify individuals with rare, targetable gene fusions.","Robinson, Dan R;Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker;Wu, Yi-Mi;Shankar, Sunita;Cao, Xuhong;Ateeq, Bushra;Asangani, Irfan A;Iyer, Matthew;Maher, Christopher A;Grasso, Catherine S;Lonigro, Robert J;Quist, Michael;Siddiqui, Javed;Mehra, Rohit;Jing, Xiaojun;Giordano, Thomas J;Sabel, Michael S;Kleer, Celina G;Palanisamy, Nallasivam;Natrajan, Rachael;Lambros, Maryou B;Reis-Filho, Jorge S;Kumar-Sinha, Chandan;Chinnaiyan, Arul M"

Here we show crosstalk between oxidative stress and the miR-200 family of microRNAs that affects tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity. miR-141 and miR-200a target p38α and modulate the oxidative stress response. Enhanced expression of these microRNAs mimics p38α deficiency and increases tumor growth in mouse models, but it also improves the response to chemotherapeutic agents. High-grade human ovarian adenocarcinomas that accumulate miR-200a have low concentrations of p38α and an associated oxidative stress signature. The miR200a-dependent stress signature correlates with improved survival of patients in response to treatment. Therefore, the role of miR-200a in stress could be a predictive marker for clinical outcome in ovarian cancer. In addition, although oxidative stress promotes tumor growth, it also sensitizes tumors to treatment, which could account for the limited success of antioxidants in clinical trials.","Mateescu, Bogdan;Batista, Luciana;Cardon, Melissa;Gruosso, Tina;de Feraudy, Yvan;Mariani, Odette;Nicolas, André;Meyniel, Jean-Philippe;Cottu, Paul;Sastre-Garau, Xavier;Mechta-Grigoriou, Fatima"
22081024,2011,Nature medicine,A MEK-independent role for CRAF in mitosis and tumor progression.,"RAF kinases regulate cell proliferation and survival and can be dysregulated in tumors. The role of RAF in cell proliferation has been linked to its ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK). Here we identify a MEK-independent role for RAF in tumor growth. Specifically, in mitotic cells, CRAF becomes phosphorylated on Ser338 and localizes to the mitotic spindle of proliferating tumor cells in vitro as well as in murine tumor models and in biopsies from individuals with cancer. Treatment of tumors with allosteric inhibitors, but not ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors, prevents CRAF phosphorylation on Ser338 and localization to the mitotic spindle and causes cell-cycle arrest at prometaphase. Furthermore, we identify phospho-Ser338 CRAF as a potential biomarker for tumor progression and a surrogate marker for allosteric RAF blockade. Mechanistically, CRAF, but not BRAF, associates with Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) at the centrosomes and spindle poles during G2/M. Indeed, allosteric or genetic inhibition of phospho-Ser338 CRAF impairs Plk1 activation and accumulation at the kinetochores, causing prometaphase arrest, whereas a phospho-mimetic Ser338D CRAF mutant potentiates Plk1 activation, mitosis and tumor progression in mice. These findings show a previously undefined role for RAF in tumor progression beyond the RAF-MEK-ERK paradigm, opening new avenues for targeting RAF in cancer.","Mielgo, Ainhoa;Seguin, Laetitia;Huang, Miller;Camargo, Maria Fernanda;Anand, Sudarshan;Franovic, Aleksandra;Weis, Sara M;Advani, Sunil J;Murphy, Eric A;Cheresh, David A"

In this study, we have developed a new type of molecular-targeted cancer therapy, photoimmunotherapy (PIT), that uses a target-specific photosensitizer based on a near-infrared (NIR) phthalocyanine dye, IR700, conjugated to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptors. Cell death was induced immediately after irradiating mAb-IR700-bound target cells with NIR light. We observed in vivo tumor shrinkage after irradiation with NIR light in target cells expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor. The mAb-IR700 conjugates were most effective when bound to the cell membrane and produced no phototoxicity when not bound, suggesting a different mechanism for PIT as compared to conventional photodynamic therapies. Target-selective PIT enables treatment of cancer based on mAb binding to the cell membrane.","Mitsunaga, Makoto;Ogawa, Mikako;Kosaka, Nobuyuki;Rosenblum, Lauren T;Choyke, Peter L;Kobayashi, Hisataka"
22037646,2011,Nature medicine,Adipocytes promote ovarian cancer metastasis and provide energy for rapid tumor growth.,"Intra-abdominal tumors, such as ovarian cancer, have a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, an organ primarily composed of adipocytes. Currently, it is unclear why tumor cells preferentially home to and proliferate in the omentum, yet omental metastases typically represent the largest tumor in the abdominal cavities of women with ovarian cancer. We show here that primary human omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that adipokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediate these activities. Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, coculture induced lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in cancer cells, suggesting adipocytes act as an energy source for the cancer cells. A protein array identified upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) in omental metastases as compared to primary ovarian tumors, and FABP4 expression was detected in ovarian cancer cells at the adipocyte-tumor cell interface. FABP4 deficiency substantially impaired metastatic tumor growth in mice, indicating that FABP4 has a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis. These data indicate adipocytes provide fatty acids for rapid tumor growth, identifying lipid metabolism and transport as new targets for the treatment of cancers where adipocytes are a major component of the microenvironment.","Nieman, Kristin M;Kenny, Hilary A;Penicka, Carla V;Ladanyi, Andras;Buell-Gutbrod, Rebecca;Zillhardt, Marion R;Romero, Iris L;Carey, Mark S;Mills, Gordon B;Hotamisligil, Gökhan S;Yamada, S Diane;Peter, Marcus E;Gwin, Katja;Lengyel, Ernst"

Using a mouse model in which deletion of Rb1 and Trp53 in the lung epithelium of adult mice induces SCLC, we found that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is activated in SCLC cells independently of the lung microenvironment. Constitutive activation of the Hedgehog signaling molecule Smoothened (Smo) promoted the clonogenicity of human SCLC in vitro and the initiation and progression of mouse SCLC in vivo. Reciprocally, deletion of Smo in Rb1 and Trp53-mutant lung epithelial cells strongly suppressed SCLC initiation and progression in mice. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of Hedgehog signaling inhibited the growth of mouse and human SCLC, most notably following chemotherapy. These findings show a crucial cell-intrinsic role for Hedgehog signaling in the development and maintenance of SCLC and identify Hedgehog pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of disease and delay cancer recurrence in individuals with SCLC.","Park, Kwon-Sik;Martelotto, Luciano G;Peifer, Martin;Sos, Martin L;Karnezis, Anthony N;Mahjoub, Moe R;Bernard, Katie;Conklin, Jamie F;Szczepny, Anette;Yuan, Jing;Guo, Ribo;Ospina, Beatrice;Falzon, Jeanette;Bennett, Samara;Brown, Tracey J;Markovic, Ana;Devereux, Wendy L;Ocasio, Cory A;Chen, James K;Stearns, Tim;Thomas, Roman K;Dorsch, Marion;Buonamici, Silvia;Watkins, D Neil;Peacock, Craig D;Sage, Julien"

We identified a mutant of HSP110 (HSP110ΔE9) in colorectal cancer showing microsatellite instability (MSI CRC), generated from an aberrantly spliced mRNA and lacking the HSP110 substrate-binding domain. This mutant was expressed at variable levels in almost all MSI CRC cell lines and primary tumors tested. HSP110ΔE9 impaired both the normal cellular localization of HSP110 and its interaction with other HSPs, thus abrogating the chaperone activity and antiapoptotic function of HSP110 in a dominant-negative manner. HSP110ΔE9 overexpression caused the sensitization of cells to anticancer agents such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, which are routinely prescribed in the adjuvant treatment of people with CRC. The survival and response to chemotherapy of subjects with MSI CRCs was associated with the tumor expression level of HSP110ΔE9.

We found that leukemia cells from a substantial proportion of children (∼11%) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia have low or undetectable MSH2 protein levels, despite abundant wild-type MSH2 mRNA. Leukemia cells with low levels of MSH2 contained partial or complete somatic deletions of one to four genes that regulate MSH2 degradation (FRAP1 (also known as MTOR), HERC1, PRKCZ and PIK3C2B); we also found these deletions in individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16%) and sporadic colorectal cancer (13.5%). Knockdown of these genes in human leukemia cells recapitulated the MSH2 protein deficiency by enhancing MSH2 degradation, leading to substantial reduction in DNA mismatch repair and increased resistance to thiopurines. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby somatic deletions of genes regulating MSH2 degradation result in undetectable levels of MSH2 protein in leukemia cells, DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance.","Diouf, Barthelemy;Cheng, Qing;Krynetskaia, Natalia F;Yang, Wenjian;Cheok, Meyling;Pei, Deqing;Fan, Yiping;Cheng, Cheng;Krynetskiy, Evgeny Y;Geng, Hui;Chen, Siying;Thierfelder, William E;Mullighan, Charles G;Downing, James R;Hsieh, Peggy;Pui, Ching-Hon;Relling, Mary V;Evans, William E"

Tumor-specific intraoperative fluorescence imaging may improve staging and debulking efforts in cytoreductive surgery and thereby improve prognosis. The overexpression of folate receptor-α (FR-α) in 90-95% of epithelial ovarian cancers prompted the investigation of intraoperative tumor-specific fluorescence imaging in ovarian cancer surgery using an FR-α-targeted fluorescent agent. In patients with ovarian cancer, intraoperative tumor-specific fluorescence imaging with an FR-α-targeted fluorescent agent showcased the potential applications in patients with ovarian cancer for improved intraoperative staging and more radical cytoreductive surgery.","van Dam, Gooitzen M;Themelis, George;Crane, Lucia M A;Harlaar, Niels J;Pleijhuis, Rick G;Kelder, Wendy;Sarantopoulos, Athanasios;de Jong, Johannes S;Arts, Henriette J G;van der Zee, Ate G J;Bart, Joost;Low, Philip S;Ntziachristos, Vasilis"
21909104,2011,Nature medicine,Glutamate release by primary brain tumors induces epileptic activity.,"Epileptic seizures are a common and poorly understood comorbidity for individuals with primary brain tumors. To investigate peritumoral seizure etiology, we implanted human-derived glioma cells into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Within 14-18 d, glioma-bearing mice developed spontaneous and recurring abnormal electroencephalogram events consistent with progressive epileptic activity. Acute brain slices from these mice showed marked glutamate release from the tumor mediated by the system x(c)(-) cystine-glutamate transporter (encoded by Slc7a11). Biophysical and optical recordings showed glutamatergic epileptiform hyperexcitability that spread into adjacent brain tissue. We inhibited glutamate release from the tumor and the ensuing hyperexcitability by sulfasalazine (SAS), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that blocks system x(c)(-). We found that acute administration of SAS at concentrations equivalent to those used to treat Crohn's disease in humans reduced epileptic event frequency in tumor-bearing mice compared with untreated controls. SAS should be considered as an adjuvant treatment to ameliorate peritumoral seizures associated with glioma in humans.","Buckingham, Susan C;Campbell, Susan L;Haas, Brian R;Montana, Vedrana;Robel, Stefanie;Ogunrinu, Toyin;Sontheimer, Harald"
21873989,2011,Nature medicine,Imatinib potentiates antitumor T cell responses in gastrointestinal stromal tumor through the inhibition of Ido.,"Imatinib mesylate targets mutated KIT oncoproteins in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and produces a clinical response in 80% of patients. The mechanism is believed to depend predominantly on the inhibition of KIT-driven signals for tumor-cell survival and proliferation. Using a mouse model of spontaneous GIST, we found that the immune system contributes substantially to the antitumor effects of imatinib. Imatinib therapy activated CD8(+) T cells and induced regulatory T cell (T(reg) cell) apoptosis within the tumor by reducing tumor-cell expression of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Ido). Concurrent immunotherapy augmented the efficacy of imatinib in mouse GIST. In freshly obtained human GIST specimens, the T cell profile correlated with imatinib sensitivity and IDO expression. Thus, T cells are crucial to the antitumor effects of imatinib in GIST, and concomitant immunotherapy may further improve outcomes in human cancers treated with targeted agents.","Balachandran, Vinod P;Cavnar, Michael J;Zeng, Shan;Bamboat, Zubin M;Ocuin, Lee M;Obaid, Hebroon;Sorenson, Eric C;Popow, Rachel;Ariyan, Charlotte;Rossi, Ferdinand;Besmer, Peter;Guo, Tianhua;Antonescu, Cristina R;Taguchi, Takahiro;Yuan, Jianda;Wolchok, Jedd D;Allison, James P;DeMatteo, Ronald P"
21873988,2011,Nature medicine,Stem cell gene expression programs influence clinical outcome in human leukemia.,"Xenograft studies indicate that some solid tumors and leukemias are organized as cellular hierarchies sustained by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Despite the promise of the CSC model, its relevance in humans remains uncertain. Here we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) follows a CSC model on the basis of sorting multiple populations from each of 16 primary human AML samples and identifying which contain leukemia stem cells (LSCs) using a sensitive xenograft assay. Analysis of gene expression from all functionally validated populations yielded an LSC-specific signature. Similarly, a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene signature was established. Bioinformatic analysis identified a core transcriptional program shared by LSCs and HSCs, revealing the molecular machinery underlying 'stemness' properties. Both stem cell programs were highly significant independent predictors of patient survival and were found in existing prognostic signatures. Thus, determinants of stemness influence the clinical outcome of AML, establishing that LSCs are clinically relevant and not artifacts of xenotransplantation.","Eppert, Kolja;Takenaka, Katsuto;Lechman, Eric R;Waldron, Levi;Nilsson, Björn;van Galen, Peter;Metzeler, Klaus H;Poeppl, Armando;Ling, Vicki;Beyene, Joseph;Canty, Angelo J;Danska, Jayne S;Bohlander, Stefan K;Buske, Christian;Minden, Mark D;Golub, Todd R;Jurisica, Igor;Ebert, Benjamin L;Dick, John E"
21822287,2011,Nature medicine,Oncogenic PIK3CA-driven mammary tumors frequently recur via PI3K pathway-dependent and PI3K pathway-independent mechanisms.,"PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations are a common oncogenic event in human malignancy, making phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) a target for cancer therapy. Despite the promise of targeted therapy, resistance often develops, leading to treatment failure. To elucidate mechanisms of resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy, we constructed a mouse model of breast cancer conditionally expressing human PIK3CA(H1047R). Notably, most PIK3CA(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors recurred after PIK3CA(H1047R) inactivation. Genomic analyses of recurrent tumors revealed multiple lesions, including focal amplification of Met or Myc (also known as c-Met and c-Myc, respectively). Whereas Met amplification led to tumor survival dependent on activation of endogenous PI3K, tumors with Myc amplification became independent of the PI3K pathway. Functional analyses showed that Myc contributed to oncogene independence and resistance to PI3K inhibition. Notably, PIK3CA mutations and c-MYC elevation co-occur in a substantial fraction of human breast tumors. Together, these data suggest that c-MYC elevation represents a potential mechanism by which tumors develop resistance to current PI3K-targeted therapies.","Liu, Pixu;Cheng, Hailing;Santiago, Stephanie;Raeder, Maria;Zhang, Fan;Isabella, Adam;Yang, Janet;Semaan, Derek J;Chen, Changzhong;Fox, Edward A;Gray, Nathanael S;Monahan, John;Schlegel, Robert;Beroukhim, Rameen;Mills, Gordon B;Zhao, Jean J"
21822286,2011,Nature medicine,Direct targeting of Sec23a by miR-200s influences cancer cell secretome and promotes metastatic colonization.,"Although the role of miR-200s in regulating E-cadherin expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is well established, their influence on metastatic colonization remains controversial. Here we have used clinical and experimental models of breast cancer metastasis to discover a pro-metastatic role of miR-200s that goes beyond their regulation of E-cadherin and epithelial phenotype. Overexpression of miR-200s is associated with increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer and promotes metastatic colonization in mouse models, phenotypes that cannot be recapitulated by E-cadherin expression alone. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed global shifts in gene expression upon miR-200 overexpression toward that of highly metastatic cells. miR-200s promote metastatic colonization partly through direct targeting of Sec23a, which mediates secretion of metastasis-suppressive proteins, including Igfbp4 and Tinagl1, as validated by functional and clinical correlation studies. Overall, these findings suggest a pleiotropic role of miR-200s in promoting metastatic colonization by influencing E-cadherin-dependent epithelial traits and Sec23a-mediated tumor cell secretome.","Korpal, Manav;Ell, Brian J;Buffa, Francesca M;Ibrahim, Toni;Blanco, Mario A;Celià-Terrassa, Toni;Mercatali, Laura;Khan, Zia;Goodarzi, Hani;Hua, Yuling;Wei, Yong;Hu, Guohong;Garcia, Benjamin A;Ragoussis, Jiannis;Amadori, Dino;Harris, Adrian L;Kang, Yibin"
21822285,2011,Nature medicine,Postpartum mammary gland involution drives progression of ductal carcinoma in situ through collagen and COX-2.,"The prognosis of breast cancer in young women is influenced by reproductive history. Women diagnosed within 5 years postpartum have worse prognosis than nulliparous women or women diagnosed during pregnancy. Here we describe a mouse model of postpartum breast cancer that identifies mammary gland involution as a driving force of tumor progression. In this model, human breast cancer cells exposed to the involuting mammary microenvironment form large tumors that are characterized by abundant fibrillar collagen, high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and an invasive phenotype. In culture, tumor cells are invasive in a fibrillar collagen and COX-2-dependent manner. In the involuting mammary gland, inhibition of COX-2 reduces the collagen fibrillogenesis associated with involution, as well as tumor growth and tumor cell infiltration to the lung. These data support further research to determine whether women at high risk for postpartum breast cancer would benefit from treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during postpartum involution.","Lyons, Traci R;O'Brien, Jenean;Borges, Virginia F;Conklin, Matthew W;Keely, Patricia J;Eliceiri, Kevin W;Marusyk, Andriy;Tan, Aik-Choon;Schedin, Pepper"
21804542,2011,Nature medicine,Regulation of the MDM2-P53 pathway and tumor growth by PICT1 via nucleolar RPL11.,"PICT1 (also known as GLTSCR2) is considered a tumor suppressor because it stabilizes phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), but individuals with oligodendrogliomas lacking chromosome 19q13, where PICT1 is located, have better prognoses than other oligodendroglioma patients. To clarify the function of PICT1, we generated Pict1-deficient mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Pict1 is a nucleolar protein essential for embryogenesis and ES cell survival. Even without DNA damage, Pict1 loss led to p53-dependent arrest of cell cycle phase G(1) and apoptosis. Pict1-deficient cells accumulated p53, owing to impaired Mdm2 function. Pict1 binds Rpl11, and Rpl11 is released from nucleoli in the absence of Pict1. In Pict1-deficient cells, increased binding of Rpl11 to Mdm2 blocks Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. In human cancer, individuals whose tumors express less PICT1 have better prognoses. When PICT1 is depleted in tumor cells with intact P53 signaling, the cells grow more slowly and accumulate P53. Thus, PICT1 is a potent regulator of the MDM2-P53 pathway and promotes tumor progression by retaining RPL11 in the nucleolus.","Sasaki, Masato;Kawahara, Kohichi;Nishio, Miki;Mimori, Koshi;Kogo, Ryunosuke;Hamada, Koichi;Itoh, Bunsho;Wang, Jia;Komatsu, Yukako;Yang, Yong Ryoul;Hikasa, Hiroki;Horie, Yasuo;Yamashita, Takayuki;Kamijo, Takehiko;Zhang, Yanping;Zhu, Yan;Prives, Carol;Nakano, Toru;Mak, Tak Wah;Sasaki, Takehiko;Maehama, Tomohiko;Mori, Masaki;Suzuki, Akira"

We identified two variants at chromosome 6q21 associated with SMNs in survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with radiation therapy as children but not as adults. The variants comprise a risk locus associated with decreased basal expression of PRDM1 (encoding PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain) and impaired induction of the PRDM1 protein after radiation exposure.

21725296,2011,Nature medicine,Caspase 3-mediated stimulation of tumor cell repopulation during cancer radiotherapy.,"In cancer treatment, apoptosis is a well-recognized cell death mechanism through which cytotoxic agents kill tumor cells. Here we report that dying tumor cells use the apoptotic process to generate potent growth-stimulating signals to stimulate the repopulation of tumors undergoing radiotherapy. Furthermore, activated caspase 3, a key executioner in apoptosis, is involved in the growth stimulation. One downstream effector that caspase 3 regulates is prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which can potently stimulate growth of surviving tumor cells. Deficiency of caspase 3 either in tumor cells or in tumor stroma caused substantial tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy in xenograft or mouse tumors. In human subjects with cancer, higher amounts of activated caspase 3 in tumor tissues are correlated with markedly increased rate of recurrence and death. We propose the existence of a cell death-induced tumor repopulation pathway in which caspase 3 has a major role.","Huang, Qian;Li, Fang;Liu, Xinjian;Li, Wenrong;Shi, Wei;Liu, Fei-Fei;O'Sullivan, Brian;He, Zhimin;Peng, Yuanlin;Tan, Aik-Choon;Zhou, Ling;Shen, Jingping;Han, Gangwen;Wang, Xiao-Jing;Thorburn, Jackie;Thorburn, Andrew;Jimeno, Antonio;Raben, David;Bedford, Joel S;Li, Chuan-Yuan"
21706030,2011,Nature medicine,Compromised CDK1 activity sensitizes BRCA-proficient cancers to PARP inhibition.,"Cells that are deficient in homologous recombination, such as those that lack functional breast cancer-associated 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2, are hypersensitive to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, BRCA-deficient tumors represent only a small fraction of adult cancers, which might restrict the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylates BRCA1, and this is essential for efficient formation of BRCA1 foci. Here we show that depletion or inhibition of Cdk1 compromises the ability of cells to repair DNA by homologous recombination. Combined inhibition of Cdk1 and PARP in BRCA-wild-type cancer cells resulted in reduced colony formation, delayed growth of human tumor xenografts and tumor regression with prolonged survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of Cdk1 did not sensitize nontransformed cells or tissues to inhibition of PARP. Because reduced Cdk1 activity impaired BRCA1 function and consequently, repair by homologous recombination, inhibition of Cdk1 represents a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of PARP inhibitors to BRCA-proficient cancers.","Johnson, Neil;Li, Yu-Chen;Walton, Zandra E;Cheng, Katherine A;Li, Danan;Rodig, Scott J;Moreau, Lisa A;Unitt, Christine;Bronson, Roderick T;Thomas, Huw D;Newell, David R;D'Andrea, Alan D;Curtin, Nicola J;Wong, Kwok-Kin;Shapiro, Geoffrey I"
21706029,2011,Nature medicine,Breast cancer cells produce tenascin C as a metastatic niche component to colonize the lungs.,"We report that breast cancer cells that infiltrate the lungs support their own metastasis-initiating ability by expressing tenascin C (TNC). We find that the expression of TNC, an extracellular matrix protein of stem cell niches, is associated with the aggressiveness of pulmonary metastasis. Cancer cell-derived TNC promotes the survival and outgrowth of pulmonary micrometastases. TNC enhances the expression of stem cell signaling components, musashi homolog 1 (MSI1) and leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). MSI1 is a positive regulator of NOTCH signaling, whereas LGR5 is a target gene of the WNT pathway. TNC modulation of stem cell signaling occurs without affecting the expression of transcriptional enforcers of the stem cell phenotype and pluripotency, namely nanog homeobox (NANOG), POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1), also known as OCT4, and SRY-box 2 (SOX2). TNC protects MSI1-dependent NOTCH signaling from inhibition by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), and selectively enhances the expression of LGR5 as a WNT target gene. Cancer cell-derived TNC remains essential for metastasis outgrowth until the tumor stroma takes over as a source of TNC. These findings link TNC to pathways that support the fitness of metastasis-initiating breast cancer cells and highlight the relevance of TNC as an extracellular matrix component of the metastatic niche.","Oskarsson, Thordur;Acharyya, Swarnali;Zhang, Xiang H-F;Vanharanta, Sakari;Tavazoie, Sohail F;Morris, Patrick G;Downey, Robert J;Manova-Todorova, Katia;Brogi, Edi;Massagué, Joan"
21685898,2011,Nature medicine,Broad antigenic coverage induced by vaccination with virus-based cDNA libraries cures established tumors.,"Effective cancer immunotherapy requires the release of a broad spectrum of tumor antigens in the context of potent immune activation. We show here that a cDNA library of normal tissue, expressed from a highly immunogenic viral platform, cures established tumors of the same histological type from which the cDNA library was derived. Immune escape occurred with suboptimal vaccination, but tumor cells that escaped the immune pressure were readily treated by second-line virus-based immunotherapy. This approach has several major advantages. Use of the cDNA library leads to presentation of a broad repertoire of (undefined) tumor-associated antigens, which reduces emergence of treatment-resistant variants and also permits rational, combined-modality approaches in the clinic. Finally, the viral vectors can be delivered systemically, without the need for tumor targeting, and are amenable to clinical-grade production. Therefore, virus-expressed cDNA libraries represent a novel paradigm for cancer treatment addressing many of the key issues that have undermined the efficacy of immuno- and virotherapy to date.","Kottke, Timothy;Errington, Fiona;Pulido, Jose;Galivo, Feorillo;Thompson, Jill;Wongthida, Phonphimon;Diaz, Rosa Maria;Chong, Heung;Ilett, Elizabeth;Chester, John;Pandha, Hardev;Harrington, Kevin;Selby, Peter;Melcher, Alan;Vile, Richard"
21602804,2011,Nature medicine,Kinome screening for regulators of the estrogen receptor identifies LMTK3 as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.,"Therapies targeting estrogen receptor α (ERα, encoded by ESR1) have transformed the treatment of breast cancer. However, large numbers of women relapse, highlighting the need for the discovery of new regulatory targets modulating ERα pathways. An siRNA screen identified kinases whose silencing alters the estrogen response including those previously implicated in regulating ERα activity (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT). Among the most potent regulators was lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3), for which a role has not previously been assigned. In contrast to other modulators of ERα activity, LMTK3 seems to have been subject to Darwinian positive selection, a noteworthy result given the unique susceptibility of humans to ERα+ breast cancer. LMTK3 acts by decreasing the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), thereby increasing binding of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to the ESR1 promoter. LMTK3 phosphorylated ERα, protecting it from proteasomal degradation in vitro. Silencing of LMTK3 reduced tumor volume in an orthotopic mouse model and abrogated proliferation of ERα+ but not ERα- cells, indicative of its role in ERα activity. In human cancers, LMTK3 abundance and intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival and predicted response to endocrine therapies. These findings yield insights into the natural history of breast cancer in humans and reveal LMTK3 as a new therapeutic target.","Giamas, Georgios;Filipović, Aleksandra;Jacob, Jimmy;Messier, Walter;Zhang, Hua;Yang, Dongyun;Zhang, Wu;Shifa, Belul Assefa;Photiou, Andrew;Tralau-Stewart, Cathy;Castellano, Leandro;Green, Andrew R;Coombes, R Charles;Ellis, Ian O;Ali, Simak;Lenz, Heinz-Josef;Stebbing, Justin"

Although reduced expression of estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) is a known contributing factor to endocrine resistance, the mechanism of ER-α downregulation in endocrine resistance is still not fully understood. Here we report that CUE domain-containing protein-2 (CUEDC2), a ubiquitin-binding motif-containing protein, is a key factor in endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that CUEDC2 modulates ER-α protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Through the study of specimens from a large cohort of subjects with breast cancer, we found a strong inverse correlation between CUEDC2 and ER-α protein expression. Notably, subjects with tumors that highly expressed CUEDC2 had poor responsiveness to tamoxifen treatment and high potential for relapse. We further show that ectopic CUEDC2 expression impaired the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Therefore, our findings suggest that CUEDC2 is a crucial determinant of resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer.","Pan, Xin;Zhou, Tao;Tai, Yan-Hong;Wang, Chenguang;Zhao, Jie;Cao, Yuan;Chen, Yuan;Zhang, Pei-Jing;Yu, Ming;Zhen, Cheng;Mu, Rui;Bai, Zhao-Fang;Li, Hui-Yan;Li, Ai-Ling;Liang, Bing;Jian, Zhao;Zhang, Wei-Na;Man, Jiang-Hong;Gao, Yan-Fei;Gong, Wei-Li;Wei, Li-Xin;Zhang, Xue-Min"

Here we describe the influence of three NKp30 splice variants on the prognosis of gastrointestinal sarcoma (GIST), a malignancy that expresses NKp30 ligands and that is treated with NK-stimulatory KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Healthy individuals and those with GIST show distinct patterns of transcription of functionally different NKp30 isoforms. In a retrospective analysis of 80 individuals with GIST, predominant expression of the immunosuppressive NKp30c isoform (over the immunostimulatory NKp30a and NKp30b isoforms) was associated with reduced survival of subjects, decreased NKp30-dependent tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and CD107a release, and defective interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion in the NK-DC cross-talk that could be restored by blocking of IL-10. Preferential NKp30c expression resulted partly from a single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3790 in the 3' untranslated region of the gene encoding NKp30.

Overall survival is typically 6 months from diagnosis. Numerous phase 3 trials of agents effective in other malignancies have failed to benefit unselected PDA populations, although patients do occasionally respond. Studies in other solid tumors have shown that heterogeneity in response is determined, in part, by molecular differences between tumors. Furthermore, treatment outcomes are improved by targeting drugs to tumor subtypes in which they are selectively effective, with breast and lung cancers providing recent examples. Identification of PDA molecular subtypes has been frustrated by a paucity of tumor specimens available for study. We have overcome this problem by combined analysis of transcriptional profiles of primary PDA samples from several studies, along with human and mouse PDA cell lines. We define three PDA subtypes: classical, quasimesenchymal and exocrine-like, and we present evidence for clinical outcome and therapeutic response differences between them.

We show that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC) is a key modulator of trastuzumab response and a common node downstream of multiple trastuzumab resistance pathways. We find that SRC is activated in both acquired and de novo trastuzumab-resistant cells and uncover a novel mechanism of SRC regulation involving dephosphorylation by PTEN. Increased SRC activation conferred considerable trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells and correlated with trastuzumab resistance in patients. Targeting SRC in combination with trastuzumab sensitized multiple lines of trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab and eliminated trastuzumab-resistant tumors in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.","Zhang, Siyuan;Huang, Wen-Chien;Li, Ping;Guo, Hua;Poh, Say-Bee;Brady, Samuel W;Xiong, Yan;Tseng, Ling-Ming;Li, Shau-Hsuan;Ding, Zhaoxi;Sahin, Aysegul A;Esteva, Francisco J;Hortobagyi, Gabriel N;Yu, Dihua"

21240262,2011,Nature medicine,The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs), or tumor-initiating cells, are involved in tumor progression and metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate both normal stem cells and CSCs, and dysregulation of miRNAs has been implicated in tumorigenesis. CSCs in many tumors--including cancers of the breast, pancreas, head and neck, colon, small intestine, liver, stomach, bladder and ovary--have been identified using the adhesion molecule CD44, either individually or in combination with other marker(s). Prostate CSCs with enhanced clonogenic and tumor-initiating and metastatic capacities are enriched in the CD44(+) cell population, but whether miRNAs regulate CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here we show, through expression analysis, that miR-34a, a p53 target, was underexpressed in CD44(+) prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft and primary tumors. Enforced expression of miR-34a in bulk or purified CD44(+) prostate cancer cells inhibited clonogenic expansion, tumor regeneration, and metastasis. In contrast, expression of miR-34a antagomirs in CD44(-) prostate cancer cells promoted tumor development and metastasis. Systemically delivered miR-34a inhibited prostate cancer metastasis and extended survival of tumor-bearing mice. We identified and validated CD44 as a direct and functional target of miR-34a and found that CD44 knockdown phenocopied miR-34a overexpression in inhibiting prostate cancer regeneration and metastasis. Our study shows that miR-34a is a key negative regulator of CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and establishes a strong rationale for developing miR-34a as a novel therapeutic agent against prostate CSCs.","Liu, Can;Kelnar, Kevin;Liu, Bigang;Chen, Xin;Calhoun-Davis, Tammy;Li, Hangwen;Patrawala, Lubna;Yan, Hong;Jeter, Collene;Honorio, Sofia;Wiggins, Jason F;Bader, Andreas G;Fagin, Randy;Brown, David;Tang, Dean G"
21170048,2011,Nature medicine,Differentiation between glioma and radiation necrosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging of endogenous proteins and peptides.,"It remains difficult to distinguish tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis after brain tumor therapy. Here we show that these lesions can be distinguished using the amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals of endogenous cellular proteins and peptides as an imaging biomarker. When comparing two models of orthotopic glioma (SF188/V+ glioma and 9L gliosarcoma) with a model of radiation necrosis in rats, we could clearly differentiate viable glioma (hyperintense) from radiation necrosis (hypointense to isointense) by APT MRI. When we irradiated rats with U87MG gliomas, the APT signals in the irradiated tumors had decreased substantially by 3 d and 6 d after radiation. The amide protons that can be detected by APT provide a unique and noninvasive MRI biomarker for distinguishing viable malignancy from radiation necrosis and predicting tumor response to therapy.","Zhou, Jinyuan;Tryggestad, Erik;Wen, Zhibo;Lal, Bachchu;Zhou, Tingting;Grossman, Rachel;Wang, Silun;Yan, Kun;Fu, De-Xue;Ford, Eric;Tyler, Betty;Blakeley, Jaishri;Laterra, John;van Zijl, Peter C M"
21170045,2011,Nature medicine,Histamine deficiency promotes inflammation-associated carcinogenesis through reduced myeloid maturation and accumulation of CD11b+Ly6G+ immature myeloid cells.,"Histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the unique enzyme responsible for histamine generation, is highly expressed in myeloid cells, but its function in these cells is poorly understood. Here we show that Hdc-knockout mice show a high rate of colon and skin carcinogenesis. Using Hdc-EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice in which EGFP expression is controlled by the Hdc promoter, we show that Hdc is expressed primarily in CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) immature myeloid cells (IMCs) that are recruited early on in chemical carcinogenesis. Transplant of Hdc-deficient bone marrow to wild-type recipients results in increased CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cell mobilization and reproduces the cancer susceptibility phenotype of Hdc-knockout mice. In addition, Hdc-deficient IMCs promote the growth of tumor allografts, whereas mouse CT26 colon cancer cells downregulate Hdc expression through promoter hypermethylation and inhibit myeloid cell maturation. Exogenous histamine induces the differentiation of IMCs and suppresses their ability to support the growth of tumor allografts. These data indicate key roles for Hdc and histamine in myeloid cell differentiation and CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) IMCs in early cancer development.","Yang, Xiang Dong;Ai, Walden;Asfaha, Samuel;Bhagat, Govind;Friedman, Richard A;Jin, Guangchun;Park, Heuijoon;Shykind, Benjamin;Diacovo, Thomas G;Falus, Andras;Wang, Timothy C"
21151140,2011,Nature medicine,Tumor-specific imaging through progression elevated gene-3 promoter-driven gene expression.,"Molecular-genetic imaging is advancing from a valuable preclinical tool to a guide for patient management. The strategy involves pairing an imaging reporter gene with a complementary imaging agent in a system that can be used to measure gene expression or protein interaction or track gene-tagged cells in vivo. Tissue-specific promoters can be used to delineate gene expression in certain tissues, particularly when coupled with an appropriate amplification mechanism. Here we show that the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3) promoter, derived from a rodent gene mediating tumor progression and metastatic phenotypes, can be used to drive imaging reporters selectively to enable detection of micrometastatic disease in mouse models of human melanoma and breast cancer using bioluminescence and radionuclide-based molecular imaging techniques. Because of its strong promoter activity, tumor specificity and capacity for clinical translation, PEG-3 promoter-driven gene expression may represent a practical, new system for facilitating cancer imaging and therapy.","Bhang, Hyo-eun C;Gabrielson, Kathleen L;Laterra, John;Fisher, Paul B;Pomper, Martin G"

Here we use tumor-associated genetic pathways to transform primary human epithelial cells from the epidermis, oropharynx, esophagus and cervix into genetically defined tumors in a human three-dimensional (3D) tissue environment that incorporates cell-populated stroma and intact basement membrane. These engineered organotypic tissues recapitulated natural features of tumor progression, including epithelial invasion through basement membrane, a complex process that is necessary for biological malignancy in 90% of human cancers. Invasion was rapid and was potentiated by stromal cells. Oncogenic signals in 3D tissue, but not 2D culture, resembled gene expression profiles from spontaneous human cancers. We screened 3D organotypic neoplasia with well-characterized signaling pathway inhibitors to distill a clinically faithful cancer gene signature. Multitissue 3D human tissue cancer models may provide an efficient and relevant complement to current approaches to characterizing cancer progression.","Ridky, Todd W;Chow, Jennifer M;Wong, David J;Khavari, Paul A"
21102457,2010,Nature medicine,STAT3-induced S1PR1 expression is crucial for persistent STAT3 activation in tumors.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-Janus kinase (JAK) signaling is viewed as crucial for persistent signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activation in cancer. However, IL-6-induced STAT3 activation is normally transient. Here we identify a key mechanism for persistent STAT3 activation in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. We show that expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1), a G protein-coupled receptor for the lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is elevated in STAT3-positive tumors. STAT3 is a transcription factor for the S1pr1 gene. Reciprocally, enhanced S1pr1 expression activates STAT3 and upregulates Il6 gene expression, thereby accelerating tumor growth and metastasis in a STAT3-dependent manner. Silencing S1pr1 in tumor cells or immune cells inhibits tumor STAT3 activity, tumor growth and metastasis. S1P-S1PR1-induced STAT3 activation is persistent, in contrast to transient STAT3 activation by IL-6. S1PR1 activates STAT3 in part by upregulating JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity. We show that STAT3-induced S1PR1 expression, as well as the S1P-S1PR1 pathway reciprocal regulation of STAT3 activity, is a major positive feedback loop for persistent STAT3 activation in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment and for malignant progression.","Lee, Heehyoung;Deng, Jiehui;Kujawski, Maciej;Yang, Chunmei;Liu, Yong;Herrmann, Andreas;Kortylewski, Marcin;Horne, David;Somlo, George;Forman, Stephen;Jove, Richard;Yu, Hua"
21076395,2010,Nature medicine,Loss of the tumor suppressor Snf5 leads to aberrant activation of the Hedgehog-Gli pathway.,"Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway can drive tumorigenesis. To investigate the mechanism by which glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 (GLI1), a crucial effector of Hh signaling, regulates Hh pathway activation, we searched for GLI1-interacting proteins. We report that the chromatin remodeling protein SNF5 (encoded by SMARCB1, hereafter called SNF5), which is inactivated in human malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), interacts with GLI1. We show that Snf5 localizes to Gli1-regulated promoters and that loss of Snf5 leads to activation of the Hh-Gli pathway. Conversely, re-expression of SNF5 in MRT cells represses GLI1. Consistent with this, we show the presence of a Hh-Gli-activated gene expression profile in primary MRTs and show that GLI1 drives the growth of SNF5-deficient MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our studies reveal that SNF5 is a key mediator of Hh signaling and that aberrant activation of GLI1 is a previously undescribed targetable mechanism contributing to the growth of MRT cells.","Jagani, Zainab;Mora-Blanco, E Lorena;Sansam, Courtney G;McKenna, Elizabeth S;Wilson, Boris;Chen, Dongshu;Klekota, Justin;Tamayo, Pablo;Nguyen, Phuong T L;Tolstorukov, Michael;Park, Peter J;Cho, Yoon-Jae;Hsiao, Kathy;Buonamici, Silvia;Pomeroy, Scott L;Mesirov, Jill P;Ruffner, Heinz;Bouwmeester, Tewis;Luchansky, Sarah J;Murtie, Joshua;Kelleher, Joseph F;Warmuth, Markus;Sellers, William R;Roberts, Charles W M;Dorsch, Marion"

Comparing gene expression in isogenic androgen-dependent and CRPC xenografts, we found a reproducible increase in N-cadherin expression, which was also elevated in primary and metastatic tumors of individuals with CRPC. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin-specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. These data indicate that N-cadherin is a major cause of both prostate cancer metastasis and castration resistance.

20972433,2010,Nature medicine,The TLX1 oncogene drives aneuploidy in T cell transformation.,"The TLX1 oncogene (encoding the transcription factor T cell leukemia homeobox protein-1) has a major role in the pathogenesis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, the specific mechanisms of T cell transformation downstream of TLX1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer.","De Keersmaecker, Kim;Real, Pedro J;Gatta, Giusy Della;Palomero, Teresa;Sulis, Maria Luisa;Tosello, Valeria;Van Vlierberghe, Pieter;Barnes, Kelly;Castillo, Mireia;Sole, Xavier;Hadler, Michael;Lenz, Jack;Aplan, Peter D;Kelliher, Michelle;Kee, Barbara L;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo;Kappes, Dietmar;Gounari, Fotini;Petrie, Howard;Van der Meulen, Joni;Speleman, Frank;Paietta, Elisabeth;Racevskis, Janis;Wiernik, Peter H;Rowe, Jacob M;Soulier, Jean;Avran, David;Cavé, Hélène;Dastugue, Nicole;Raimondi, Susana;Meijerink, Jules P P;Cordon-Cardo, Carlos;Califano, Andrea;Ferrando, Adolfo A"
20871609,2010,Nature medicine,miR-380-5p represses p53 to control cellular survival and is associated with poor outcome in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.,"Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway allows cell survival in times of stress and occurs in many human cancers; however, normal embryonic stem cells and some cancers such as neuroblastoma maintain wild-type human TP53 and mouse Trp53 (referred to collectively as p53 herein). Here we describe a miRNA, miR-380-5p, that represses p53 expression via a conserved sequence in the p53 3' untranslated region (UTR). miR-380-5p is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and neuroblastomas, and high expression correlates with poor outcome in neuroblastomas with neuroblastoma derived v-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene (MYCN) amplification. miR-380 overexpression cooperates with activated HRAS oncoprotein to transform primary cells, block oncogene-induced senescence and form tumors in mice. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-380-5p in embryonic stem or neuroblastoma cells results in induction of p53, and extensive apoptotic cell death. In vivo delivery of a miR-380-5p antagonist decreases tumor size in an orthotopic mouse model of neuroblastoma. We demonstrate a new mechanism of p53 regulation in cancer and stem cells and uncover a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.","Swarbrick, Alexander;Woods, Susan L;Shaw, Alexander;Balakrishnan, Asha;Phua, Yuwei;Nguyen, Akira;Chanthery, Yvan;Lim, Lionel;Ashton, Lesley J;Judson, Robert L;Huskey, Noelle;Blelloch, Robert;Haber, Michelle;Norris, Murray D;Lengyel, Peter;Hackett, Christopher S;Preiss, Thomas;Chetcuti, Albert;Sullivan, Christopher S;Marcusson, Eric G;Weiss, William;L'Etoile, Noelle;Goga, Andrei"

Here we report that a substantial proportion of DCs in tumor-bearing mice and people with cancer have high amounts of triglycerides as compared with DCs from tumor-free mice and healthy individuals. In our studies, lipid accumulation in DCs was caused by increased uptake of extracellular lipids due to upregulation of scavenger receptor A. DCs with high lipid content were not able to effectively stimulate allogeneic T cells or present tumor-associated antigens. DCs with high and normal lipid levels did not differ in expression of major histocompatibility complex and co-stimulatory molecules. However, lipid-laden DCs had a reduced capacity to process antigens. Pharmacological normalization of lipid abundance in DCs with an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase restored the functional activity of DCs and substantially enhanced the effects of cancer vaccines. These findings suggest that immune responses in cancer can be improved by manipulating the lipid levels in DCs.","Herber, Donna L;Cao, Wei;Nefedova, Yulia;Novitskiy, Sergey V;Nagaraj, Srinivas;Tyurin, Vladimir A;Corzo, Alex;Cho, Hyun-Il;Celis, Esteban;Lennox, Brianna;Knight, Stella C;Padhya, Tapan;McCaffrey, Thomas V;McCaffrey, Judith C;Antonia, Scott;Fishman, Mayer;Ferris, Robert L;Kagan, Valerian E;Gabrilovich, Dmitry I"

Here we demonstrate that Msi2 is the predominant form expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its knockdown leads to reduced engraftment and depletion of HSCs in vivo. Overexpression of human MSI2 in a mouse model increases HSC cell cycle progression and cooperates with the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to induce an aggressive leukemia. MSI2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemia cell lines, and its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Expression levels in human myeloid leukemia directly correlate with decreased survival in patients with the disease, thereby defining MSI2 expression as a new prognostic marker and as a new target for therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","Kharas, Michael G;Lengner, Christopher J;Al-Shahrour, Fatima;Bullinger, Lars;Ball, Brian;Zaidi, Samir;Morgan, Kelly;Tam, Winnie;Paktinat, Mahnaz;Okabe, Rachel;Gozo, Maricel;Einhorn, William;Lane, Steven W;Scholl, Claudia;Fröhling, Stefan;Fleming, Mark;Ebert, Benjamin L;Gilliland, D Gary;Jaenisch, Rudolf;Daley, George Q"
20581836,2010,Nature medicine,Validated prediction of clinical outcome in sarcomas and multiple types of cancer on the basis of a gene expression signature related to genome complexity.,"Sarcomas are heterogeneous and aggressive mesenchymal tumors. Histological grading has so far been the best predictor for metastasis-free survival, but it has several limitations, such as moderate reproducibility and poor prognostic value for some histological types. To improve patient grading, we performed genomic and expression profiling in a training set of 183 sarcomas and established a prognostic gene expression signature, complexity index in sarcomas (CINSARC), composed of 67 genes related to mitosis and chromosome management. In a multivariate analysis, CINSARC predicts metastasis outcome in the training set and in an independent 127 sarcomas validation set. It is superior to the Fédération Francaise des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grading system in determining metastatic outcome for sarcoma patients. Furthermore, it also predicts outcome for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), breast carcinomas and lymphomas. Application of the signature will permit more selective use of adjuvant therapies for people with sarcomas, leading to decreased iatrogenic morbidity and improved outcomes for such individuals.","Chibon, Frédéric;Lagarde, Pauline;Salas, Sébastien;Pérot, Gaëlle;Brouste, Véronique;Tirode, Franck;Lucchesi, Carlo;de Reynies, Aurélien;Kauffmann, Audrey;Bui, Binh;Terrier, Philippe;Bonvalot, Sylvie;Le Cesne, Axel;Vince-Ranchère, Dominique;Blay, Jean-Yves;Collin, Françoise;Guillou, Louis;Leroux, Agnès;Coindre, Jean-Michel;Aurias, Alain"

20526349,2010,Nature medicine,"Rearrangements of the RAF kinase pathway in prostate cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma.","Although recurrent gene fusions involving erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors are common in prostate cancer, their products are considered 'undruggable' by conventional approaches. Recently, rare targetable gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene, have been identified in 1-5% of lung cancers, suggesting that similar rare gene fusions may occur in other common epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement-negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1-v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion-harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types.","Palanisamy, Nallasivam;Ateeq, Bushra;Kalyana-Sundaram, Shanker;Pflueger, Dorothee;Ramnarayanan, Kalpana;Shankar, Sunita;Han, Bo;Cao, Qi;Cao, Xuhong;Suleman, Khalid;Kumar-Sinha, Chandan;Dhanasekaran, Saravana M;Chen, Ying-bei;Esgueva, Raquel;Banerjee, Samprit;LaFargue, Christopher J;Siddiqui, Javed;Demichelis, Francesca;Moeller, Peter;Bismar, Tarek A;Kuefer, Rainer;Fullen, Douglas R;Johnson, Timothy M;Greenson, Joel K;Giordano, Thomas J;Tan, Patrick;Tomlins, Scott A;Varambally, Sooryanarayana;Rubin, Mark A;Maher, Christopher A;Chinnaiyan, Arul M"
20512124,2010,Nature medicine,An autoimmune-mediated strategy for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination.,"Although vaccination is most effective when used to prevent disease, cancer vaccine development has focused predominantly on providing therapy against established growing tumors. The difficulty in developing prophylactic cancer vaccines is primarily due to the fact that tumor antigens are variations of self proteins and would probably mediate profound autoimmune complications if used in a preventive vaccine setting. Here we use several mouse breast cancer models to define a prototypic strategy for prophylactic cancer vaccination. We selected alpha-lactalbumin as our target vaccine autoantigen because it is a breast-specific differentiation protein expressed in high amounts in the majority of human breast carcinomas and in mammary epithelial cells only during lactation. We found that immunoreactivity against alpha-lactalbumin provides substantial protection and therapy against growth of autochthonous tumors in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer and against 4T1 transplantable breast tumors in BALB/c mice. Because alpha-lactalbumin is conditionally expressed only during lactation, vaccination-induced prophylaxis occurs without any detectable inflammation in normal nonlactating breast tissue. Thus, alpha-lactalbumin vaccination may provide safe and effective protection against the development of breast cancer for women in their post-child-bearing, premenopausal years, when lactation is readily avoidable and risk for developing breast cancer is high.","Jaini, Ritika;Kesaraju, Pavani;Johnson, Justin M;Altuntas, Cengiz Z;Jane-Wit, Daniel;Tuohy, Vincent K"
20495567,2010,Nature medicine,A genome-wide RNA interference screen reveals an essential CREB3L2-ATF5-MCL1 survival pathway in malignant glioma with therapeutic implications.,"Activating transcription factor-5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in malignant glioma and has a key role in promoting cell survival. Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein-3-like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models. Our results demonstrate that ATF5 is essential in malignant glioma genesis and reveal that the ATF5-mediated survival pathway described here provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant glioma.","Sheng, Zhi;Li, Li;Zhu, Lihua J;Smith, Thomas W;Demers, Andrea;Ross, Alonzo H;Moser, Richard P;Green, Michael R"
20473309,2010,Nature medicine,ERK activation drives intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice.,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is essential for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice, but the mechanisms by which Apc enhances tumor growth are unknown. Here we show that microflora-MyD88-ERK signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) promotes tumorigenesis by increasing the stability of the c-Myc oncoprotein. Activation of ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) phosphorylates c-Myc, preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice have lower phospho-ERK (p-ERK) levels and fewer and smaller IEC tumors than Apc(min/+) mice. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88)-independent activation of ERK by epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased p-ERK and c-Myc and restored the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) phenotype in Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice. Administration of an ERK inhibitor suppressed intestinal tumorigenesis in EGF-treated Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) and Apc(min/+) mice and increased their survival. Our data reveal a new facet of oncogene-environment interaction, in which microflora-induced TLR activation regulates oncogene expression and related IEC tumor growth in a susceptible host.","Lee, Sung Hee;Hu, Li-Li;Gonzalez-Navajas, Jose;Seo, Geom Seog;Shen, Carol;Brick, Jonathan;Herdman, Scott;Varki, Nissi;Corr, Maripat;Lee, Jongdae;Raz, Eyal"
20436485,2010,Nature medicine,Derepression of an endogenous long terminal repeat activates the CSF1R proto-oncogene in human lymphoma.,"Mammalian genomes contain many repetitive elements, including long terminal repeats (LTRs), which have long been suspected to have a role in tumorigenesis. Here we present evidence that aberrant LTR activation contributes to lineage-inappropriate gene expression in transformed human cells and that such gene expression is central for tumor cell survival. We show that B cell-derived Hodgkin's lymphoma cells depend on the activity of the non-B, myeloid-specific proto-oncogene colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). In these cells, CSF1R transcription initiates at an aberrantly activated endogenous LTR of the MaLR family (THE1B). Derepression of the THE1 subfamily of MaLR LTRs is widespread in the genome of Hodgkin's lymphoma cells and is associated with impaired epigenetic control due to loss of expression of the corepressor CBFA2T3. Furthermore, we detect LTR-driven CSF1R transcripts in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in which CSF1R is known to be expressed aberrantly. We conclude that LTR derepression is involved in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas, a finding that might have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.","Lamprecht, Björn;Walter, Korden;Kreher, Stephan;Kumar, Raman;Hummel, Michael;Lenze, Dido;Köchert, Karl;Bouhlel, Mohamed Amine;Richter, Julia;Soler, Eric;Stadhouders, Ralph;Jöhrens, Korinna;Wurster, Kathrin D;Callen, David F;Harte, Michael F;Giefing, Maciej;Barlow, Rachael;Stein, Harald;Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis;Janz, Martin;Cockerill, Peter N;Siebert, Reiner;Dörken, Bernd;Bonifer, Constanze;Mathas, Stephan"
20418886,2010,Nature medicine,PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R is crucial for leukemia stem cell potential induced by MOZ-TIF2.,"Leukemias and other cancers possess self-renewing stem cells that help to maintain the cancer. Cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy. Using an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ)-TIF2 fusion protein, we show here that AML can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells. The MOZ fusion proteins MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP interacted with the transcription factor PU.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R, also known as M-CSFR, c-FMS or CD115). Studies using PU.1-deficient mice showed that PU.1 is essential for the ability of MOZ-TIF2 to establish and maintain AML stem cells. Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(high) cells), but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(low) cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity. Using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the CSF1R promoter, we cured AML by ablation of CSF1R(high) cells. Moreover, induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemia. Thus, in this subtype of AML, leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1R(high) cell population, and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach.","Aikawa, Yukiko;Katsumoto, Takuo;Zhang, Pu;Shima, Haruko;Shino, Mika;Terui, Kiminori;Ito, Etsuro;Ohno, Hiroaki;Stanley, E Richard;Singh, Harinder;Tenen, Daniel G;Kitabayashi, Issay"

Barrett's esophagus, an otherwise benign complication of esophageal reflux, affects approximately three million Americans and precedes almost all cases of esophageal cancer. If detected as high-grade dysplasia (HGD), most esophageal cancers can be prevented. Standard-of-care screening for dysplasia uses visual endoscopy and a prescribed pattern of biopsy. This procedure, in which a tiny fraction of the affected tissue is selected for pathological examination, has a low probability of detection because dysplasia is highly focal and visually indistinguishable. We developed a system called endoscopic polarized scanning spectroscopy (EPSS), which performs rapid optical scanning and multispectral imaging of the entire esophageal surface and provides diagnoses in near real time.

Specifically, we show that loss of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) gene DAB2IP induces metastatic prostate cancer in an orthotopic mouse tumor model. Notably, DAB2IP functions as a signaling scaffold that coordinately regulates Ras and NF-kappaB through distinct domains to promote tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. DAB2IP is suppressed in human prostate cancer, where its expression inversely correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis. Moreover, we report that epigenetic silencing of DAB2IP is a key mechanism by which the polycomb-group protein histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 activates Ras and NF-kappaB and triggers metastasis. These studies define the mechanism by which two major pathways can be simultaneously activated in metastatic prostate cancer and establish EZH2 as a driver of metastasis.","Min, Junxia;Zaslavsky, Alexander;Fedele, Giuseppe;McLaughlin, Sara K;Reczek, Elizabeth E;De Raedt, Thomas;Guney, Isil;Strochlic, David E;Macconaill, Laura E;Beroukhim, Rameen;Bronson, Roderick T;Ryeom, Sandra;Hahn, William C;Loda, Massimo;Cichowski, Karen"
20098429,2010,Nature medicine,Amplification of LAPTM4B and YWHAZ contributes to chemotherapy resistance and recurrence of breast cancer.,"Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer after surgery has effectively lowered metastatic recurrence rates. However, a considerable proportion of women suffer recurrent cancer at distant metastatic sites despite adjuvant treatment. Identification of the genes crucial for tumor response to specific chemotherapy drugs is a challenge but is necessary to improve outcomes. By using integrated genomics, we identified a small number of overexpressed and amplified genes from chromosome 8q22 that were associated with early disease recurrence despite anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. We confirmed the association in an analysis of multiple independent cohorts. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of either of two of these genes, the antiapoptotic gene YWHAZ and a lysosomal gene LAPTM4B, sensitized tumor cells to anthracyclines, and overexpression of either of the genes induced anthracycline resistance. Overexpression of LAPTM4B resulted in sequestration of the anthracycline doxorubicin, delaying its appearance in the nucleus. Overexpression of these two genes was associated with poor tumor response to anthracycline treatment in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in women with primary breast cancer. Our results suggest that 8q22 amplification and overexpression of LAPTM4B and YWHAZ contribute to de novo chemoresistance to anthracyclines and are permissive for metastatic recurrence. Overexpression of these two genes may predict anthracycline resistance and influence selection of chemotherapy.","Li, Yang;Zou, Lihua;Li, Qiyuan;Haibe-Kains, Benjamin;Tian, Ruiyang;Li, Yan;Desmedt, Christine;Sotiriou, Christos;Szallasi, Zoltan;Iglehart, J Dirk;Richardson, Andrea L;Wang, Zhigang Charles"
20081861,2010,Nature medicine,Neutrophil elastase-mediated degradation of IRS-1 accelerates lung tumor growth.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent data suggest that tumor-associated inflammatory cells may modify lung tumor growth and invasiveness. To determine the role of neutrophil elastase (encoded by Elane) on tumor progression, we used the loxP-Stop-loxP K-ras(G12D) (LSL-K-ras) model of mouse lung adenocarcinoma to generate LSL-K-ras-Elane(-/-) mice. Tumor burden was markedly reduced in LSL-K-ras-Elane(-/-) mice at all time points after induction of mutant K-ras expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that whereas all LSL-K-ras-Elane(+/+) mice died, none of the mice lacking neutrophil elastase died. Neutrophil elastase directly induced tumor cell proliferation in both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas by gaining access to an endosomal compartment within tumor cells, where it degraded insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Immunoprecipitation studies showed that, as neutrophil elastase degraded IRS-1, there was increased interaction between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the potent mitogen platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), thereby skewing the PI3K axis toward tumor cell proliferation. The inverse relationship identified between neutrophil elastase and IRS-1 in LSL-K-ras mice was also identified in human lung adenocarcinomas, thus translating these findings to human disease. This study identifies IRS-1 as a key regulator of PI3K within malignant cells. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first description of a secreted proteinase gaining access to the inside of a cell and altering intracellular signaling.","Houghton, A McGarry;Rzymkiewicz, Danuta M;Ji, Hongbin;Gregory, Alyssa D;Egea, Eduardo E;Metz, Heather E;Stolz, Donna B;Land, Stephanie R;Marconcini, Luiz A;Kliment, Corrine R;Jenkins, Kimberly M;Beaulieu, Keith A;Mouded, Majd;Frank, Stuart J;Wong, Kwok K;Shapiro, Steven D"
20072130,2010,Nature medicine,Effective and selective targeting of leukemia cells using a TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor.,"Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph(+) transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy.","Janes, Matthew R;Limon, Jose J;So, Lomon;Chen, Jing;Lim, Raymond J;Chavez, Melissa A;Vu, Collin;Lilly, Michael B;Mallya, Sharmila;Ong, S Tiong;Konopleva, Marina;Martin, Michael B;Ren, Pingda;Liu, Yi;Rommel, Christian;Fruman, David A"
20037595,2010,Nature medicine,Tumor-mediated liver X receptor-alpha activation inhibits CC chemokine receptor-7 expression on dendritic cells and dampens antitumor responses.,"Sterol metabolism has recently been linked to innate and adaptive immune responses through liver X receptor (LXR) signaling. Whether products of sterol metabolism interfere with antitumor responses is currently unknown. Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate immune responses, including antitumor activity after their CC chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7)-dependent migration to lymphoid organs. Here we report that human and mouse tumors produce LXR ligands that inhibit CCR7 expression on maturing DCs and, therefore, their migration to lymphoid organs. In agreement with this observation, we detected CD83(+)CCR7(-) DCs within human tumors. Mice injected with tumors expressing the LXR ligand-inactivating enzyme sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) successfully controlled tumor growth by regaining DC migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes and by developing overt inflammation within tumors. The control of tumor growth was also observed in chimeric mice transplanted with bone marrow from mice lacking the gene encoding LXR-alpha (Nr1h3(-/-) mice) Thus, we show a new mechanism of tumor immunoescape involving products of cholesterol metabolism. The manipulation of this pathway could restore antitumor immunity in individuals with cancer.","Villablanca, Eduardo J;Raccosta, Laura;Zhou, Dan;Fontana, Raffaella;Maggioni, Daniela;Negro, Aurora;Sanvito, Francesca;Ponzoni, Maurilio;Valentinis, Barbara;Bregni, Marco;Prinetti, Alessandro;Steffensen, Knut R;Sonnino, Sandro;Gustafsson, Jan-Ake;Doglioni, Claudio;Bordignon, Claudio;Traversari, Catia;Russo, Vincenzo"
20023634,2010,Nature medicine,Real-time imaging reveals the single steps of brain metastasis formation.,"Brain metastasis frequently occurs in individuals with cancer and is often fatal. We used multiphoton laser scanning microscopy to image the single steps of metastasis formation in real time. Thus, it was possible to track the fate of individual metastasizing cancer cells in vivo in relation to blood vessels deep in the mouse brain over minutes to months. The essential steps in this model were arrest at vascular branch points, early extravasation, persistent close contacts to microvessels and perivascular growth by vessel cooption (melanoma) or early angiogenesis (lung cancer). Inefficient steps differed between the tumor types. Long-term dormancy was only observed for single perivascular cancer cells, some of which moved continuously. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibition induced long-term dormancy of lung cancer micrometastases by preventing angiogenic growth to macrometastases. The ability to image the establishment of brain metastases in vivo provides new insights into their evolution and response to therapies.","Kienast, Yvonne;von Baumgarten, Louisa;Fuhrmann, Martin;Klinkert, Wolfgang E F;Goldbrunner, Roland;Herms, Jochen;Winkler, Frank"
19966776,2009,Nature medicine,A purine scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor destabilizes BCL-6 and has specific antitumor activity in BCL-6-dependent B cell lymphomas.,"We report that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors selectively kill diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) that depend on the BCL-6 transcriptional repressor. We found that endogenous Hsp90 interacts with BCL-6 in DLBCL cells and can stabilize BCL-6 mRNA and protein. Hsp90 formed a complex with BCL-6 at its target promoters, and Hsp90 inhibitors derepressed BCL-6 target genes. A stable mutant of BCL-6 rescued DLBCL cells from Hsp90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. BCL-6 and Hsp90 were almost invariantly coexpressed in the nuclei of primary DLBCL cells, suggesting that their interaction is relevant in this disease. We examined the pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy of PU-H71, a recently developed purine-derived Hsp90 inhibitor. PU-H71 preferentially accumulated in lymphomas compared to normal tissues and selectively suppressed BCL-6-dependent DLBCLs in vivo, inducing reactivation of key BCL-6 target genes and apoptosis. PU-H71 also induced cell death in primary human DLBCL specimens.","Cerchietti, Leandro C;Lopes, Eloisi C;Yang, Shao Ning;Hatzi, Katerina;Bunting, Karen L;Tsikitas, Lucas A;Mallik, Alka;Robles, Ana I;Walling, Jennifer;Varticovski, Lyuba;Shaknovich, Rita;Bhalla, Kapil N;Chiosis, Gabriela;Melnick, Ari"

The requisite high numerical aperture and exogenous contrast agents that enable multiphoton microscopy, however, limit the ability to investigate substantial tissue volumes or to probe dynamic changes repeatedly over prolonged periods. Here we introduce optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) as an intravital microscopy that circumvents the technical limitations of multiphoton microscopy and, as a result, provides unprecedented access to previously unexplored, crucial aspects of tissue biology.

19701205,2009,Nature medicine,Primary cilia can both mediate and suppress Hedgehog pathway-dependent tumorigenesis.,"Primary cilia are present on most mammalian cells and are implicated in transducing Hedgehog (Hh) signals during development; however, the prevalence of cilia on human tumors remains unclear, and the role of cilia in cancer has not been examined. Here we show that human basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are frequently ciliated, and we test the role of cilia in BCC by conditionally deleting Kif3a (encoding kinesin family member 3A) or Ift88 (encoding intraflagellar transport protein 88), genes required for ciliogenesis, in two Hh pathway-dependent mouse tumor models. Ciliary ablation strongly inhibited BCC-like tumors induced by an activated form of Smoothened. In contrast, removal of cilia accelerated tumors induced by activated Gli2, a transcriptional effector of Hh signaling. These seemingly paradoxical effects are consistent with a dual role for cilia in mediating both the activation and the repression of the Hh signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that cilia function as unique signaling organelles that can either mediate or suppress tumorigenesis depending on the nature of the oncogenic initiating event.","Wong, Sunny Y;Seol, Allen D;So, Po-Lin;Ermilov, Alexandre N;Bichakjian, Christopher K;Epstein, Ervin H;Dlugosz, Andrzej A;Reiter, Jeremy F"
19701203,2009,Nature medicine,Dual and opposing roles of primary cilia in medulloblastoma development.,"Recent work has shown that primary cilia are essential for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during mammalian development. It is also known that aberrant Hh signaling can lead to cancer, but the role of primary cilia in oncogenesis is not known. Cerebellar granule neuron precursors (GNPs) can give rise to medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. The primary cilium and Hh signaling are required for GNP proliferation. We asked whether primary cilia in GNPs have a role in medulloblastoma growth in mice. Genetic ablation of primary cilia blocked medulloblastoma formation when this tumor was driven by a constitutively active Smoothened protein (Smo), an upstream activator of Hh signaling. In contrast, removal of cilia was required for medulloblastoma growth by a constitutively active glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-2 (GLI2), a downstream transcription factor. Thus, primary cilia are either required for or inhibit medulloblastoma formation, depending on the initiating oncogenic event. Remarkably, the presence or absence of cilia was associated with specific variants of human medulloblastomas; primary cilia were found in medulloblastomas with activation in HH or WNT signaling but not in most medulloblastomas in other distinct molecular subgroups. Primary cilia could serve as a diagnostic tool and provide new insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis.","Han, Young-Goo;Kim, Hong Joo;Dlugosz, Andrzej A;Ellison, David W;Gilbertson, Richard J;Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo"
19701202,2009,Nature medicine,A human colonic commensal promotes colon tumorigenesis via activation of T helper type 17 T cell responses.,"The intestinal flora may promote colon tumor formation. Here we explore immunologic mechanisms of colonic carcinogenesis by a human colonic bacterium, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). ETBF that secretes B. fragilis toxin (BFT) causes human inflammatory diarrhea but also asymptomatically colonizes a proportion of the human population. Our results indicate that whereas both ETBF and nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) chronically colonize mice, only ETBF triggers colitis and strongly induces colonic tumors in multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice. ETBF induces robust, selective colonic signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) activation with colitis characterized by a selective T helper type 17 (T(H)17) response distributed between CD4+ T cell receptor-alphabeta (TCRalphabeta)+ and CD4-8-TCRgammadelta+ T cells. Antibody-mediated blockade of interleukin-17 (IL-17) as well as the receptor for IL-23, a key cytokine amplifying T(H)17 responses, inhibits ETBF-induced colitis, colonic hyperplasia and tumor formation. These results show a Stat3- and T(H)17-dependent pathway for inflammation-induced cancer by a common human commensal bacterium, providing new mechanistic insight into human colon carcinogenesis.","Wu, Shaoguang;Rhee, Ki-Jong;Albesiano, Emilia;Rabizadeh, Shervin;Wu, Xinqun;Yen, Hung-Rong;Huso, David L;Brancati, Frederick L;Wick, Elizabeth;McAllister, Florencia;Housseau, Franck;Pardoll, Drew M;Sears, Cynthia L"

To explore early cellular changes that occur in BRCA1 mutation carriers, we have prospectively isolated distinct epithelial subpopulations from normal mammary tissue and preneoplastic specimens from individuals heterozygous for a BRCA1 mutation. We describe three epithelial subsets including basal stem/progenitor, luminal progenitor and mature luminal cells. Unexpectedly, we found that breast tissue from BRCA1 mutation carriers harbors an expanded luminal progenitor population that shows factor-independent growth in vitro. Moreover, gene expression profiling revealed that breast tissue heterozygous for a BRCA1 mutation and basal breast tumors were more similar to normal luminal progenitor cells than any other subset, including the stem cell-enriched population. The c-KIT tyrosine kinase receptor (encoded by KIT) emerged as a key marker of luminal progenitor cells and was more highly expressed in BRCA1-associated preneoplastic tissue and tumors.

We describe here the development of fluorescently labeled activity-based probes (ABPs) that covalently label active caspases in vivo. We used these probes to monitor apoptosis in the thymi of mice treated with dexamethasone as well as in tumor-bearing mice treated with the apoptosis-inducing monoclonal antibody Apomab (Genentech). Caspase ABPs provided direct readouts of the kinetics of apoptosis in live mice, whole organs and tissue extracts. The probes produced a maximum fluorescent signal that could be monitored noninvasively and that coincided with the peak in caspase activity, as measured by gel analysis. Overall, these studies demonstrate that caspase-specific ABPs have the potential to be used for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis in both preclinical and clinical settings.","Edgington, Laura E;Berger, Alicia B;Blum, Galia;Albrow, Victoria E;Paulick, Margot G;Lineberry, Neil;Bogyo, Matthew"
19597504,2009,Nature medicine,Imaging transforming growth factor-beta signaling dynamics and therapeutic response in breast cancer bone metastasis.,"Although the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, its in vivo dynamics and temporal-spatial involvement in organ-specific metastasis have not been investigated. Here we engineered a xenograft model system with a conditional control of the TGF-beta-SMAD signaling pathway and a dual-luciferase reporter system for tracing both metastatic burden and TGF-beta signaling activity in vivo. Strong TGF-beta signaling in osteolytic bone lesions is suppressed directly by genetic and pharmacological disruption of the TGF-beta-SMAD pathway and indirectly by inhibition of osteoclast function with bisphosphonates. Notably, disruption of TGF-beta signaling early in metastasis can substantially reduce metastasis burden but becomes less effective when bone lesions are well established. Our in vivo system for real-time manipulation and detection of TGF-beta signaling provides a proof of principle for using similar strategies to analyze the in vivo dynamics of other metastasis-associated signaling pathways and will expedite the development and characterization of therapeutic agents.","Korpal, Manav;Yan, Jun;Lu, Xin;Xu, Shuwa;Lerit, Dorothy A;Kang, Yibin"
19584866,2009,Nature medicine,A small molecule blocking oncogenic protein EWS-FLI1 interaction with RNA helicase A inhibits growth of Ewing's sarcoma.,"Many sarcomas and leukemias carry nonrandom chromosomal translocations encoding tumor-specific mutant fusion transcription factors that are essential to their molecular pathogenesis. Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) contain a characteristic t(11;22) translocation leading to expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 is a disordered protein that precludes standard structure-based small-molecule inhibitor design. EWS-FLI1 binding to RNA helicase A (RHA) is important for its oncogenic function. We therefore used surface plasmon resonance screening to identify compounds that bind EWS-FLI1 and might block its interaction with RHA. YK-4-279, a derivative of the lead compound from the screen, blocks RHA binding to EWS-FLI1, induces apoptosis in ESFT cells and reduces the growth of ESFT orthotopic xenografts. These findings provide proof of principle that inhibiting the interaction of mutant cancer-specific transcription factors with the normal cellular binding partners required for their oncogenic activity provides a promising strategy for the development of uniquely effective, tumor-specific anticancer agents.","Erkizan, Hayriye V;Kong, Yali;Merchant, Melinda;Schlottmann, Silke;Barber-Rotenberg, Julie S;Yuan, Linshan;Abaan, Ogan D;Chou, Tsu-Hang;Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan;Brown, Milton L;Uren, Aykut;Toretsky, Jeffrey A"
19525966,2009,Nature medicine,Hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors mediate tumor-nerve interactions and bone cancer pain.,"Pain is one of the most severe and debilitating symptoms associated with several forms of cancer. Various types of carcinomas and sarcomas metastasize to skeletal bones and cause spontaneous bone pain and hyperalgesia, which is accompanied by bone degradation and remodeling of peripheral nerves. Despite recent advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of cancer-evoked pain are not well understood. Several types of non-hematopoietic tumors secrete hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors that act on myeloid cells and tumor cells. Here we report that receptors and signaling mediators of granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) are also functionally expressed on sensory nerves. GM-CSF sensitized nerves to mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP release and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. Interruption of G-CSF and GM-CSF signaling in vivo led to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer pain. The key significance of GM-CSF signaling in sensory neurons was revealed by an attenuation of tumor-evoked pain following a sensory nerve-specific knockdown of GM-CSF receptors. These results show that G-CSF and GM-CSF are important in tumor-nerve interactions and suggest that their receptors on primary afferent nerve fibers constitute potential therapeutic targets in cancer pain.","Schweizerhof, Matthias;Stösser, Sebastian;Kurejova, Martina;Njoo, Christian;Gangadharan, Vijayan;Agarwal, Nitin;Schmelz, Martin;Bali, Kiran Kumar;Michalski, Christoph W;Brugger, Stefan;Dickenson, Anthony;Simone, Donald A;Kuner, Rohini"
19396174,2009,Nature medicine,Adjuvant IL-7 antagonizes multiple cellular and molecular inhibitory networks to enhance immunotherapies.,"Identifying key factors that enhance immune responses is crucial for manipulating immunity to tumors. We show that after a vaccine-induced immune response, adjuvant interleukin-7 (IL-7) improves antitumor responses and survival in an animal model. The improved immune response is associated with increased IL-6 production and augmented T helper type 17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, IL-7 modulates the expression of two ubiquitin ligases: Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cbl-b), a negative regulator of T cell activation, is repressed, and SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase-2 (Smurf2) is enhanced, which antagonizes transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Notably, we show that although short term IL-7 therapy potently enhances vaccine-mediated immunity, in the absence of vaccination it is inefficient in promoting antitumor immune responses, despite inducing homeostatic proliferation of T cells. The ability of adjuvant IL-7 to antagonize inhibitory networks at the cellular and molecular level has major implications for immunotherapy in the treatment of tumors.","Pellegrini, Marc;Calzascia, Thomas;Elford, Alisha R;Shahinian, Arda;Lin, Amy E;Dissanayake, Dilan;Dhanji, Salim;Nguyen, Linh T;Gronski, Matthew A;Morre, Michel;Assouline, Brigitte;Lahl, Katharina;Sparwasser, Tim;Ohashi, Pamela S;Mak, Tak W"

19363497,2009,Nature medicine,Copy number analysis indicates monoclonal origin of lethal metastatic prostate cancer.,"Many studies have shown that primary prostate cancers are multifocal and are composed of multiple genetically distinct cancer cell clones. Whether or not multiclonal primary prostate cancers typically give rise to multiclonal or monoclonal prostate cancer metastases is largely unknown, although studies at single chromosomal loci are consistent with the latter case. Here we show through a high-resolution genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number survey that most, if not all, metastatic prostate cancers have monoclonal origins and maintain a unique signature copy number pattern of the parent cancer cell while also accumulating a variable number of separate subclonally sustained changes. We find no relationship between anatomic site of metastasis and genomic copy number change pattern. Taken together with past animal and cytogenetic studies of metastasis and recent single-locus genetic data in prostate and other metastatic cancers, these data indicate that despite common genomic heterogeneity in primary cancers, most metastatic cancers arise from a single precursor cancer cell.

19151727,2009,Nature medicine,Regulation of cardiovascular development and integrity by the heart of glass-cerebral cavernous malformation protein pathway.,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are human vascular malformations caused by mutations in three genes of unknown function: KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10. Here we show that the heart of glass (HEG1) receptor, which in zebrafish has been linked to ccm gene function, is selectively expressed in endothelial cells. Heg1(-/-) mice showed defective integrity of the heart, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Heg1(-/-); Ccm2(lacZ/+) and Ccm2(lacZ/lacZ) mice had more severe cardiovascular defects and died early in development owing to a failure of nascent endothelial cells to associate into patent vessels. This endothelial cell phenotype was shared by zebrafish embryos deficient in heg, krit1 or ccm2 and reproduced in CCM2-deficient human endothelial cells in vitro. Defects in the hearts of zebrafish lacking heg or ccm2, in the aortas of early mouse embryos lacking CCM2 and in the lymphatic vessels of neonatal mice lacking HEG1 were associated with abnormal endothelial cell junctions like those observed in human CCMs. Biochemical and cellular imaging analyses identified a cell-autonomous pathway in which the HEG1 receptor couples to KRIT1 at these cell junctions.

Cell type- or region-specific expression of activated forms of the oncoproteins Harvey-Ras and AKT in fewer than 60 glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in the hippocampus, subventricular zone or cortex of mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the tumor suppressor Tp53 were tested. Mice developed glioblastoma multiforme when transduced either in the subventricular zone or the hippocampus. However, tumors were rarely detected when the mice were transduced in the cortex. Transplantation of brain tumor cells into naive recipient mouse brain resulted in the formation of glioblastoma multiforme-like tumors, which contained CD133(+) cells, formed tumorspheres and could differentiate into neurons and astrocytes. We suggest that the use of Cre-loxP-controlled lentiviral vectors is a novel way to generate a mouse glioblastoma multiforme model in a region- and cell type-specific manner in adult mice.","Marumoto, Tomotoshi;Tashiro, Ayumu;Friedmann-Morvinski, Dinorah;Scadeng, Miriam;Soda, Yasushi;Gage, Fred H;Verma, Inder M"
19122658,2009,Nature medicine,A stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"To better understand the relationship between tumor-host interactions and the efficacy of chemotherapy, we have developed an analytical approach to quantify several biological processes observed in gene expression data sets. We tested the approach on tumor biopsies from individuals with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. We report that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) in subjects in the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 trial. The predictive value of the stromal signature was successfully validated in two independent cohorts of subjects who received chemotherapy but not in an untreated control group, indicating that the signature is predictive rather than prognostic. The genes in the signature are expressed in reactive stroma, according to reanalysis of data from microdissected breast tumor samples. These findings identify a previously undescribed resistance mechanism to FEC treatment and suggest that antistromal agents may offer new ways to overcome resistance to chemotherapy.","Farmer, Pierre;Bonnefoi, Hervé;Anderle, Pascale;Cameron, David;Wirapati, Pratyaksha;Wirapati, Pratyakasha;Becette, Véronique;André, Sylvie;Piccart, Martine;Campone, Mario;Brain, Etienne;Macgrogan, Gaëtan;Petit, Thierry;Jassem, Jacek;Bibeau, Frédéric;Blot, Emmanuel;Bogaerts, Jan;Aguet, Michel;Bergh, Jonas;Iggo, Richard;Delorenzi, Mauro"

MACC1 expression in tumor specimens is an independent prognostic indicator of metastasis formation and metastasis-free survival. We show that the gene encoding the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, MET, is a transcriptional target of MACC1. MACC1 promotes proliferation, invasion and HGF-induced scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture and tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. These phenotypes are lost in cells expressing MACC1 mutants lacking the SH3 domain or the proline-rich motif. For clinical practice, MACC1 will be useful for the identification of poor prognosis subjects with colorectal cancer and is a promising new target for intervention in metastasis formation.","Stein, Ulrike;Walther, Wolfgang;Arlt, Franziska;Schwabe, Holger;Smith, Janice;Fichtner, Iduna;Birchmeier, Walter;Schlag, Peter M"
19098907,2009,Nature medicine,Gamma-secretase inhibitors reverse glucocorticoid resistance in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) block the activation of the oncogenic protein Notch homolog-1 (NOTCH1) in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, limited antileukemic cytotoxicity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity have restricted the clinical application of these targeted drugs. Here we show that combination therapy with GSIs plus glucocorticoids can improve the antileukemic effects of GSIs and reduce their gut toxicity in vivo. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL restored glucocorticoid receptor autoupregulation and induced apoptotic cell death through induction of the gene encoding BCL-2-like apoptosis initiator-11 (BCL2L11). GSI treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and accumulation of goblet cells in the gut mediated by upregulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor-4 (Klf4), a negative regulator of the cell cycle required for goblet cell differentiation. In contrast, glucocorticoid treatment induced transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) and protected mice from developing the intestinal goblet cell metaplasia typically induced by inhibition of NOTCH signaling with GSIs. These results support a role for glucocorticoids plus GSIs in the treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL.","Real, Pedro J;Tosello, Valeria;Palomero, Teresa;Castillo, Mireia;Hernando, Eva;de Stanchina, Elisa;Sulis, Maria Luisa;Barnes, Kelly;Sawai, Catherine;Homminga, Irene;Meijerink, Jules;Aifantis, Iannis;Basso, Giuseppe;Cordon-Cardo, Carlos;Ai, Walden;Ferrando, Adolfo"
19029981,2008,Nature medicine,Effective use of PI3K and MEK inhibitors to treat mutant Kras G12D and PIK3CA H1047R murine lung cancers.,"Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA). They are most frequently observed in two hotspots: the helical domain (E545K and E542K) and the kinase domain (H1047R). Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. In this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R. Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. In contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. However, when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, ARRY-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers. These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and, when combined with MEK inhibitors, may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers.","Engelman, Jeffrey A;Chen, Liang;Tan, Xiaohong;Crosby, Katherine;Guimaraes, Alexander R;Upadhyay, Rabi;Maira, Michel;McNamara, Kate;Perera, Samanthi A;Song, Youngchul;Chirieac, Lucian R;Kaur, Ramneet;Lightbown, Angela;Simendinger, Jessica;Li, Timothy;Padera, Robert F;García-Echeverría, Carlos;Weissleder, Ralph;Mahmood, Umar;Cantley, Lewis C;Wong, Kwok-Kin"
19029980,2008,Nature medicine,Eradication of acute promyelocytic leukemia-initiating cells through PML-RARA degradation.,"Retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide target the protein stability and transcriptional repression activity of the fusion oncoprotein PML-RARA, resulting in regression of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Phenotypically, retinoic acid induces differentiation of APL cells. Here we show that retinoic acid also triggers growth arrest of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) ex vivo and their clearance in PML-RARA mouse APL in vivo. Retinoic acid treatment of mouse APLs expressing the fusion protein PLZF-RARA triggers full differentiation, but not LIC loss or disease remission, establishing that differentiation and LIC loss can be uncoupled. Although retinoic acid and arsenic synergize to clear LICs through cooperative PML-RARA degradation, this combination does not enhance differentiation. A cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation site in PML-RARA is crucial for retinoic acid-induced PML-RARA degradation and LIC clearance. Moreover, activation of cAMP signaling enhances LIC loss by retinoic acid, identifying cAMP as another potential APL therapy. Thus, whereas transcriptional activation of PML-RARA is likely to control differentiation, its catabolism triggers LIC eradication and long-term remission of mouse APL. Therapy-triggered degradation of oncoproteins could be a general strategy to eradicate cancer stem cells.","Nasr, Rihab;Guillemin, Marie-Claude;Ferhi, Omar;Soilihi, Hassan;Peres, Laurent;Berthier, Caroline;Rousselot, Philippe;Robledo-Sarmiento, Macarena;Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valérie;Gourmel, Bernard;Vitoux, Dominique;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo;Rochette-Egly, Cécile;Zhu, Jun;de Thé, Hugues"

To achieve this goal, minimizing the background signal originating from nontarget tissues is crucial. Here we achieve highly specific in vivo cancer visualization by using a newly designed targeted 'activatable' fluorescent imaging probe. This agent is activated after cellular internalization by sensing the pH change in the lysosome. Novel acidic pH-activatable probes based on the boron-dipyrromethene fluorophore were synthesized and then conjugated to a cancer-targeting monoclonal antibody. As proof of concept, ex vivo and in vivo imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-positive lung cancer cells in mice was performed. The probe was highly specific for tumors with minimal background signal. Furthermore, because the acidic pH in lysosomes is maintained by the energy-consuming proton pump, only viable cancer cells were successfully visualized. The design concept can be widely adapted to cancer-specific, cell surface-targeting molecules that result in cellular internalization.","Urano, Yasuteru;Asanuma, Daisuke;Hama, Yukihiro;Koyama, Yoshinori;Barrett, Tristan;Kamiya, Mako;Nagano, Tetsuo;Watanabe, Toshiaki;Hasegawa, Akira;Choyke, Peter L;Kobayashi, Hisataka"
18978797,2008,Nature medicine,Virus-specific T cells engineered to coexpress tumor-specific receptors: persistence and antitumor activity in individuals with neuroblastoma.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed to nonviral tumor-associated antigens do not survive long term and have limited antitumor activity in vivo, in part because such tumor cells typically lack the appropriate costimulatory molecules. We therefore engineered Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CTLs to express a chimeric antigen receptor directed to the diasialoganglioside GD2, a nonviral tumor-associated antigen expressed by human neuroblastoma cells. We reasoned that these genetically engineered lymphocytes would receive optimal costimulation after engagement of their native receptors, enhancing survival and antitumor activity mediated through their chimeric receptors. Here we show in individuals with neuroblastoma that EBV-specific CTLs expressing a chimeric GD2-specific receptor indeed survive longer than T cells activated by the CD3-specific antibody OKT3 and expressing the same chimeric receptor but lacking virus specificity. Infusion of these genetically modified cells seemed safe and was associated with tumor regression or necrosis in half of the subjects tested. Hence, virus-specific CTLs can be modified to function as tumor-directed effector cells.","Pule, Martin A;Savoldo, Barbara;Myers, G Doug;Rossig, Claudia;Russell, Heidi V;Dotti, Gianpietro;Huls, M Helen;Liu, Enli;Gee, Adrian P;Mei, Zhuyong;Yvon, Eric;Weiss, Heidi L;Liu, Hao;Rooney, Cliona M;Heslop, Helen E;Brenner, Malcolm K"

Recognition of 5'-triphosphate by the cytosolic antiviral helicase retinoic acid-induced protein I (Rig-I, encoded by Ddx58) activated innate immune cells such as dendritic cells and directly induced expression of interferons (IFNs) and apoptosis in tumor cells. These Rig-I-mediated activities synergized with siRNA-mediated Bcl2 silencing to provoke massive apoptosis of tumor cells in lung metastases in vivo. The therapeutic activity required natural killer cells and IFN, as well as silencing of Bcl2, as evidenced by rescue with a mutated Bcl2 target, by site-specific cleavage of Bcl2 messenger RNA in lung metastases and downregulation of Bcl-2 protein in tumor cells in vivo. Together, 3p-siRNA represents a single molecule-based approach in which Rig-I activation on both the immune- and tumor cell level corrects immune ignorance and in which gene silencing corrects key molecular events that govern tumor cell survival.","Poeck, Hendrik;Besch, Robert;Maihoefer, Cornelius;Renn, Marcel;Tormo, Damia;Morskaya, Svetlana Shulga;Kirschnek, Susanne;Gaffal, Evelyn;Landsberg, Jennifer;Hellmuth, Johannes;Schmidt, Andreas;Anz, David;Bscheider, Michael;Schwerd, Tobias;Berking, Carola;Bourquin, Carole;Kalinke, Ulrich;Kremmer, Elisabeth;Kato, Hiroki;Akira, Shizuo;Meyers, Rachel;Häcker, Georg;Neuenhahn, Michael;Busch, Dirk;Ruland, Jürgen;Rothenfusser, Simon;Prinz, Marco;Hornung, Veit;Endres, Stefan;Tüting, Thomas;Hartmann, Gunther"
18931684,2008,Nature medicine,Suppressed NFAT-dependent VEGFR1 expression and constitutive VEGFR2 signaling in infantile hemangioma.,"Infantile hemangiomas are localized and rapidly growing regions of disorganized angiogenesis. We show that expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1) in hemangioma endothelial cells (hemECs) and hemangioma tissue is markedly reduced compared to controls. Low VEGFR1 expression in hemECs results in VEGF-dependent activation of VEGFR2 and downstream signaling pathways. In hemECs, transcription of the gene encoding VEGFR1 (FLT1) is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Low VEGFR1 expression in hemECs is caused by reduced activity of a pathway involving beta1 integrin, the integrin-like receptor tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM8), VEGFR2 and NFAT. In a subset of individuals with hemangioma, we found missense mutations in the genes encoding VEGFR2 (KDR) and TEM8 (ANTXR1). These mutations result in increased interactions among VEGFR2, TEM8 and beta1 integrin proteins and in inhibition of integrin activity. Normalization of the constitutive VEGFR2 signaling in hemECs with soluble VEGFR1 or antibodies that neutralize VEGF or stimulate beta1 integrin suggests that local administration of these or similar agents may be effective in hemangioma treatment.","Jinnin, Masatoshi;Medici, Damian;Park, Lucy;Limaye, Nisha;Liu, Yanqiu;Boscolo, Elisa;Bischoff, Joyce;Vikkula, Miikka;Boye, Eileen;Olsen, Bjorn R"
18931683,2008,Nature medicine,The miR-15a-miR-16-1 cluster controls prostate cancer by targeting multiple oncogenic activities.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that repress protein translation by targeting specific messenger RNAs. miR-15a and miR-16-1 act as putative tumor suppressors by targeting the oncogene BCL2. These miRNAs form a cluster at the chromosomal region 13q14, which is frequently deleted in cancer. Here, we report that the miR-15a and miR-16-1 cluster targets CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1) and WNT3A, which promotes several tumorigenic features such as survival, proliferation and invasion. In cancer cells of advanced prostate tumors, the miR-15a and miR-16 level is significantly decreased, whereas the expression of BCL2, CCND1 and WNT3A is inversely upregulated. Delivery of antagomirs specific for miR-15a and miR-16 to normal mouse prostate results in marked hyperplasia, and knockdown of miR-15a and miR-16 promotes survival, proliferation and invasiveness of untransformed prostate cells, which become tumorigenic in immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Conversely, reconstitution of miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression results in growth arrest, apoptosis and marked regression of prostate tumor xenografts. Altogether, we propose that miR-15a and miR-16 act as tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer through the control of cell survival, proliferation and invasion. These findings have therapeutic implications and may be exploited for future treatment of prostate cancer.","Bonci, Désirée;Coppola, Valeria;Musumeci, Maria;Addario, Antonio;Giuffrida, Raffaella;Memeo, Lorenzo;D'Urso, Leonardo;Pagliuca, Alfredo;Biffoni, Mauro;Labbaye, Catherine;Bartucci, Monica;Muto, Giovanni;Peschle, Cesare;De Maria, Ruggero"
18836461,2008,Nature medicine,Chemical control of protein stability and function in living mice.,"Conditional control of protein function in vivo offers great potential for deconvoluting the roles of individual proteins in complicated systems. We recently developed a method in which a small protein domain, termed a destabilizing domain, confers instability to fusion protein partners in cultured cells. Instability is reversed when a cell-permeable small molecule binds this domain. Here we describe the use of this system to regulate protein function in living mammals. We show regulation of secreted proteins and their biological activity with conditional secretion of an immunomodulatory cytokine, resulting in tumor burden reduction in mouse models. Additionally, we use this approach to control the function of a specific protein after systemic delivery of the gene that encodes it to a tumor, suggesting uses for enhancing the specificity and efficacy of targeted gene-based therapies. This method represents a new strategy to regulate protein function in living organisms with a high level of control.","Banaszynski, Laura A;Sellmyer, Mark A;Contag, Christopher H;Wandless, Thomas J;Thorne, Steve H"

Here we extend those results to targeting of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical [(131)I]FIAU to slow or stop tumor growth or to achieve tumor regression. These outcomes were achieved in xenografts with tumors that constitutively expressed the EBV-TK. With naturally infected EBV tumor cell lines (Burkitt's lymphoma and gastric carcinoma), activation of viral gene expression by pretreatment with bortezomib was required. Marked changes in tumor growth could also be achieved in naturally infected Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus tumors after pretreatment with bortezomib.

18724378,2008,Nature medicine,RPN2 gene confers docetaxel resistance in breast cancer.,"Drug resistance acquired by cancer cells has led to treatment failure. To understand the regulatory network underlying docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cells and to identify molecular targets for therapy, we tested small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against 36 genes whose expression was elevated in human nonresponders to docetaxel for the ability to promote apoptosis of docetaxel-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF7-ADR cells). The results indicate that the downregulation of the gene encoding ribophorin [corrected] II (RPN2), which is part of an N-oligosaccharyl transferase complex, most efficiently induces apoptosis of MCF7-ADR cells in the presence of docetaxel. RPN2 silencing induced reduced glycosylation of the P-glycoprotein, as well as decreased membrane localization, thereby sensitizing MCF7-ADR cells to docetaxel. Moreover, in vivo delivery of siRNA specific for RPN2 markedly reduced tumor growth in two types of models for drug resistance. Thus, RPN2 silencing makes cancer cells hypersensitive response to docetaxel, and RPN2 might be a new target for RNA interference-based therapeutics against drug resistance.","Honma, Kimi;Iwao-Koizumi, Kyoko;Takeshita, Fumitaka;Yamamoto, Yusuke;Yoshida, Teruhiko;Nishio, Kazuto;Nagahara, Shunji;Kato, Kikuya;Ochiya, Takahiro"
18670422,2008,Nature medicine,Circulating mutant DNA to assess tumor dynamics.,"The measurement of circulating nucleic acids has transformed the management of chronic viral infections such as HIV. The development of analogous markers for individuals with cancer could similarly enhance the management of their disease. DNA containing somatic mutations is highly tumor specific and thus, in theory, can provide optimum markers. However, the number of circulating mutant gene fragments is small compared to the number of normal circulating DNA fragments, making it difficult to detect and quantify them with the sensitivity required for meaningful clinical use. In this study, we applied a highly sensitive approach to quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in 162 plasma samples from 18 subjects undergoing multimodality therapy for colorectal cancer. We found that ctDNA measurements could be used to reliably monitor tumor dynamics in subjects with cancer who were undergoing surgery or chemotherapy.

The hypotheses proposed examined whether microarray measurements of gene expression either alone or combined with basic clinical covariates (stage, age, sex) could be used to predict overall survival in lung cancer subjects.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using recombinant human adenoviral vectors to detect nodal metastases in a human prostate cancer model. This was achieved by the prostate-restricted expression of optical and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reporter genes by the viral vector coupled with the innate lymphotropic properties of adenovirus. We show that peritumoral administration of these vectors results in the direct detection of reporter gene expression in metastatic lesions within sentinel lymph nodes. Notably, this approach parallels the current lymphoscintigraphy method but enables the direct PET visualization of sentinel lymph node metastases, eliminating the need for invasive lymphadenectomy.

Sequencing-based genetic tests are now available to identify mutation carriers in an effort to reduce mortality through prevention and early diagnosis. However, lack of a suitable functional assay hinders the risk assessment of more than 1,900 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in the Breast Cancer Information Core database that do not clearly disrupt the gene product. We have established a simple, versatile and reliable assay to test for the functional significance of mutations in BRCA2 using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and bacterial artificial chromosomes and have used it to classify 17 sequence variants. The assay is based on the ability of human BRCA2 to complement the loss of endogenous Brca2 in mouse ES cells. This technique may also serve as a paradigm for functional analysis of mutations found in other genes linked to human diseases.","Kuznetsov, Sergey G;Liu, Pentao;Sharan, Shyam K"
18568033,2008,Nature medicine,Reversal of learning deficits in a Tsc2+/- mouse model of tuberous sclerosis.,"Tuberous sclerosis is a single-gene disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) gene and is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. Even individuals with tuberous sclerosis and a normal intelligence quotient (approximately 50%) are commonly affected with specific neuropsychological problems, including long-term and working memory deficits. Here we report that mice with a heterozygous, inactivating mutation in the Tsc2 gene (Tsc2(+/-) mice) show deficits in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits in Tsc2(+/-) mice emerged in the absence of neuropathology and seizures, demonstrating that other disease mechanisms are involved. We show that hyperactive hippocampal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling led to abnormal long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and consequently to deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning. These deficits included impairments in two spatial learning tasks and in contextual discrimination. Notably, we show that a brief treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in adult mice rescues not only the synaptic plasticity, but also the behavioral deficits in this animal model of tuberous sclerosis. The results presented here reveal a biological basis for some of the cognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis, and they show that treatment with mTOR antagonists ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of this disorder.","Ehninger, Dan;Han, Sangyeul;Shilyansky, Carrie;Zhou, Yu;Li, Weidong;Kwiatkowski, David J;Ramesh, Vijaya;Silva, Alcino J"

To date, however, the development of effective T cell vaccines remains elusive. This is due, in part, to the lack of clearly defined correlates of protection and the inherent difficulties that hinder full characterization of the determinants of successful T cell immunity in humans. Recent data from the disparate fields of infectious disease and tumor immunology have converged, with an emphasis on the functional attributes of individual antigen-specific T cell clonotypes, to provide a better understanding of CD8+ T cell efficacy.

Here we show that DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding portions of the cytoplasmic domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which has been translocated in different fusion proteins necessary for the growth of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), protects mice from local and systemic lymphoma growth. The protection is potent and long lasting and elicits ALK-specific interferon-gamma responses and CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. A combination of chemotherapy and vaccination significantly enhanced the survival of mice challenged with ALK+ lymphomas. These findings indicate that ALK represents an ideal tumor antigen for vaccination-based therapies of ALCL and possibly other ALK+ human tumors.","Chiarle, Roberto;Martinengo, Cinzia;Mastini, Cristina;Ambrogio, Chiara;D'Escamard, Valentina;Forni, Guido;Inghirami, Giorgio"

We used laser capture microdissection to compare gene expression profiles of tumor stroma from 53 primary breast tumors and derived signatures strongly associated with clinical outcome. We present a new stroma-derived prognostic predictor (SDPP) that stratifies disease outcome independently of standard clinical prognostic factors and published expression-based predictors. The SDPP predicts outcome in several published whole tumor-derived expression data sets, identifies poor-outcome individuals from multiple clinical subtypes, including lymph node-negative tumors, and shows increased accuracy with respect to previously published predictors, especially for HER2-positive tumors. Prognostic power increases substantially when the predictor is combined with existing outcome predictors. Genes represented in the SDPP reveal the strong prognostic capacity of differential immune responses as well as angiogenic and hypoxic responses, highlighting the importance of stromal biology in tumor progression.","Finak, Greg;Bertos, Nicholas;Pepin, Francois;Sadekova, Svetlana;Souleimanova, Margarita;Zhao, Hong;Chen, Haiying;Omeroglu, Gulbeyaz;Meterissian, Sarkis;Omeroglu, Atilla;Hallett, Michael;Park, Morag"

Khleif, who received his medical degree in Jordan, now has an even bigger mandate from the king: to build an internationally renowned institute devoted to cancer research and biotechnology. Construction on The King Hussein Institute for Cancer and Biotechnology is scheduled to begin on the outskirts of Amman this month, with an expected completion in 2010.","Khleif, Samir"
18345013,2008,Nature medicine,Detection of colonic dysplasia in vivo using a targeted heptapeptide and confocal microendoscopy.,"A combination of targeted probes and new imaging technologies provides a powerful set of tools with the potential to improve the early detection of cancer. To develop a probe for detecting colon cancer, we screened phage display peptide libraries against fresh human colonic adenomas for high-affinity ligands with preferential binding to premalignant tissue. We identified a specific heptapeptide sequence, VRPMPLQ, which we synthesized, conjugated with fluorescein and tested in patients undergoing colonoscopy. We imaged topically administered peptide using a fluorescence confocal microendoscope delivered through the instrument channel of a standard colonoscope. In vivo images were acquired at 12 frames per second with 50-microm working distance and 2.5-microm (transverse) and 20-microm (axial) resolution. The fluorescein-conjugated peptide bound more strongly to dysplastic colonocytes than to adjacent normal cells with 81% sensitivity and 82% specificity. This methodology represents a promising diagnostic imaging approach for the early detection of colorectal cancer and potentially of other epithelial malignancies.","Hsiung, Pei-Lin;Hsiung, Pei-Lei;Hardy, Jonathan;Friedland, Shai;Soetikno, Roy;Du, Christine B;Wu, Amy P;Sahbaie, Peyman;Crawford, James M;Lowe, Anson W;Contag, Christopher H;Wang, Thomas D"
18297085,2008,Nature medicine,Noninvasive assessment of cancer response to therapy.,"Rapid assessment of cancer response to a therapeutic regimen can determine efficacy early in the course of treatment. Although biopsies of cancer can be used to rapidly assess pharmacodynamic response, certain disease sites are less accessible to repeated biopsies. Here, we simultaneously assess response in all sites of disease within days of starting therapy by use of peptide ligands selected for their ability to discern responding from nonresponding cancers. When conjugated to near-infrared imaging agents, the HVGGSSV peptide differentiates between these two types of cancer. Rapid, noninvasive assessment of the pharmacodynamic response within cancer promises to accelerate drug development and minimize the duration of treatment with ineffective regimens in cancer patients.","Han, Zhaozhong;Fu, Allie;Wang, Hailun;Diaz, Roberto;Geng, Ling;Onishko, Halina;Hallahan, Dennis E"

Creation of perivascular NO gradients may be an effective strategy for normalizing abnormal vasculature.","Kashiwagi, Satoshi;Tsukada, Kosuke;Xu, Lei;Miyazaki, Junichi;Kozin, Sergey V;Tyrrell, James A;Sessa, William C;Gerweck, Leo E;Jain, Rakesh K;Fukumura, Dai"
18066076,2008,Nature medicine,"Purging metastases in lymphoid organs using a combination of antigen-nonspecific adoptive T cell therapy, oncolytic virotherapy and immunotherapy.","In many common cancers, dissemination of secondary tumors via the lymph nodes poses the most significant threat to the affected individual. Metastatic cells often reach the lymph nodes by mimicking the molecular mechanisms used by hematopoietic cells to traffic to peripheral lymphoid organs. Therefore, we exploited naive T cell trafficking in order to chaperone an oncolytic virus to lymphoid organs harboring metastatic cells. Metastatic burden was initially reduced by viral oncolysis and was then eradicated, as tumor cell killing in the lymph node and spleen generated protective antitumor immunity. Lymph node purging of tumor cells was possible even in virus-immune mice. Adoptive transfer of normal T cells loaded with oncolytic virus into individuals with cancer would be technically easy to implement both to reduce the distribution of metastases and to vaccinate the affected individual in situ against micrometastatic disease. As such, this adoptive transfer could have a great therapeutic impact, in the adjuvant setting, on many different cancer types.","Qiao, Jian;Kottke, Timothy;Willmon, Candice;Galivo, Feorillo;Wongthida, Phonphimon;Diaz, Rosa Maria;Thompson, Jill;Ryno, Pamela;Barber, Glen N;Chester, John;Selby, Peter;Harrington, Kevin;Melcher, Alan;Vile, Richard G"
18037895,2007,Nature medicine,The ubiquitin ligase gp78 promotes sarcoma metastasis by targeting KAI1 for degradation.,"Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality from cancer, but the mechanisms leading to metastasis are poorly understood. In particular, relatively little is known about metastasis in cancers of mesenchymal origins, which are known as sarcomas. Approximately ten proteins have been characterized as 'metastasis suppressors', but how these proteins function and are regulated is, in general, not well understood. Gp78 (also known as AMFR or RNF45) is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of diverse substrates. Here we report that expression of gp78 has a causal role in the metastasis of an aggressive human sarcoma and that this prometastatic activity requires the E3 activity of gp78. Further, gp78 associates with and targets the transmembrane metastasis suppressor, KAI1 (also known as CD82), for degradation. Suppression of gp78 increases KAI1 abundance and reduces the metastatic potential of tumor cells, an effect that is largely blocked by concomitant suppression of KAI1. An inverse relationship between these proteins was confirmed in a human sarcoma tissue microarray. Whereas most previous efforts have focused on genetic mechanisms for the loss of metastasis suppressor genes, our results provide new evidence for post-translational downregulation of a metastasis suppressor by its ubiquitin ligase, resulting in abrogation of its metastasis-suppressing effects.","Tsai, Yien Che;Mendoza, Arnulfo;Mariano, Jennifer M;Zhou, Ming;Kostova, Zlatka;Chen, Bo;Veenstra, Timothy;Hewitt, Stephen M;Helman, Lee J;Khanna, Chand;Weissman, Allan M"
18026115,2007,Nature medicine,"T cell-encoded CD80 and 4-1BBL induce auto- and transcostimulation, resulting in potent tumor rejection.","To reject tumors, T cells must overcome poor tumor immunogenicity and an adverse tumor microenvironment. Providing agonistic costimulatory signals to tumor-infiltrating T cells to augment T cell function remains a challenge for the implementation of safe and effective immunotherapy. We hypothesized that T cells overexpressing selected costimulatory ligands could serve as cellular vehicles mediating powerful, yet constrained, anatomically targeted costimulation. Here, we show that primary human T cells expressing CD80 and 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) vigorously respond to tumor cells lacking costimulatory ligands and provoke potent rejection of large, systemic tumors in immunodeficient mice. In addition to showing costimulation of bystander T cells (transcostimulation), we show the effect of CD80 and 4-1BBL binding to their respective receptors in the immunological synapse of isolated single cells (autocostimulation). This new strategy of endowing T cells with constitutively expressed costimulatory ligands could be extended to other ligand-receptor pairs and used to enhance any targeted adoptive transfer therapy.","Stephan, Matthias T;Ponomarev, Vladimir;Brentjens, Renier J;Chang, Alex H;Dobrenkov, Konstantin V;Heller, Glenn;Sadelain, Michel"
17982462,2007,Nature medicine,Tumor-induced anorexia and weight loss are mediated by the TGF-beta superfamily cytokine MIC-1.,"Anorexia and weight loss are part of the wasting syndrome of late-stage cancer, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer, and are thought to be cytokine mediated. Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) is produced by many cancers. Examination of sera from individuals with advanced prostate cancer showed a direct relationship between MIC-1 abundance and cancer-associated weight loss. In mice with xenografted prostate tumors, elevated MIC-1 levels were also associated with marked weight, fat and lean tissue loss that was mediated by decreased food intake and was reversed by administration of antibody to MIC-1. Additionally, normal mice given systemic MIC-1 and transgenic mice overexpressing MIC-1 showed hypophagia and reduced body weight. MIC-1 mediates its effects by central mechanisms that implicate the hypothalamic transforming growth factor-beta receptor II, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, neuropeptide Y and pro-opiomelanocortin. Thus, MIC-1 is a newly defined central regulator of appetite and a potential target for the treatment of both cancer anorexia and weight loss, as well as of obesity.","Johnen, Heiko;Lin, Shu;Kuffner, Tamara;Brown, David A;Tsai, Vicky Wang-Wei;Bauskin, Asne R;Wu, Liyun;Pankhurst, Greg;Jiang, Lele;Junankar, Simon;Hunter, Mark;Fairlie, W Douglas;Lee, Nicola J;Enriquez, Ronaldo F;Baldock, Paul A;Corey, Eva;Apple, Fred S;Murakami, Maryann M;Lin, En-Ju;Wang, Chuansong;During, Matthew J;Sainsbury, Amanda;Herzog, Herbert;Breit, Samuel N"
17965722,2007,Nature medicine,Detecting tumor response to treatment using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.,"Measurements of early tumor responses to therapy have been shown, in some cases, to predict treatment outcome. We show in lymphoma-bearing mice injected intravenously with hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate that the lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed flux of (13)C label between the carboxyl groups of pyruvate and lactate in the tumor can be measured using (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging, and that this flux is inhibited within 24 h of chemotherapy. The reduction in the measured flux after drug treatment and the induction of tumor cell death can be explained by loss of the coenzyme NAD(H) and decreases in concentrations of lactate and enzyme in the tumors. The technique could provide a new way to assess tumor responses to treatment in the clinic.","Day, Sam E;Kettunen, Mikko I;Gallagher, Ferdia A;Hu, De-En;Lerche, Mathilde;Wolber, Jan;Golman, Klaes;Ardenkjaer-Larsen, Jan Henrik;Brindle, Kevin M"
17965720,2007,Nature medicine,A critical developmental switch defines the kinetics of kidney cyst formation after loss of Pkd1.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.","Piontek, Klaus;Menezes, Luis F;Garcia-Gonzalez, Miguel A;Huso, David L;Germino, Gregory G"
17906636,2007,Nature medicine,Mast cells are required for angiogenesis and macroscopic expansion of Myc-induced pancreatic islet tumors.,"An association between inflammation and cancer has long been recognized, but the cause and effect relationship linking the two remains unclear. Myc is a pleiotropic transcription factor that is overexpressed in many human cancers and instructs many extracellular aspects of the tumor tissue phenotype, including remodeling of tumor stroma and angiogenesis. Here we show in a beta-cell tumor model that activation of Myc in vivo triggers rapid recruitment of mast cells to the tumor site-a recruitment that is absolutely required for macroscopic tumor expansion. In addition, treatment of established beta-cell tumors with a mast cell inhibitor rapidly triggers hypoxia and cell death of tumor and endothelial cells. Inhibitors of mast cell function may therefore prove therapeutically useful in restraining expansion and survival of pancreatic and other cancers.","Soucek, Laura;Lawlor, Elizabeth R;Soto, Darya;Shchors, Ksenya;Swigart, Lamorna Brown;Evan, Gerard I"
17873882,2007,Nature medicine,Mutational loss of PTEN induces resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in T-cell leukemia.,"Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas (T-ALL), making this receptor a promising target for drugs such as gamma-secretase inhibitors, which block a proteolytic cleavage required for NOTCH1 activation. However, the enthusiasm for these therapies has been tempered by tumor resistance and the paucity of information on the oncogenic programs regulated by oncogenic NOTCH1. Here we show that NOTCH1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch-induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T-ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1. Overall, these findings identify transcriptional control of PTEN and regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH1 and provide the basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies for T-ALL.","Palomero, Teresa;Sulis, Maria Luisa;Cortina, Maria;Real, Pedro J;Barnes, Kelly;Ciofani, Maria;Caparros, Esther;Buteau, Jean;Brown, Kristy;Perkins, Sherrie L;Bhagat, Govind;Agarwal, Archana M;Basso, Giuseppe;Castillo, Mireia;Nagase, Satoru;Cordon-Cardo, Carlos;Parsons, Ramon;Zúñiga-Pflücker, Juan Carlos;Dominguez, Maria;Ferrando, Adolfo A"
17704786,2007,Nature medicine,Toll-like receptor 4-dependent contribution of the immune system to anticancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.,"Conventional cancer treatments rely on radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Such treatments supposedly mediate their effects via the direct elimination of tumor cells. Here we show that the success of some protocols for anticancer therapy depends on innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses. We describe in both mice and humans a previously unrecognized pathway for the activation of tumor antigen-specific T-cell immunity that involves secretion of the high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) alarmin protein by dying tumor cells and the action of HMGB1 on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed by dendritic cells (DCs). During chemotherapy or radiotherapy, DCs require signaling through TLR4 and its adaptor MyD88 for efficient processing and cross-presentation of antigen from dying tumor cells. Patients with breast cancer who carry a TLR4 loss-of-function allele relapse more quickly after radiotherapy and chemotherapy than those carrying the normal TLR4 allele. These results delineate a clinically relevant immunoadjuvant pathway triggered by tumor cell death.","Apetoh, Lionel;Ghiringhelli, François;Tesniere, Antoine;Obeid, Michel;Ortiz, Carla;Criollo, Alfredo;Mignot, Grégoire;Maiuri, M Chiara;Ullrich, Evelyn;Saulnier, Patrick;Yang, Huan;Amigorena, Sebastian;Ryffel, Bernard;Barrat, Franck J;Saftig, Paul;Levi, Francis;Lidereau, Rosette;Nogues, Catherine;Mira, Jean-Paul;Chompret, Agnès;Joulin, Virginie;Clavel-Chapelon, Françoise;Bourhis, Jean;André, Fabrice;Delaloge, Suzette;Tursz, Thomas;Kroemer, Guido;Zitvogel, Laurence"
17694067,2007,Nature medicine,The E3 ligase HACE1 is a critical chromosome 6q21 tumor suppressor involved in multiple cancers.,"Transformation and cancer growth are regulated by the coordinate actions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Here, we show that the novel E3 ubiquitin ligase HACE1 is frequently downregulated in human tumors and maps to a region of chromosome 6q21 implicated in multiple human cancers. Genetic inactivation of HACE1 in mice results in the development of spontaneous, late-onset cancer. A second hit from either environmental triggers or genetic heterozygosity of another tumor suppressor, p53, markedly increased tumor incidence in a Hace1-deficient background. Re-expression of HACE1 in human tumor cells directly abrogates in vitro and in vivo tumor growth, whereas downregulation of HACE1 via siRNA allows non-tumorigenic human cells to form tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, the tumor-suppressor function of HACE1 is dependent on its E3 ligase activity and HACE1 controls adhesion-dependent growth and cell cycle progression during cell stress through degradation of cyclin D1. Thus, HACE1 is a candidate chromosome 6q21 tumor-suppressor gene involved in multiple cancers.","Zhang, Liyong;Anglesio, Michael S;O'Sullivan, Maureen;Zhang, Fan;Yang, Ge;Sarao, Renu;Mai, P Nghiem;Cronin, Shane;Hara, Hiromitsu;Melnyk, Nataliya;Li, Liheng;Wada, Teiji;Liu, Peter P;Farrar, Jason;Arceci, Robert J;Sorensen, Poul H;Penninger, Josef M"
17676052,2007,Nature medicine,A spatially and temporally restricted mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma.,"Soft tissue sarcomas are mesenchymal tumors that are fatal in approximately one-third of patients. To explore mechanisms of sarcoma pathogenesis, we have generated a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. Intramuscular delivery of an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase in mice with conditional mutations in Kras and Trp53 was sufficient to initiate high-grade sarcomas with myofibroblastic differentiation. Like human sarcomas, these tumors show a predilection for lung rather than lymph node metastasis. Using this model, we showed that a prototype handheld imaging device can identify residual tumor during intraoperative molecular imaging. Deletion of the Ink4a-Arf locus (Cdkn2a), but not Bak1 and Bax, could substitute for mutation of Trp53 in this model. Deletion of Bak1 and Bax, however, was able to substitute for mutation of Trp53 in the development of sinonasal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis seems sufficient to mediate p53 tumor suppression in an epithelial cancer, but not in this model of soft tissue sarcoma.","Kirsch, David G;Dinulescu, Daniela M;Miller, John B;Grimm, Jan;Santiago, Philip M;Young, Nathan P;Nielsen, G Petur;Quade, Bradley J;Chaber, Christopher J;Schultz, Christian P;Takeuchi, Osamu;Bronson, Roderick T;Crowley, Denise;Korsmeyer, Stanley J;Yoon, Sam S;Hornicek, Francis J;Weissleder, Ralph;Jacks, Tyler"

Here we demonstrate that hedgehog ligands secreted by bone-marrow, nodal and splenic stromal cells function as survival factors for malignant lymphoma and plasmacytoma cells derived from transgenic Emu-Myc mice or isolated from humans with these malignancies. Hedgehog pathway inhibition in lymphomas induced apoptosis through downregulation of Bcl2, but was independent of p53 or Bmi1 expression. Blockage of hedgehog signaling in vivo inhibited expansion of mouse lymphoma cells in a syngeneic mouse model and reduced tumor mass in mice with fully developed disease. Our data indicate that stromally induced hedgehog signaling may provide an important survival signal for B- and plasma-cell malignancies in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of this interaction by hedgehog pathway inhibition could provide a new strategy in lymphoma and multiple myeloma therapy.","Dierks, Christine;Grbic, Jovana;Zirlik, Katja;Beigi, Ronak;Englund, Nathan P;Guo, Gui-Rong;Veelken, Hendrik;Engelhardt, Monika;Mertelsmann, Roland;Kelleher, Joseph F;Schultz, Peter;Warmuth, Markus"
17603493,2007,Nature medicine,Altered recognition of antigen is a mechanism of CD8+ T cell tolerance in cancer.,"Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. Using in vivo models, we show here that MDSCs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) dimers to CD8-expressing T cells through nitration of tyrosines in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD8 complex. This process makes CD8-expressing T cells unable to bind pMHC and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. Nitration of TCR-CD8 is induced by MDSCs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. Molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of TCR-CD8 and its interaction with pMHC. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of MDSCs.","Nagaraj, Srinivas;Gupta, Kapil;Pisarev, Vladimir;Kinarsky, Leo;Sherman, Simon;Kang, Loveleen;Herber, Donna L;Schneck, Jonathan;Gabrilovich, Dmitry I"
17589521,2007,Nature medicine,"Fen1 mutations result in autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancers.","Functional deficiency of the FEN1 gene has been suggested to cause genomic instability and cancer predisposition. We have identified a group of FEN1 mutations in human cancer specimens. Most of these mutations abrogated two of three nuclease activities of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). To demonstrate the etiological significance of these somatic mutations, we inbred a mouse line harboring the E160D mutation representing mutations identified in human cancers. Selective elimination of nuclease activities led to frequent spontaneous mutations and accumulation of incompletely digested DNA fragments in apoptotic cells. The mutant mice were predisposed to autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancers. The mutator phenotype results in the initiation of cancer, whereas chronic inflammation promotes the cancer progression. The current work exemplifies the approach of studying the mechanisms of individual polymorphisms and somatic mutations in cancer development, and may serve as a reference in developing new therapeutic regimens through the suppression of inflammatory responses.","Zheng, Li;Dai, Huifang;Zhou, Mian;Li, Mei;Singh, Purnima;Qiu, Junzhuan;Tsark, Walter;Huang, Qin;Kernstine, Kemp;Zhang, Xuemei;Lin, Dongxin;Shen, Binghui"
17515897,2007,Nature medicine,Abrogation of nuclear receptors Nr4a3 and Nr4a1 leads to development of acute myeloid leukemia.,"Nur77 (NR4A1) and Nor-1 (NR4A3) are highly homologous orphan nuclear receptors that regulate the transcription of overlapping target genes. The transcriptional activity of both proteins is regulated in a ligand-independent manner by cell- and stimulus-specific gene induction and protein phosphorylation. Nor-1 and Nur77 have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including the transduction of hormonal, inflammatory, mitogenic, apoptotic and differentiative signals. Cellular responses to these proteins suggest that they may function as homeostatic regulators of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, and thus may regulate cellular susceptibility to tumorigenesis. Their physiological functions, however, remain poorly understood. Here we describe a previously unsuspected function of Nor-1 and Nur77-as critical tumor suppressors of myeloid leukemogenesis. The abrogation of these proteins in mice led to rapidly lethal acute myeloid leukemia (AML), involving abnormal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors, decreased expression of the AP-1 transcription factors JunB and c-Jun and defective extrinsic apoptotic (Fas-L and TRAIL) signaling. We found that downregulation of NR4A3 ( NOR-1 ) and NR4A1 ( NUR77 ) was a common feature in leukemic blasts from human AML patients, irrespective of karyotype. Thus Nor-1 and Nur77 may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention in AML.","Mullican, Shannon E;Zhang, Shuo;Konopleva, Marina;Ruvolo, Vivian;Andreeff, Michael;Milbrandt, Jeffrey;Conneely, Orla M"
17515895,2007,Nature medicine,Targeting calcineurin activation as a therapeutic strategy for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Calcineurin is a calcium-activated serine/threonine phosphatase critical to a number of developmental processes in the cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. In the T-cell lineage, calcineurin activation is important for pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCR-mediated positive selection of thymocytes into mature T cells, and many aspects of the immune response. The critical role of calcineurin in the immune response is underscored by the fact that calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, are powerful immunosuppressants in wide clinical use. We observed sustained calcineurin activation in human B- and T-cell lymphomas and in all mouse models of lymphoid malignancies analyzed. In intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1)- and TEL-JAK2-induced T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, two mouse models relevant to human malignancies, in vivo inhibition of calcineurin activity by CsA or FK506 induced apoptosis of leukemic cells and rapid tumor clearance, and substantially prolonged mouse survival. In contrast, ectopic expression of a constitutively activated mutant of calcineurin favored leukemia progression. Moreover, CsA treatment induced apoptosis in human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Thus, calcineurin activation is critical for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in vivo, identifying this pathway as a relevant therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies.","Medyouf, Hind;Alcalde, Hélène;Berthier, Caroline;Guillemin, Marie Claude;dos Santos, Nuno R;Janin, Anne;Decaudin, Didier;de Thé, Hugues;Ghysdael, Jacques"

To determine the role of aberrant PI3K-AKT signaling in leiomyosarcoma pathogenesis, we genetically inactivated Pten in the smooth muscle cell lineage by cross-breeding Pten(loxP/loxP) mice with Tagln-cre mice. Mice carrying homozygous deletion of Pten alleles developed widespread smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and abdominal leiomyosarcomas, with a very rapid onset and elevated incidence (approximately 80%) compared to other animal models. Constitutive mTOR activation was restricted to the leiomyosarcomas, revealing the requirement for additional molecular events besides Pten loss. The rapamycin derivative everolimus substantially decelerated tumor growth on Tagln-cre/Pten(loxP/loxP) mice and prolonged their lifespan.

H. pylori-mediated upregulation of AID resulted in the accumulation of nucleotide alterations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in gastric cells in vitro.

We have previously shown that the combination of CD40 stimulation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) leads to synergistic antitumor responses in several models of advanced metastatic disease. We now report that after this treatment and other immunotherapy regimens, the CD4+ T-cell population, in contrast to CD8+ T cells, did not significantly increase but rather exhibited a substantial level of apoptosis that was dependent on IFN-gamma. Mice immunized with tumor cells and treated with an immunotherapy regimen that was initially protective were later unable to mount effective memory responses compared with immunized mice not receiving immunotherapy. Immunotherapy given to tumor-bearing Ifngr-/- mice resulted in restoration of secondary responses.

17334370,2007,Nature medicine,Airway epithelial gene expression in the diagnostic evaluation of smokers with suspect lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the US and the world. The high mortality rate (80-85% within 5 years) results, in part, from a lack of effective tools to diagnose the disease at an early stage. Given that cigarette smoke creates a field of injury throughout the airway, we sought to determine if gene expression in histologically normal large-airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy from smokers with suspicion of lung cancer could be used as a lung cancer biomarker. Using a training set (n = 77) and gene-expression profiles from Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays, we identified an 80-gene biomarker that distinguishes smokers with and without lung cancer. We tested the biomarker on an independent test set (n = 52), with an accuracy of 83% (80% sensitive, 84% specific), and on an additional validation set independently obtained from five medical centers (n = 35). Our biomarker had approximately 90% sensitivity for stage 1 cancer across all subjects. Combining cytopathology of lower airway cells obtained at bronchoscopy with the biomarker yielded 95% sensitivity and a 95% negative predictive value. These findings indicate that gene expression in cytologically normal large-airway epithelial cells can serve as a lung cancer biomarker, potentially owing to a cancer-specific airway-wide response to cigarette smoke.","Spira, Avrum;Beane, Jennifer E;Shah, Vishal;Steiling, Katrina;Liu, Gang;Schembri, Frank;Gilman, Sean;Dumas, Yves-Martine;Calner, Paul;Sebastiani, Paola;Sridhar, Sriram;Beamis, John;Lamb, Carla;Anderson, Timothy;Gerry, Norman;Keane, Joseph;Lenburg, Marc E;Brody, Jerome S"

17187072,2007,Nature medicine,Calreticulin exposure dictates the immunogenicity of cancer cell death.,"Anthracyclin-treated tumor cells are particularly effective in eliciting an anticancer immune response, whereas other DNA-damaging agents such as etoposide and mitomycin C do not induce immunogenic cell death. Here we show that anthracyclins induce the rapid, preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CRT) to the cell surface. Blockade or knockdown of CRT suppressed the phagocytosis of anthracyclin-treated tumor cells by dendritic cells and abolished their immunogenicity in mice. The anthracyclin-induced CRT translocation was mimicked by inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1/GADD34 complex. Administration of recombinant CRT or inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1/GADD34 restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and mitomycin C, and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo. These data identify CRT as a key feature determining anticancer immune responses and delineate a possible strategy for immunogenic chemotherapy.","Obeid, Michel;Tesniere, Antoine;Ghiringhelli, François;Fimia, Gian Maria;Apetoh, Lionel;Perfettini, Jean-Luc;Castedo, Maria;Mignot, Grégoire;Panaretakis, Theoharis;Casares, Noelia;Métivier, Didier;Larochette, Nathanael;van Endert, Peter;Ciccosanti, Fabiola;Piacentini, Mauro;Zitvogel, Laurence;Kroemer, Guido"
17173050,2007,Nature medicine,Targeting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in Notch1-induced T-cell leukemia.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), unlike other ALL types, is only infrequently associated with chromosomal aberrations, but it was recently shown that most individuals with T-ALL carry activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene. However, the signaling pathways and target genes responsible for Notch1-induced neoplastic transformation remain undefined. We report here that constitutively active Notch1 activates the NF-kappaB pathway transcriptionally and via the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, thereby causing increased expression of several well characterized target genes of NF-kappaB in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our observations demonstrate that the NF-kappaB pathway is highly active in established human T-ALL and that inhibition of the pathway can efficiently restrict tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify NF-kappaB as one of the major mediators of Notch1-induced transformation and suggest that the NF-kappaB pathway is a potential target of future therapies of T-ALL.","Vilimas, Tomas;Mascarenhas, Joaquina;Palomero, Teresa;Mandal, Malay;Buonamici, Silvia;Meng, Fanyong;Thompson, Benjamín;Spaulding, Christina;Macaroun, Sami;Alegre, Maria-Luisa;Kee, Barbara L;Ferrando, Adolfo;Miele, Lucio;Aifantis, Iannis"
17159988,2007,Nature medicine,Chromosome 5q deletion and epigenetic suppression of the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) in myeloid cell transformation.,"Interstitial loss of all or part of the long arm of chromosome 5, or del(5q), is a frequent clonal chromosomal abnormality in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, a preleukemic disorder) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by deleting one or more tumor-suppressor genes. Although a major commonly deleted region (CDR) has been delineated on chromosome band 5q31.1 (refs. 3-7), attempts to identify tumor suppressors within this band have been unsuccessful. We focused our analysis of gene expression on RNA from primitive leukemia-initiating cells, which harbor 5q deletions, and analyzed 12 genes within the CDR that are expressed by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here we show that the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) is expressed at a much lower level in leukemia-initiating stem cells from individuals with AML or MDS with a 5q deletion than in individuals with MDS or AML lacking a 5q deletion or in normal hematopoietic stem cells. Analysis of HL-60 cells, a myeloid leukemia line with deletion of the 5q31 region, showed that the CTNNA1 promoter of the retained allele is suppressed by both methylation and histone deacetylation. Restoration of CTNNA1 expression in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Thus, loss of expression of the alpha-catenin tumor suppressor in hematopoietic stem cells may provide a growth advantage that contributes to human MDS or AML with del(5q).","Liu, Ting Xi;Becker, Michael W;Jelinek, Jaroslav;Wu, Wen-Shu;Deng, Min;Mikhalkevich, Natallia;Hsu, Karl;Bloomfield, Clara D;Stone, Richard M;DeAngelo, Daniel J;Galinsky, Ilene A;Issa, Jean-Pierre;Clarke, Michael F;Look, A Thomas"

Expression of the immunosuppressive protein B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1), also known as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), is increased in many pathological conditions, including cancer. Here we show that expression of the gene encoding B7-H1 increases post transcriptionally in human glioma after loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. Tumor specimens from individuals with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) had levels of B7-H1 protein that correlated with PTEN loss, and tumor-specific T cells lysed human glioma targets expressing wild-type PTEN more effectively than those expressing mutant PTEN. These data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism linking loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN with immunoresistance, mediated in part by B7-H1.","Parsa, Andrew T;Waldron, James S;Panner, Amith;Crane, Courtney A;Parney, Ian F;Barry, Jeffrey J;Cachola, Kristine E;Murray, Joseph C;Tihan, Tarik;Jensen, Michael C;Mischel, Paul S;Stokoe, David;Pieper, Russell O"
17159986,2007,Nature medicine,NF-kappaB in breast cancer cells promotes osteolytic bone metastasis by inducing osteoclastogenesis via GM-CSF.,"Advanced breast cancers frequently metastasize to bone, resulting in osteolytic lesions, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a crucial role in the osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer by stimulating osteoclastogenesis. Using an in vivo bone metastasis model, we found that constitutive NF-kappaB activity in breast cancer cells is crucial for the bone resorption characteristic of osteolytic bone metastasis. We identified the gene encoding granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a key target of NF-kappaB and found that it mediates osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer by stimulating osteoclast development. Moreover, we observed that the expression of GM-CSF correlated with NF-kappaB activation in bone-metastatic tumor tissues from individuals with breast cancer. These results uncover a new and specific role of NF-kappaB in osteolytic bone metastasis through GM-CSF induction, suggesting that NF-kappaB is a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer and the prevention of skeletal metastasis.","Park, Bae Keun;Zhang, Honglai;Zeng, Qinghua;Dai, Jinlu;Keller, Evan T;Giordano, Thomas;Gu, Keni;Shah, Veena;Pei, Lei;Zarbo, Richard J;McCauley, Laurie;Shi, Songtao;Chen, Shaoqiong;Wang, Cun-Yu"

Here we describe a new approach for visualizing tumors whose fluorescence can be detected using telomerase-specific replication-competent adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (OBP-401). OBP-401 contains the replication cassette, in which the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter drives expression of E1 genes, and the GFP gene for monitoring viral replication. When OBP-401 was intratumorally injected into HT29 tumors orthotopically implanted into the rectum in BALB/c nu/nu mice, para-aortic lymph node metastasis could be visualized at laparotomy under a three-chip color cooled charged-coupled device camera. Our results indicate that OBP-401 causes viral spread into the regional lymphatic area and selectively replicates in neoplastic lesions, resulting in GFP expression in metastatic lymph nodes.

17013383,2006,Nature medicine,Dynamic modeling of imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia: functional insights and clinical implications.,"Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib represents a successful application of molecularly targeted cancer therapy. A rapid hematologic and cytogenetic response can be induced in the majority of people, even in advanced disease. However, complete eradication of malignant cells, which are characterized by the expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, is rare. Reasons for the persistence of the malignant clone are currently not known and provide a substantial challenge for clinicians and biologists. Based on a mathematical modeling approach that quantitatively explains a broad range of phenomena, we show for two independent datasets that clinically observed BCR-ABL1 transcript dynamics during imatinib treatment of CML can consistently be explained by a selective functional effect of imatinib on proliferative leukemia stem cells. Our results suggest the general potential of imatinib to induce a complete elimination of the malignant clone. Moreover, we predict that the therapeutic benefit of imatinib can, under certain circumstances, be accelerated by combination with proliferation-stimulating treatment strategies.","Roeder, Ingo;Horn, Matthias;Glauche, Ingmar;Hochhaus, Andreas;Mueller, Martin C;Loeffler, Markus"
16998484,2006,Nature medicine,Targeting of CD44 eradicates human acute myeloid leukemic stem cells.,"The long-term survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is dismally poor. A permanent cure of AML requires elimination of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), the only cell type capable of initiating and maintaining the leukemic clonal hierarchy. We report a therapeutic approach using an activating monoclonal antibody directed to the adhesion molecule CD44. In vivo administration of this antibody to nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune-deficient mice transplanted with human AML markedly reduced leukemic repopulation. Absence of leukemia in serially transplanted mice demonstrated that AML LSCs are directly targeted. Mechanisms underlying this eradication included interference with transport to stem cell-supportive microenvironmental niches and alteration of AML-LSC fate, identifying CD44 as a key regulator of AML LSCs. The finding that AML LSCs require interaction with a niche to maintain their stem cell properties provides a therapeutic strategy to eliminate quiescent AML LSCs and may be applicable to other types of cancer stem cells.","Jin, Liqing;Hope, Kristin J;Zhai, Qiongli;Smadja-Joffe, Florence;Dick, John E"
16998483,2006,Nature medicine,Requirement for CD44 in homing and engraftment of BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells.,"In individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, malignant progenitors in the graft contribute to leukemic relapse, but the mechanisms of homing and engraftment of leukemic CML stem cells are unknown. Here we show that CD44 expression is increased on mouse stem-progenitor cells expressing BCR-ABL and that CD44 contributes functional E-selectin ligands. In a mouse retroviral transplantation model of CML, BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors from CD44-mutant donors are defective in homing to recipient marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and impaired induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease. By contrast, CD44-deficient stem cells transduced with empty retrovirus engraft as efficiently as do wild-type HSCs. CD44 is dispensable for induction of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia by BCR-ABL, indicating that CD44 is specifically required on leukemic cells that initiate CML. The requirement for donor CD44 is bypassed by direct intrafemoral injection of BCR-ABL1-transduced CD44-deficient stem cells or by coexpression of human CD44. Antibody to CD44 attenuates induction of CML-like leukemia in recipients. These results show that BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for homing and engraftment than do normal HSCs, and argue that CD44 blockade may be beneficial in autologous transplantation in CML.","Krause, Daniela S;Lazarides, Katherine;von Andrian, Ulrich H;Van Etten, Richard A"
16892037,2006,Nature medicine,A previously unidentified alternatively spliced isoform of t(8;21) transcript promotes leukemogenesis.,"The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), identified in 15% of all cases of AML, including 40-50% of FAB M2 subtype and rare cases of M0, M1 and M4 subtypes. The most commonly known AML1-ETO fusion protein (full-length AML1-ETO) from this translocation has 752 amino acids and contains the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFalpha2 or PEBP2alphaB), including its DNA binding domain, and almost the entire RUNX1T1 (also known as MTG8 or ETO) protein. Although alterations of gene expression and hematopoietic cell proliferation have been reported in the presence of AML1-ETO, its expression does not lead to the development of leukemia. Here, we report the identification of a previously unknown alternatively spliced isoform of the AML1-ETO transcript, AML1-ETO9a, that includes an extra exon, exon 9a, of the ETO gene. AML1-ETO9a encodes a C-terminally truncated AML1-ETO protein of 575 amino acids. Expression of AML1-ETO9a leads to rapid development of leukemia in a mouse retroviral transduction-transplantation model. More importantly, coexpression of AML1-ETO and AML1-ETO9a results in the substantially earlier onset of AML and blocks myeloid cell differentiation at a more immature stage. These results indicate that fusion proteins from alternatively spliced isoforms of a chromosomal translocation may work together to induce cancer development.","Yan, Ming;Kanbe, Eiki;Peterson, Luke F;Boyapati, Anita;Miao, Yuqin;Wang, Yang;Chen, I-Ming;Chen, Zixing;Rowley, Janet D;Willman, Cheryl L;Zhang, Dong-Er"
16892036,2006,Nature medicine,Embryonic and tumorigenic pathways converge via Nodal signaling: role in melanoma aggressiveness.,"Bidirectional cellular communication is integral to both cancer progression and embryological development. In addition, aggressive tumor cells are phenotypically plastic, sharing many properties with embryonic cells. Owing to the similarities between these two types of cells, the developing zebrafish can be used as a biosensor for tumor-derived signals. Using this system, we show that aggressive melanoma cells secrete Nodal (a potent embryonic morphogen) and consequently can induce ectopic formation of the embryonic axis. We further show that Nodal is present in human metastatic tumors, but not in normal skin, and thus may be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Inhibition of Nodal signaling reduces melanoma cell invasiveness, colony formation and tumorigenicity. Nodal inhibition also promotes the reversion of melanoma cells toward a melanocytic phenotype. These data suggest that Nodal signaling has a key role in melanoma cell plasticity and tumorigenicity, thereby providing a previously unknown molecular target for regulating tumor progression.","Topczewska, Jolanta M;Postovit, Lynne-Marie;Margaryan, Naira V;Sam, Anthony;Hess, Angela R;Wheaton, William W;Nickoloff, Brian J;Topczewski, Jacek;Hendrix, Mary J C"
16862154,2006,Nature medicine,Interaction of KAI1 on tumor cells with DARC on vascular endothelium leads to metastasis suppression.,"CD82, also known as KAI1, was recently identified as a prostate cancer metastasis suppressor gene on human chromosome 11p1.2 (ref. 1). The product of CD82 is KAI1, a 40- to 75-kDa tetraspanin cell-surface protein also known as the leukocyte cell-surface marker CD82 (refs. 1,2). Downregulation of KAI1 has been found to be clinically associated with metastatic progression in a variety of cancers, whereas overexpression of CD82 specifically suppresses tumor metastasis in various animal models. To define the mechanism of action of KAI1, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified an endothelial cell-surface protein, DARC (also known as gp-Fy), as an interacting partner of KAI1. Our results indicate that the cancer cells expressing KAI1 attach to vascular endothelial cells through direct interaction between KAI1 and DARC, and that this interaction leads to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of senescence by modulating the expression of TBX2 and p21. Furthermore, the metastasis-suppression activity of KAI1 was significantly compromised in DARC knockout mice, whereas KAI1 completely abrogated pulmonary metastasis in wild-type and heterozygous littermates. These results provide direct evidence that DARC is essential for the function of CD82 as a suppressor of metastasis.","Bandyopadhyay, Sucharita;Zhan, Rui;Chaudhuri, Asok;Watabe, Misako;Pai, Sudha K;Hirota, Shigeru;Hosobe, Sadahiro;Tsukada, Taisei;Miura, Kunio;Takano, Yukio;Saito, Ken;Pauza, Mary E;Hayashi, Sunao;Wang, Ying;Mohinta, Sonia;Mashimo, Tomoyuki;Iiizumi, Megumi;Furuta, Eiji;Watabe, Kounosuke"
16862152,2006,Nature medicine,Chronic stress promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model of ovarian carcinoma.,"Stress can alter immunological, neurochemical and endocrinological functions, but its role in cancer progression is not well understood. Here, we show that chronic behavioral stress results in higher levels of tissue catecholamines, greater tumor burden and more invasive growth of ovarian carcinoma cells in an orthotopic mouse model. These effects are mediated primarily through activation of the tumor cell cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway by the beta(2) adrenergic receptor (encoded by ADRB2). Tumors in stressed animals showed markedly increased vascularization and enhanced expression of VEGF, MMP2 and MMP9, and we found that angiogenic processes mediated the effects of stress on tumor growth in vivo. These data identify beta-adrenergic activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway as a major mechanism by which behavioral stress can enhance tumor angiogenesis in vivo and thereby promote malignant cell growth. These data also suggest that blocking ADRB-mediated angiogenesis could have therapeutic implications for the management of ovarian cancer.","Thaker, Premal H;Han, Liz Y;Kamat, Aparna A;Arevalo, Jesusa M;Takahashi, Rie;Lu, Chunhua;Jennings, Nicholas B;Armaiz-Pena, Guillermo;Bankson, James A;Ravoori, Murali;Merritt, William M;Lin, Yvonne G;Mangala, Lingegowda S;Kim, Tae Jin;Coleman, Robert L;Landen, Charles N;Li, Yang;Felix, Edward;Sanguino, Angela M;Newman, Robert A;Lloyd, Mary;Gershenson, David M;Kundra, Vikas;Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel;Lutgendorf, Susan K;Cole, Steven W;Sood, Anil K"
16819549,2006,Nature medicine,E2-EPF UCP targets pVHL for degradation and associates with tumor growth and metastasis.,"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, pVHL, forms part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets specific substrates for degradation, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which is involved in tumor progression and angiogenesis. It remains unclear, however, how pVHL is destabilized. Here we show that E2-EPF ubiquitin carrier protein (UCP) associates with and targets pVHL for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in cells, thereby stabilizing HIF-1alpha. UCP is detected coincidently with HIF-1alpha in human primary liver, colon and breast tumors, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer cells. UCP level correlates inversely with pVHL level in most tumor cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, forced expression of UCP boosts tumor-cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis through effects on the pVHL-HIF pathway. Our results suggest that UCP helps stabilize HIF-1alpha and may be a new molecular target for therapeutic intervention in human cancers.","Jung, Cho-Rok;Hwang, Kyung-Sun;Yoo, Jinsang;Cho, Won-Kyung;Kim, Jin-Man;Kim, Woo Ho;Im, Dong-Soo"

Here we show that induction of tumor-cell apoptosis by an agonistic monoclonal antibody to DR5, the apoptosis-inducing receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), combined with T-cell activation by agonistic monoclonal antibodies to the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD137, potently and rapidly stimulated tumor-specific effector CD8+ T cells capable of eradicating preestablished tumors. Primary fibrosarcomas initiated with the carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), multiorgan metastases and a primary tumor containing as many as 90% tumor cells resistant to DR5-specific monoclonal antibody were rejected without apparent toxicity or induction of autoimmunity. This combination therapy of three monoclonal antibodies (trimAb) rapidly induced tumor-specific CD8+ T cells producing interferon (IFN)-gamma in the tumor-draining lymph node, consistent with a crucial requirement for CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma in the tumor rejection process. These results in mice indicate that a rational monoclonal antibody-based therapy that both causes tumor-cell apoptosis through DR5 and activates T cells may be an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy in humans.","Uno, Tomoyasu;Takeda, Kazuyoshi;Kojima, Yuko;Yoshizawa, Hirohisa;Akiba, Hisaya;Mittler, Robert S;Gejyo, Fumitake;Okumura, Ko;Yagita, Hideo;Smyth, Mark J"
16648858,2006,Nature medicine,Mig6 is a negative regulator of EGF receptor-mediated skin morphogenesis and tumor formation.,"The growing number of recently identified negative feedback regulators of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) highlights the importance of signal attenuation and modulation for correct signaling outcome. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6 also known as RALT or Gene 33) is a multiadaptor protein thought to be involved in the regulation of RTK and stress signaling. Here, we show that deletion of the mouse gene encoding Mig6 (designated Errfi1, which stands for ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1) causes hyperactivation of endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and sustained signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in overproliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Furthermore, Errfi1-/- mice develop spontaneous tumors in various organs and are highly susceptible to chemically induced formation of skin tumors. A tumor-suppressive role for Mig6 is supported by our finding that MIG6 is downregulated in various human cancers. Inhibition of endogenous Egfr signaling with the Egfr inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) or replacement of wild-type Egfr with the kinase-deficient protein encoded by the hypomorphic Egfr(wa2) allele completely rescued skin defects in Erffi1-/- mice. Carcinogen-induced tumors displayed by Errfi1-/- mice were highly sensitive to gefitinib.

Although the pathogenesis of ATLL remains incompletely understood, the viral regulatory protein Tax is centrally involved in cellular transformation. Here we describe the generation of HTLV-I Tax transgenic mice using the Lck proximal promoter to restrict transgene expression to developing thymocytes. After prolonged latency periods, transgenic mice developed diffuse large-cell lymphomas and leukemia with clinical, pathological and immunological features characteristic of acute ATLL. Transgenic mice were functionally immunocompromised and they developed opportunistic infections. Fulminant disease also developed rapidly in SCID mice after engraftment of lymphomatous cells from transgenic mice. Flow cytometry showed that the cells were CD4(-) and CD8(-), but CD44(+), CD25(+) and cytoplasmic CD3(+). This phenotype is indicative of a thymus-derived pre-T-cell phenotype, and disease development was associated with the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB.

Here we address whether the transcriptional characteristics of HCC can provide insight into the cellular origin of the tumor. We integrated gene expression data from rat fetal hepatoblasts and adult hepatocytes with HCC from human and mouse models. Individuals with HCC who shared a gene expression pattern with fetal hepatoblasts had a poor prognosis. The gene expression program that distinguished this subtype from other types of HCC included markers of hepatic oval cells, suggesting that HCC of this subtype may arise from hepatic progenitor cells. Analyses of gene networks showed that activation of AP-1 transcription factors in this newly identified HCC subtype might have key roles in tumor development.","Lee, Ju-Seog;Heo, Jeonghoon;Libbrecht, Louis;Chu, In-Sun;Kaposi-Novak, Pal;Calvisi, Diego F;Mikaelyan, Arsen;Roberts, Lewis R;Demetris, Anthony J;Sun, Zongtang;Nevens, Frederik;Roskams, Tania;Thorgeirsson, Snorri S"

Recent work indicates that a small population of cells endowed with unique self-renewal properties and tumorigenic potential is present in some, and perhaps all, tumors.

Generating effective CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to tumors is often impeded by T-cell tolerance to relevant tumor antigens, as most of these antigens are also expressed in normal tissues. We examined whether such tolerant T cells could be rescued and functionally restored for use in therapy of established tumors. We used a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) mouse model in which peripheral CD8+ T cells specific for a candidate tumor antigen also expressed in liver are tolerant, failing to proliferate or secrete interleukin (IL)-2 in response to antigen. Molecular and cellular analysis showed that these tolerant T cells expressed the IL-15 receptor alpha chain, and could be induced to proliferate in vitro in response to exogenous IL-15. Such proliferation abrogated tolerance and the rescued cells became effective in treating leukemia. Therefore, high-affinity CD8+ T cells are not necessarily deleted by encounter with self-antigen in the periphery, and can potentially be rescued and expanded for use in tumor immunotherapy.","Teague, Ryan M;Sather, Blythe D;Sacks, Jilian A;Huang, Maria Z;Dossett, Michelle L;Morimoto, Junko;Tan, Xiaoxio;Sutton, Susan E;Cooke, Michael P;Ohlén, Claes;Greenberg, Philip D"
16444265,2006,Nature medicine,A novel dendritic cell subset involved in tumor immunosurveillance.,"The interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced TRAIL effector mechanism is a vital component of cancer immunosurveillance by natural killer (NK) cells in mice. Here we show that the main source of IFN-gamma is not the conventional NK cell but a subset of B220(+)Ly6C(-) dendritic cells, which are atypical insofar as they express NK cell-surface molecules. Upon contact with a variety of tumor cells that are poorly recognized by NK cells, B220(+)NK1.1(+) dendritic cells secrete high levels of IFN-gamma and mediate TRAIL-dependent lysis of tumor cells. Adoptive transfer of these IFN-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDCs) into tumor-bearing Rag2(-/-)Il2rg(-/-) mice prevented tumor outgrowth, whereas transfer of conventional NK cells did not. In conclusion, we identified IKDCs as pivotal sensors and effectors of the innate antitumor immune response.","Taieb, Julien;Chaput, Nathalie;Ménard, Cédric;Apetoh, Lionel;Ullrich, Evelyn;Bonmort, Mathieu;Péquignot, Marie;Casares, Noelia;Terme, Magali;Flament, Caroline;Opolon, Paule;Lecluse, Yann;Métivier, Didier;Tomasello, Elena;Vivier, Eric;Ghiringhelli, François;Martin, François;Klatzmann, David;Poynard, Thierry;Tursz, Thomas;Raposo, Graça;Yagita, Hideo;Ryffel, Bernard;Kroemer, Guido;Zitvogel, Laurence"
16444264,2006,Nature medicine,Autoimmunity and tumor immunity induced by immune responses to mutations in self.,"Little is known about the consequences of immune recognition of mutated gene products, despite their potential relevance to autoimmunity and tumor immunity. To identify mutations that induce immunity, here we have developed a systematic approach in which combinatorial DNA libraries encoding large numbers of random mutations in two syngeneic tyrosinase-related proteins are used to immunize black mice. We show that the libraries of mutated DNA induce autoimmune hypopigmentation and tumor immunity through cross-recognition of nonmutated gene products. Truncations are present in all immunogenic clones and are sufficient to elicit immunity to self, triggering recognition of normally silent epitopes. Immunity is further enhanced by specific amino acid substitutions that promote T helper cell responses. Thus, presentation of a vast repertoire of antigen variants to the immune system can enhance the generation of adaptive immune responses to self.","Engelhorn, Manuel E;Guevara-Patiño, José A;Noffz, Gabriele;Hooper, Andrea T;Lou, Olivia;Gold, Jason S;Kappel, Barry J;Houghton, Alan N"
16369543,2006,Nature medicine,A role for the scaffolding adapter GAB2 in breast cancer.,"The scaffolding adapter GAB2 maps to a region (11q13-14) commonly amplified in human breast cancer, and is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors, but its functional role in mammary carcinogenesis has remained unexplored. We found that overexpression of GAB2 (Grb2-associated binding protein 2) increases proliferation of MCF10A mammary cells in three-dimensional culture. Coexpression of GAB2 with antiapoptotic oncogenes causes lumenal filling, whereas coexpression with Neu (also known as ErbB2 and HER2) results in an invasive phenotype. These effects of GAB2 are mediated by hyperactivation of the Shp2-Erk pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas deficiency of Gab2 ameliorates, Neu-evoked breast carcinogenesis in mice. Finally, GAB2 is amplified in some GAB2-overexpressing human breast tumors. Our data suggest that GAB2 may be a key gene within an 11q13 amplicon in human breast cancer and propose a role for overexpression of GAB2 in mammary carcinogenesis. Agents that target GAB2 or GAB2-dependent pathways may be useful for treating breast tumors that overexpress GAB2 or HER2 or both.","Bentires-Alj, Mohamed;Gil, Susana G;Chan, Richard;Wang, Zhigang C;Wang, Yongping;Imanaka, Naoko;Harris, Lyndsay N;Richardson, Andrea;Neel, Benjamin G;Gu, Haihua"
16341243,2006,Nature medicine,Hypoxia-inducible factor determines sensitivity to inhibitors of mTOR in kidney cancer.,"Inhibitors of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have shown sporadic activity in cancer trials, leading to confusion about the appropriate clinical setting for their use. Here we show that loss of the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) sensitizes kidney cancer cells to the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 in vitro and in mouse models. Growth arrest caused by CCI-779 correlates with a block in translation of mRNA encoding hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A), and is rescued by expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking the 5' untranslated region. VHL-deficient tumors show increased uptake of the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an mTOR-dependent manner. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for prospective, biomarker-driven clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors in kidney cancer and suggest that FDG-PET scans may have use as a pharmacodynamic marker in this setting.","Thomas, George V;Tran, Chris;Mellinghoff, Ingo K;Welsbie, Derek S;Chan, Emily;Fueger, Barbara;Czernin, Johannes;Sawyers, Charles L"
16288283,2005,Nature medicine,Inhibiting Stat3 signaling in the hematopoietic system elicits multicomponent antitumor immunity.,"The immune system can act as an extrinsic suppressor of tumors. Therefore, tumor progression depends in part on mechanisms that downmodulate intrinsic immune surveillance. Identifying these inhibitory pathways may provide promising targets to enhance antitumor immunity. Here, we show that Stat3 is constitutively activated in diverse tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and ablating Stat3 in hematopoietic cells triggers an intrinsic immune-surveillance system that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. We observed a markedly enhanced function of dendritic cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils in tumor-bearing mice with Stat3(-/-) hematopoietic cells, and showed that tumor regression requires immune cells. Targeting Stat3 with a small-molecule drug induces T cell- and NK cell-dependent growth inhibition of established tumors otherwise resistant to direct killing by the inhibitor. Our findings show that Stat3 signaling restrains natural tumor immune surveillance and that inhibiting hematopoietic Stat3 in tumor-bearing hosts elicits multicomponent therapeutic antitumor immunity.","Kortylewski, Marcin;Kujawski, Maciej;Wang, Tianhong;Wei, Sheng;Zhang, Shumin;Pilon-Thomas, Shari;Niu, Guilian;Kay, Heidi;Mulé, James;Kerr, William G;Jove, Richard;Pardoll, Drew;Yu, Hua"
16286923,2005,Nature medicine,R-Ras is a global regulator of vascular regeneration that suppresses intimal hyperplasia and tumor angiogenesis.,"R-Ras is a small GTPase of the Ras family that regulates cell survival and integrin activity. Despite a number of in vitro studies, the in vivo function of R-Ras remains unclear. Here, we used R-Ras-null mice to explore the in vivo function of this small GTPase. Our results show a role for R-Ras as a regulator of vascular differentiation that primarily affects the remodeling of blood vessels. We show that R-Ras-null mice, although otherwise phenotypically normal, mount excessive vascular responses. We found that in vivo R-Ras expression is largely confined to fully differentiated smooth muscle cells, including those of blood vessels, and to endothelial cells. Challenging the R-Ras-null mice with arterial injury or tumor implantation showed exaggerated neointimal thickening in response to the injury and increased angiogenesis in the tumors. In wild-type mice, R-Ras expression was greatly reduced in hyperplastic neointimal smooth muscle cells and in angiogenic endothelial cells. Forced expression of activated R-Ras suppressed mitogenic and invasive activities of growth factor-stimulated vascular cells. These results establish an unexpected role for R-Ras in blood vessel homeostasis and suggest that R-Ras signaling may offer a target for therapeutic intervention in vascular diseases.","Komatsu, Masanobu;Ruoslahti, Erkki"

Human colon cancer xenografts as small as approximately 0.15 g were disclosed in nude mice within 1 h of giving the radiotracer, with tumor/blood ratios increased by >or=40-fold (approximately 10:1 at 1 h, approximately 100:1 at 24 h), compared to a (99m)Tc-labeled CEA-specific F(ab') used clinically for colorectal cancer detection, while also increasing tumor uptake tenfold ( approximately 20% injected dose/g) under optimal conditions.

16227989,2005,Nature medicine,T cells targeted against a single minor histocompatibility antigen can cure solid tumors.,"T cells responsive to minor histocompatibility (H) antigens are extremely effective in curing leukemia but it remains unknown whether they can eradicate solid tumors. We report that injection of CD8(+) T cells primed against the immunodominant H7(a) minor H antigen can cure established melanomas in mice. Tumor rejection was initiated by preferential extravasation at the tumor site of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing H7(a)-specific T cells. Intratumoral release of IFN-gamma had two crucial effects: inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on tumor cells. Despite ubiquitous expression of H7(a), dissemination of a few H7(a)-specific T cells in extralymphoid organs caused neither graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) nor vitiligo because host nonhematopoietic cells were protected by their low expression of MHC class I. Our preclinical model yields unique insights into how minor H antigen-based immunotherapy could be used to treat human solid tumors.","Meunier, Marie-Christine;Delisle, Jean-Sébastien;Bergeron, Julie;Rineau, Vincent;Baron, Chantal;Perreault, Claude"
16170322,2005,Nature medicine,"Tumor-targeted, systemic delivery of therapeutic viral vectors using hitchhiking on antigen-specific T cells.","Antigen-specific T cells circulate freely and accumulate specifically at sites of antigen expression. To enhance the survival and targeting of systemically delivered viral vectors, we exploited the observation that retroviral particles adhere nonspecifically, or 'hitchhike,' to the surface of T cells. Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells, loaded with viruses encoding interleukin (IL)-12 or Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk), cured established metastatic disease where adoptive T-cell transfer alone was not effective. Productive hand off correlated with local heparanase expression either from malignant tumor cells and/or as a result of T-cell activation by antigen, providing high levels of selectivity for viral transfer to metastatic tumors in vivo. Protection, concentration and targeting of viruses by adsorption to cell carriers represent a new technique for systemic delivery of vectors, in fully immunocompetent hosts, for a variety of diseases in which delivery of genes may be therapeutically beneficial.","Cole, Caroline;Qiao, Jian;Kottke, Timothy;Diaz, Rosa Maria;Ahmed, Atique;Sanchez-Perez, Luis;Brunn, Gregory;Thompson, Jill;Chester, John;Vile, Richard G"
16127434,2005,Nature medicine,Induction of interleukin-8 preserves the angiogenic response in HIF-1alpha-deficient colon cancer cells.,"Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is considered a crucial mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia through its regulation of genes that control angiogenesis. It represents an attractive therapeutic target in colon cancer, one of the few tumor types that shows a clinical response to antiangiogenic therapy. But it is unclear whether inhibition of HIF-1 alone is sufficient to block tumor angiogenesis. In HIF-1alpha knockdown DLD-1 colon cancer cells (DLD-1(HIF-kd)), the hypoxic induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was only partially blocked. Xenografts remained highly vascularized with microvessel densities identical to DLD-1 tumors that had wild-type HIF-1alpha (DLD-1(HIF-wt)). In addition to the preserved expression of VEGF, the proangiogenic cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 was induced by hypoxia in DLD-1(HIF-kd) but not DLD-1(HIF-wt) cells. This induction was mediated by the production of hydrogen peroxide and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, the KRAS oncogene, which is commonly mutated in colon cancer, enhanced the hypoxic induction of IL-8. A neutralizing antibody to IL-8 substantially inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in DLD-1(HIF-kd) but not DLD-1(HIF-wt) xenografts, verifying the functional significance of this IL-8 response. Thus, compensatory pathways can be activated to preserve the tumor angiogenic response, and strategies that inhibit HIF-1alpha may be most effective when IL-8 is simultaneously targeted.","Mizukami, Yusuke;Jo, Won-Seok;Duerr, Eva-Maria;Gala, Manish;Li, Jingnan;Zhang, Xiaobo;Zimmer, Michael A;Iliopoulos, Othon;Zukerberg, Lawrence R;Kohgo, Yutaka;Lynch, Maureen P;Rueda, Bo R;Chung, Daniel C"
16116429,2005,Nature medicine,Vaccine-induced tumor-specific immunity despite severe B-cell depletion in mantle cell lymphoma.,"The role of B cells in T-cell priming is unclear, and the effects of B-cell depletion on immune responses to cancer vaccines are unknown. Although results from some mouse models suggest that B cells may inhibit induction of T cell-dependent immunity by competing with antigen-presenting cells for antigens, skewing T helper response toward a T helper 2 profile and/or inducing T-cell tolerance, results from others suggest that B cells are necessary for priming as well as generation of T-cell memory. We assessed immune responses to a well-characterized idiotype vaccine in individuals with severe B-cell depletion but normal T cells after CD20-specific antibody-based chemotherapy of mantle cell lymphoma in first remission. Humoral antigen- and tumor-specific responses were detectable but delayed, and they correlated with peripheral blood B-cell recovery. In contrast, vigorous CD4(+) and CD8(+) antitumor type I T-cell cytokine responses were induced in most individuals in the absence of circulating B cells. Analysis of relapsing tumors showed no mutations or change in expression of target antigen to explain escape from therapy. These results show that severe B-cell depletion does not impair T-cell priming in humans. Based on these results, it is justifiable to administer vaccines in the setting of B-cell depletion; however, vaccine boosts after B-cell recovery may be necessary for optimal humoral responses.","Neelapu, Sattva S;Kwak, Larry W;Kobrin, Carol B;Reynolds, Craig W;Janik, John E;Dunleavy, Kieron;White, Therese;Harvey, Linda;Pennington, Robin;Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice;Jaffe, Elaine S;Steinberg, Seth M;Gress, Ronald;Hakim, Fran;Wilson, Wyndham H"
16041381,2005,Nature medicine,Hyperactivation of Stat3 in gp130 mutant mice promotes gastric hyperproliferation and desensitizes TGF-beta signaling.,"The latent transcription factor Stat3 is activated by gp130, the common receptor for the interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine family and other growth factor and cytokine receptors. Ligand-induced dimerization of gp130 leads to activation of the Stat1, Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling pathways. Here we assess genetically the contribution of exaggerated Stat3 activation to the phenotype of gp130 (Y757F/Y757F) mice, in which a knock-in mutation disrupts the negative feedback mechanism on gp130-dependent Stat signaling. Compared to gp130 (Y757F/Y757F) mice, reduced Stat3 activation in gp130 (Y757F/Y757F) Stat3(+/-) mice increased their lifespan, prevented splenomegaly, normalized exaggerated hepatic acute-phase response and lymphocyte trafficking, and suppressed the growth of spontaneously arising gastric adenomas in young mice. These lesions share histological features of gastric polyps in aging mice with monoallelic null mutations in Smad4, which encodes the common transducer for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. Indeed, hyperactivation of Stat3 desensitizes gp130 (Y757F/Y757F) cells to the cytostatic effect of TGF-beta through transcriptional induction of inhibitory Smad7, thereby providing a novel link for cross-talk between Stat and Smad signaling in gastric homeostasis.","Jenkins, Brendan J;Grail, Dianne;Nheu, Thao;Najdovska, Meri;Wang, Bo;Waring, Paul;Inglese, Melissa;McLoughlin, Rachel M;Jones, Simon A;Topley, Nicholas;Baumann, Heinz;Judd, Louise M;Giraud, Andrew S;Boussioutas, Alex;Zhu, Hong-Jian;Ernst, Matthias"
15908956,2005,Nature medicine,Distinct patterns of hematopoietic stem cell involvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"The cellular targets of primary mutations and malignant transformation remain elusive in most cancers. Here, we show that clinically and genetically different subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) originate and transform at distinct stages of hematopoietic development. Primary ETV6-RUNX1 (also known as TEL-AML1) fusions and subsequent leukemic transformations were targeted to committed B-cell progenitors. Major breakpoint BCR-ABL1 fusions (encoding P210 BCR-ABL1) originated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas minor BCR-ABL1 fusions (encoding P190 BCR-ABL1) had a B-cell progenitor origin, suggesting that P190 and P210 BCR-ABL1 ALLs represent largely distinct tumor biological and clinical entities. The transformed leukemia-initiating stem cells in both P190 and P210 BCR-ABL1 ALLs had, as in ETV6-RUNX1 ALLs, a committed B progenitor phenotype. In all patients, normal and leukemic repopulating stem cells could successfully be separated prospectively, and notably, the size of the normal HSC compartment in ETV6-RUNX1 and P190 BCR-ABL1 ALLs was found to be unaffected by the expansive leukemic stem cell population.","Castor, Anders;Nilsson, Lars;Astrand-Grundström, Ingbritt;Buitenhuis, Miranda;Ramirez, Carole;Anderson, Kristina;Strömbeck, Bodil;Garwicz, Stanislaw;Békássy, Albert N;Schmiegelow, Kjeld;Lausen, Birgitte;Hokland, Peter;Lehmann, Sören;Juliusson, Gunnar;Johansson, Bertil;Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W"
15895073,2005,Nature medicine,Stat3 is required for ALK-mediated lymphomagenesis and provides a possible therapeutic target.,"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are caused by chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proto-oncogene to a dimerization partner, resulting in constitutive expression of ALK and ALK tyrosine kinase activity. One substrate of activated ALK in human ALCLs is the transcription factor Stat3, and its phosphorylation is accurately recapitulated in a new nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK transgenic mouse model of lymphomagenesis. Here we show by gene targeting that Stat3 is required for the transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro, for the development of B-cell lymphoma in transgenic mice and for the growth and survival of both human and mouse NPM-ALK-transformed B and T cells. Ablation of Stat3 expression by antisense oligonucleotides significantly (P < 0.0001) impaired the growth of human and mouse NPM-ALK tumors in vivo.

Standard fluorophores hamper simultaneous intravital imaging of these components.

15864314,2005,Nature medicine,ATM regulates target switching to escalating doses of radiation in the intestines.,"Although stem cells succumbing to reproductive death are assumed to be the single relevant targets in radiation tissue damage, recent studies showed intestinal stem cell damage is conditionally linked to crypt endothelial apoptosis, defining a two-target model. Here we report that when mouse intestines were protected against microvascular apoptosis, radiation switched as the dose escalated to a previously unrecognized crypt stem cell target, activating ceramide synthase-mediated apoptosis to initiate intestinal damage. Whereas ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase normally represses ceramide synthase, its derepression in Atm(-/-) mice increased crypt stem cell radiosensitivity 3.7-fold without sensitizing the microvascular response. Discovery of this intestinal radiosensitivity mechanism allowed design of an antisense Atm oligonucleotide treatment which phenocopied the Atm(-/-) mouse, reordering ceramide synthase-mediated stem cell death to become the first-line gastrointestinal response of wild-type littermates. These experiments indicate that tissues operate multiple potential targets activated consecutively according to their inherent radiosensitivities that may be reordered therapeutically to control radiation tissue responses.","Ch'ang, Hui-Ju;Maj, Jerzy G;Paris, François;Xing, H Rosie;Zhang, Jianjun;Truman, Jean-Philip;Cardon-Cardo, Carlos;Haimovitz-Friedman, Adriana;Kolesnick, Richard;Fuks, Zvi"

15821746,2005,Nature medicine,Lineage infidelity of epithelial ovarian cancers is controlled by HOX genes that specify regional identity in the reproductive tract.,"Although epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) have been thought to arise from the simple epithelium lining the ovarian surface or inclusion cysts, the major subtypes of EOCs show morphologic features that resemble those of the müllerian duct-derived epithelia of the reproductive tract. We found that HOX genes, which normally regulate mullerian duct differentiation, are not expressed in normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), but are expressed in different EOC subtypes according to the pattern of mullerian-like differentiation of these cancers. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 in tumorigenic mouse OSE cells gave rise to papillary tumors resembling serous EOCs. In contrast, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 induced morphogenesis of endometrioid-like and mucinous-like EOCs, respectively. Hoxa7 showed no lineage specificity, but promoted the abilities of Hoxa9, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 to induce differentiation along their respective pathways. Therefore, inappropriate activation of a molecular program that controls patterning of the reproductive tract could explain the morphologic heterogeneity of EOCs and their assumption of müllerian-like features.","Cheng, Wenjun;Liu, Jinsong;Yoshida, Hiroyuki;Rosen, Daniel;Naora, Honami"

A mouse cancer model of metastatic melanoma was used to test intravenous targeting with m168. Human P-glycoprotein was ectopically expressed on the surface of melanoma cells and targeted by the m168 pseudotyped lentiviral vector conjugated with antibody specific for P-glycoprotein. m168 pseudotypes successfully targeted metastatic melanoma cells growing in the lung after systemic administration by tail vein injection.

15619634,2005,Nature medicine,Inhibitors of histone deacetylases induce tumor-selective apoptosis through activation of the death receptor pathway.,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription and specific cellular functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer. Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACIs) possess antitumor activity and are well tolerated, supporting the idea that their use might develop as a specific strategy for cancer treatment. The molecular basis for their selective antitumor activity is, however, unknown. We investigated the effects of HDACIs on leukemias expressing the PML-RAR or AML1-ETO oncoproteins, known to initiate leukemogenesis through deregulation of HDACs. Here we report that: (i) HDACIs induce apoptosis of leukemic blasts, although oncogene expression is not sufficient to confer HDACI sensitivity to normal cells; (ii) apoptosis is p53 independent and depends, both in vitro and in vivo, upon activation of the death receptor pathway (TRAIL and Fas signaling pathways); (iii) TRAIL, DR5, FasL and Fas are upregulated by HDACIs in the leukemic cells, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors.

15619633,2005,Nature medicine,Tumor-selective action of HDAC inhibitors involves TRAIL induction in acute myeloid leukemia cells.,"Chromatin is a dynamic macromolecular structure epigenetically modified to regulate specific gene expression. Altered chromatin function can lead to aberrant expression of growth regulators and may, ultimately, cause cancer. That many human diseases have epigenetic etiology has stimulated the development of 'epigenetic' therapies. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACIs) induce proliferation arrest, maturation and apoptosis of cancer cells, but not normal cells, in vitro and in vivo, and are currently being tested in clinical trials. We investigated the mechanism(s) underlying this tumor selectivity. We report that HDACIs induce, in addition to p21, expression of TRAIL (Apo2L, TNFSF10) by directly activating the TNFSF10 promoter, thereby triggering tumor-selective death signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and the blasts of individuals with AML. RNA interference revealed that the induction of p21, TRAIL and differentiation are separable activities of HDACIs. HDACIs induced proliferation arrest, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and suppression of AML blast clonogenicity irrespective of French-American-British (FAB) classification status, karyotype and immunophenotype. No apoptosis was seen in normal CD34(+) progenitor cells.

We have developed a set of novel 'tissue print' and 'print-phoresis' technologies to facilitate tissue and tumor-marker profiling under these circumstances. Tissue printing transfers cells and extracellular matrix components from a tissue surface onto nitrocellulose membranes, generating a two-dimensional anatomical image on which molecular markers can be visualized by specific protein and RNA- and DNA-detection techniques. Print-phoresis is a complementary new electrophoresis method in which thin strips from the print are subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, providing a straightforward interface between the tissue-print image and gel-based proteomic techniques. Here we have utilized these technologies to identify and characterize markers of tumor invasion of the prostate capsule, an event generally not apparent to the naked eye that may result in tumor at the surgical margins ('positive margins'). We have also shown that tissue-print technologies can provide a general platform for the generation of marker maps that can be superimposed directly onto histopathological and radiological images, permitting molecular identification and classification of individual malignant lesions.","Gaston, Sandra M;Soares, Marc A;Siddiqui, M Minhaj;Vu, Dang;Lee, Jung M;Goldner, Dana L;Brice, Mark J;Shih, Jennifer C;Upton, Melissa P;Perides, George;Baptista, Jovanna;Lavin, Philip T;Bloch, B Nicolas;Genega, Elizabeth M;Rubin, Mark A;Lenkinski, Robert E"
15619626,2005,Nature medicine,Role of K-ras and Pten in the development of mouse models of endometriosis and endometrioid ovarian cancer.,"Epithelial ovarian tumors present a complex clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of the difficulty of early detection, lack of known precursor lesions and high mortality rates. Endometrioid ovarian carcinomas are frequently associated with endometriosis, but the mechanism for this association remains unknown. Here we present the first genetic models of peritoneal endometriosis and endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinoma in mice, both based on the activation of an oncogenic K-ras allele. In addition, we find that expression of oncogenic K-ras or conditional Pten deletion within the ovarian surface epithelium gives rise to preneoplastic ovarian lesions with an endometrioid glandular morphology. Furthermore, the combination of the two mutations in the ovary leads to the induction of invasive and widely metastatic endometrioid ovarian adenocarcinomas with complete penetrance and a disease latency of only 7 weeks.

The interface through which the BCL6 BTB domain mediates recruitment of the SMRT, NCoR and BCoR corepressors was recently identified. To determine the contribution of this interface to BCL6 transcriptional and biological properties, we generated a peptide that specifically binds BCL6 and blocks corepressor recruitment in vivo. This inhibitor disrupts BCL6-mediated repression and establishment of silenced chromatin, reactivates natural BCL6 target genes, and abrogates BCL6 biological function in B cells.

15502845,2004,Nature medicine,Dissecting tumor maintenance requirements using bioluminescence imaging of cell proliferation in a mouse glioma model.,"Bioluminescence imaging has previously been used to monitor the formation of grafted tumors in vivo and measure cell number during tumor progression and response to therapy. The development and optimization of successful cancer therapy strategies may well require detailed and specific assessment of biological processes in response to mechanistic intervention. Here, we use bioluminescence imaging to monitor the cell cycle in a genetically engineered, histologically accurate model of glioma in vivo. In these platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-driven oligodendrogliomas, G1 cell-cycle arrest is generated by blockade of either the PDGF receptor or mTOR using small-molecule inhibitors.","Uhrbom, Lene;Nerio, Edward;Holland, Eric C"
15502842,2004,Nature medicine,The RAB25 small GTPase determines aggressiveness of ovarian and breast cancers.,"High-density array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed amplification of chromosome 1q22 centered on the RAB25 small GTPase, which is implicated in apical vesicle trafficking, in approximately half of ovarian and breast cancers. RAB25 mRNA levels were selectively increased in stage III and IV serous epithelial ovarian cancers compared to other genes within the amplified region, implicating RAB25 as a driving event in the development of the amplicon. Increased DNA copy number or RNA level of RAB25 was associated with markedly decreased disease-free survival or overall survival in ovarian and breast cancers, respectively. Forced expression of RAB25 markedly increased anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell proliferation, prevented apoptosis and anoikis, including that induced by chemotherapy, and increased aggressiveness of cancer cells in vivo. The inhibition of apoptosis was associated with a decrease in expression of the proapoptotic molecules, BAK and BAX, and activation of the antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and AKT pathway, providing potential mechanisms for the effects of RAB25 on tumor aggressiveness. Overall, these studies implicate RAB25, and thus the RAB family of small G proteins, in aggressiveness of epithelial cancers.","Cheng, Kwai Wa;Lahad, John P;Kuo, Wen-Lin;Lapuk, Anna;Yamada, Kyosuke;Auersperg, Nelly;Liu, Jinsong;Smith-McCune, Karen;Lu, Karen H;Fishman, David;Gray, Joe W;Mills, Gordon B"

Lyn siRNA reduced Lyn protein in both normal hematopoietic cells and BCR-ABL1-expressing (BCR-ABL1(+)) blasts by 80-95%. Within 48 h, siRNA-treated BCR-ABL1(+) blasts underwent apoptosis, whereas normal cells remained viable.

We are experimenting with a prototype VCT scanner that uses flat-panel X-ray detectors and is designed for high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Using this technique, we have demonstrated microangiography of xeno-transplanted skin squamous cell carcinomas in nude mice. VCT shows the vessel architecture of tumors and animals with greater detail and plasticity than has previously been achieved, and is superior to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. VCT and MR images correlate well for larger tumor vessels, which are tracked from their origin on 3D reconstructions of VCT images. When compared with histology, small tumor vessels with a diameter as small as 50 microm were clearly visualized. Furthermore, imaging small vessel networks inside the tumor tissue improved discrimination of vital and necrotic regions. Thus, VCT substantially improves imaging of vascularization in tumors and offers a promising tool for preclinical studies of tumor angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapies.","Kiessling, Fabian;Greschus, Susanne;Lichy, Matthias P;Bock, Michael;Fink, Christian;Vosseler, Silvia;Moll, Jens;Mueller, Margareta M;Fusenig, Norbert E;Traupe, Horst;Semmler, Wolfhard"

15334072,2004,Nature medicine,Tracking metastatic tumor cell extravasation with quantum dot nanocrystals and fluorescence emission-scanning microscopy.,"Metastasis is an impediment to the development of effective cancer therapies. Our understanding of metastasis is limited by our inability to follow this process in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy offers the potential to follow cells at high resolution in living animals. Semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots (QDs), offer considerable advantages over organic fluorophores for this purpose. We used QDs and emission spectrum scanning multiphoton microscopy to develop a means to study extravasation in vivo. Although QD labeling shows no deleterious effects on cultured cells, concern over their potential toxicity in vivo has caused resistance toward their application to such studies. To test if effects of QD labeling emerge in vivo, tumor cells labeled with QDs were intravenously injected into mice and followed as they extravasated into lung tissue. The behavior of QD-labeled tumor cells in vivo was indistinguishable from that of unlabeled cells. QDs and spectral imaging allowed the simultaneous identification of five different populations of cells using multiphoton laser excitation. Besides establishing the safety of QDs for in vivo studies, our approach permits the study of multicellular interactions in vivo.","Voura, Evelyn B;Jaiswal, Jyoti K;Mattoussi, Hedi;Simon, Sanford M"

15322536,2004,Nature medicine,Specific recruitment of regulatory T cells in ovarian carcinoma fosters immune privilege and predicts reduced survival.,"Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells mediate homeostatic peripheral tolerance by suppressing autoreactive T cells. Failure of host antitumor immunity may be caused by exaggerated suppression of tumor-associated antigen-reactive lymphocytes mediated by T(reg) cells; however, definitive evidence that T(reg) cells have an immunopathological role in human cancer is lacking. Here we show, in detailed studies of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T(reg) cells in 104 individuals affected with ovarian carcinoma, that human tumor T(reg) cells suppress tumor-specific T cell immunity and contribute to growth of human tumors in vivo. We also show that tumor T(reg) cells are associated with a high death hazard and reduced survival. Human T(reg) cells preferentially move to and accumulate in tumors and ascites, but rarely enter draining lymph nodes in later cancer stages. Tumor cells and microenvironmental macrophages produce the chemokine CCL22, which mediates trafficking of T(reg) cells to the tumor. This specific recruitment of T(reg) cells represents a mechanism by which tumors may foster immune privilege. Thus, blocking T(reg) cell migration or function may help to defeat human cancer.","Curiel, Tyler J;Coukos, George;Zou, Linhua;Alvarez, Xavier;Cheng, Pui;Mottram, Peter;Evdemon-Hogan, Melina;Conejo-Garcia, Jose R;Zhang, Lin;Burow, Matthew;Zhu, Yun;Wei, Shuang;Kryczek, Ilona;Daniel, Ben;Gordon, Alan;Myers, Leann;Lackner, Andrew;Disis, Mary L;Knutson, Keith L;Chen, Lieping;Zou, Weiping"

Clinical trials are now testing whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition is useful in treating PTEN-null cancers. Here, we report that mTOR inhibition induced apoptosis of epithelial cells and the complete reversal of a neoplastic phenotype in the prostate of mice expressing human AKT1 in the ventral prostate. Induction of cell death required the mitochondrial pathway, as prostate-specific coexpression of BCL2 blocked apoptosis. Thus, there is an mTOR-dependent survival signal required downstream of Akt. Bcl2 expression, however, only partially restored intraluminal cell growth in the setting of mTOR inhibition. Expression profiling showed that Hif-1 alpha targets, including genes encoding most glycolytic enzymes, constituted the dominant transcriptional response to AKT activation and mTOR inhibition. These data suggest that the expansion of AKT-driven prostate epithelial cells requires mTOR-dependent survival signaling and activation of HIF-1 alpha, and that clinical resistance to mTOR inhibitors may emerge through BCL2 expression and/or upregulation of HIF-1 alpha activity.","Majumder, Pradip K;Febbo, Phillip G;Bikoff, Rachel;Berger, Raanan;Xue, Qi;McMahon, Louis M;Manola, Judith;Brugarolas, James;McDonnell, Timothy J;Golub, Todd R;Loda, Massimo;Lane, Heidi A;Sellers, William R"

We isolated a germline translocation breakpoint at 20q11 from a bladder cancer patient. We identified CDC91L1, the gene encoding CDC91L1 (also called phosphatidylinositol glycan class U (PIG-U), a transamidase complex unit in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring pathway), as the only gene whose expression was affected by the translocation. CDC91L1 was amplified and overexpressed in about one-third of bladder cancer cell lines and primary tumors, as well as in oncogenic uroepithelial cells transformed with human papillomavirus (HPV) E7. Forced overexpression of CDC91L1 malignantly transformed NIH3T3 cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CDC91L1 also resulted in upregulation of the urokinase receptor (uPAR), a GPI-anchored protein, and in turn increased STAT-3 phosphorylation in bladder cancer cells. Our findings suggest that CDC91L1 is an oncogene in bladder cancer, and implicate the GPI anchoring system as a potential oncogenic pathway and therapeutic target in human cancers.","Guo, Zhongmin;Linn, Jürgen F;Wu, Guojun;Anzick, Sarah L;Eisenberger, Claus F;Halachmi, Sarel;Cohen, Yoram;Fomenkov, Alexey;Hoque, Mohammad Obaidul;Okami, Kenji;Steiner, Gabriel;Engles, James M;Osada, Motonabu;Moon, Chulso;Ratovitski, Edward;Trent, Jeffrey M;Meltzer, Paul S;Westra, William H;Kiemeney, Lambertus A;Schoenberg, Mark P;Sidransky, David;Trink, Barry"
14981514,2004,Nature medicine,Bystander elimination of antigen loss variants in established tumors.,"Cancers express antigens that are targets for specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, cancer cells are genetically unstable. Consequently, sub-populations of cancer cells that no longer express the target antigen may escape destruction by CTLs and grow progressively. We show that cytotoxic T cells indirectly eliminate these antigen loss variants (ALVs) in a model system when the parental cancer cells express sufficient antigen to be effectively cross-presented by the tumor stroma. When the parental tumor expressed lower levels of antigen, cytotoxic T cells eradicated the antigen-positive parental cancer cells, but the ALVs escaped, grew and killed the host. By contrast, when the parental tumor expressed higher levels of antigen, cytotoxic T cells eradicated not only the parental cancer cells but also the ALVs. This 'bystander' elimination of ALVs required stromal cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules capable of presenting the antigen, and occurred in tumors showing evidence of stromal destruction. ALVs were apparently eliminated indirectly when tumor-specific CTLs killed stromal cells that were cross-presenting antigen produced by and released from antigen-positive cancer cells. These results highlight the general importance of targeting the tumor stroma to prevent the escape of variant cancer cells.","Spiotto, Michael T;Rowley, Donald A;Schreiber, Hans"

14704791,2004,Nature medicine,The membrane-cytoskeleton linker ezrin is necessary for osteosarcoma metastasis.,"Metastatic cancers, once established, are the primary cause of mortality associated with cancer. Previously, we used a genomic approach to identify metastasis-associated genes in cancer. From this genomic data, we selected ezrin for further study based on its role in physically and functionally connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. In a mouse model of osteosarcoma, a highly metastatic pediatric cancer, we found ezrin to be necessary for metastasis. By imaging metastatic cells in the lungs of mice, we showed that ezrin expression provided an early survival advantage for cancer cells that reached the lung. AKT and MAPK phosphorylation and activity were reduced when ezrin protein was suppressed. Ezrin-mediated early metastatic survival was partially dependent on activation of MAPK, but not AKT. To define the relevance of ezrin in the biology of metastasis, beyond the founding mouse model, we examined ezrin expression in dogs that naturally developed osteosarcoma. High ezrin expression in dog tumors was associated with early development of metastases. Consistent with this data, we found a significant association between high ezrin expression and poor outcome in pediatric osteosarcoma patients.","Khanna, Chand;Wan, Xiaolin;Bose, Seuli;Cassaday, Ryan;Olomu, Osarenoma;Mendoza, Arnulfo;Yeung, Choh;Gorlick, Richard;Hewitt, Stephen M;Helman, Lee J"
14704789,2004,Nature medicine,Expression profiling identifies the cytoskeletal organizer ezrin and the developmental homeoprotein Six-1 as key metastatic regulators.,"Patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children, have a very poor clinical prognosis. This is due, in large part, to our rudimentary knowledge of the molecular events that dictate metastatic potential. We used cDNA microarray analysis of RMS cell lines, derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), to identify a set of genes whose expression was significantly different between highly and poorly metastatic cells. Subsequent in vivo functional studies revealed that the actin filament-plasma membrane linker ezrin (encoded by Vil2) and the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Six-1 (sine oculis-related homeobox-1 homolog) had essential roles in determining the metastatic fate of RMS cells. VIL2 and SIX1 expression was enhanced in human RMS tissue, significantly correlating with clinical stage. The identification of ezrin and Six-1 as critical regulators of metastasis in RMS provides new mechanistic and therapeutic insights into this pediatric cancer.","Yu, Yanlin;Khan, Javed;Khanna, Chand;Helman, Lee;Meltzer, Paul S;Merlino, Glenn"
14702634,2004,Nature medicine,Regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses by Stat-3 signaling in tumor cells.,"Although tumor progression involves processes such as tissue invasion that can activate inflammatory responses, the immune system largely ignores or tolerates disseminated cancers. The mechanisms that block initiation of immune responses during cancer development are poorly understood. We report here that constitutive activation of Stat-3, a common oncogenic signaling pathway, suppresses tumor expression of proinflammatory mediators. Blocking Stat-3 in tumor cells increases expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that activate innate immunity and dendritic cells, leading to tumor-specific T-cell responses. In addition, constitutive Stat-3 activity induces production of pleiotropic factors that inhibit dendritic cell functional maturation. Tumor-derived factors inhibit dendritic cell maturation through Stat-3 activation in progenitor cells. Thus, inhibition of antitumor immunity involves a cascade of Stat-3 activation propagating from tumor to dendritic cells. We propose that tumor Stat-3 activity can mediate immune evasion by blocking both the production and sensing of inflammatory signals by multiple components of the immune system.","Wang, Tianhong;Niu, Guilian;Kortylewski, Marcin;Burdelya, Lyudmila;Shain, Kenneth;Zhang, Shumin;Bhattacharya, Raka;Gabrilovich, Dmitry;Heller, Richard;Coppola, Domenico;Dalton, William;Jove, Richard;Pardoll, Drew;Yu, Hua"
14702633,2004,Nature medicine,Suppression of breast cancer by chemical modulation of vulnerable zinc fingers in estrogen receptor.,"Current antiestrogen therapy for breast cancer is limited by the mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity of selective estrogen receptor modulators. Here we show that the function of zinc fingers in the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain (DBD) is susceptible to chemical inhibition by electrophilic disulfide benzamide and benzisothiazolone derivatives, which selectively block binding of the estrogen receptor to its responsive element and subsequent transcription. These compounds also significantly inhibit estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation, markedly reduce tumor mass in nude mice bearing human MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts, and interfere with cell-cycle and apoptosis regulatory gene expression. Functional assays and computational analysis support a molecular mechanism whereby electrophilic agents preferentially disrupt the vulnerable C-terminal zinc finger, thus suppressing estrogen receptor-mediated breast carcinoma progression. Our results provide the proof of principle for a new strategy to inhibit breast cancer at the level of DNA binding, rather than the classical antagonism of estrogen binding.","Wang, Li Hua;Yang, Xiao Yi;Zhang, Xiaohu;Mihalic, Kelly;Fan, Ying-Xin;Xiao, Weihua;Howard, O M Zack;Appella, Ettore;Maynard, Andrew T;Farrar, William L"
14702632,2004,Nature medicine,Molecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy.,"Using microarray-based profiling of isogenic prostate cancer xenograft models, we found that a modest increase in androgen receptor mRNA was the only change consistently associated with the development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy. This increase in androgen receptor mRNA and protein was both necessary and sufficient to convert prostate cancer growth from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory stage, and was dependent on a functional ligand-binding domain. Androgen receptor antagonists showed agonistic activity in cells with increased androgen receptor levels; this antagonist-agonist conversion was associated with alterations in the recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to the promoters of androgen receptor target genes. Increased levels of androgen receptor confer resistance to antiandrogens by amplifying signal output from low levels of residual ligand, and by altering the normal response to antagonists. These findings provide insight toward the design of new antiandrogens.","Chen, Charlie D;Welsbie, Derek S;Tran, Chris;Baek, Sung Hee;Chen, Randy;Vessella, Robert;Rosenfeld, Michael G;Sawyers, Charles L"
14566333,2003,Nature medicine,PML-RARA-targeted DNA vaccine induces protective immunity in a mouse model of leukemia.,"Despite improved molecular characterization of malignancies and development of targeted therapies, acute leukemia is not curable and few patients survive more than 10 years after diagnosis. Recently, combinations of different therapeutic strategies (based on mechanisms of apoptosis, differentiation and cytotoxicity) have significantly increased survival. To further improve outcome, we studied the potential efficacy of boosting the patient's immune response using specific immunotherapy. In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARA) oncogene to tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. We show for the first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and when combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage is concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We also show that ATRA therapy on its own triggers an immune response in this model. When DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy are combined, they induce protective immune responses against leukemia progression in mice and may provide a new approach to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.","Padua, Rose Ann;Larghero, Jerome;Robin, Marie;le Pogam, Carol;Schlageter, Marie-Helene;Muszlak, Sacha;Fric, Jan;West, Robert;Rousselot, Philippe;Phan, Thi Hai;Mudde, Liesbeth;Teisserenc, Helene;Carpentier, Antoine F;Kogan, Scott;Degos, Laurent;Pla, Marika;Bishop, J Michael;Stevenson, Freda;Charron, Dominique;Chomienne, Christine"

We show that tumor-cytolytic T cells are indeed elicited in patients after cancer vaccination, and that tumor reactivity is strongly correlated with efficient T-cell recognition of peptide-bearing targets. We combined CD107a mobilization with peptide-major histocompatibility complex (P-MHC) tetramer staining to directly correlate antigen specificity and cytolytic ability on a single-cell level. This showed that tumor-cytolytic T cells with high recognition efficiency represent only a minority of peptide-specific T cells elicited in patients after heteroclitic peptide vaccination. We were also able to expand these cells to high numbers ex vivo while maintaining their cytolytic potential. These techniques will be useful not only for immune monitoring of cancer vaccine trials, but also for adoptive cellular immunotherapy after ex vivo expansion. The ability to rapidly identify and isolate tumor-cytolytic T cells would be very useful in cancer immunotherapy.","Rubio, Valerie;Stuge, Tor B;Singh, Naileshni;Betts, Michael R;Weber, Jeffrey S;Roederer, Mario;Lee, Peter P"
14502284,2003,Nature medicine,Monitoring photodynamic therapy of solid tumors online by BOLD-contrast MRI.,"Antivascular photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors with palladium-bacteriopheophorbide (TOOKAD) relies on in situ photosensitization of the circulating drug by local generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, which leads to rapid vascular occlusion, stasis, necrosis and tumor eradication. Intravascular production of reactive oxygen species is associated with photoconsumption of O(2) and consequent evolution of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin. In this study we evaluate the use of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for real-time monitoring of PDT efficacy. Using a solid tumor model, we show that TOOKAD-PDT generates appreciable attenuation (25-40%) of the magnetic resonance signal, solely at the illuminated tumor site. This phenomenon is independent of, though augmented by, ensuing changes in blood flow. These results were validated by immunohistochemistry and intravital microscopy. The concept of photosensitized BOLD-contrast MRI may have intraoperative applications in interactive guidance and monitoring of antivascular cancer therapy, PDT treatment of macular degeneration, interventional cardiology and possibly other biomedical disciplines.","Gross, Shimon;Gilead, Assaf;Scherz, Avigdor;Neeman, Michal;Salomon, Yoram"

Here we show that most human tumors constitutively express IDO. We also observed that expression of IDO by immunogenic mouse tumor cells prevents their rejection by preimmunized mice. This effect is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of specific T cells at the tumor site and can be partly reverted by systemic treatment of mice with an inhibitor of IDO, in the absence of noticeable toxicity. These results suggest that the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients might be improved by concomitant administration of an IDO inhibitor.","Uyttenhove, Catherine;Pilotte, Luc;Théate, Ivan;Stroobant, Vincent;Colau, Didier;Parmentier, Nicolas;Boon, Thierry;Van den Eynde, Benoît J"

12897778,2003,Nature medicine,Interaction between leukemic-cell VLA-4 and stromal fibronectin is a decisive factor for minimal residual disease of acute myelogenous leukemia.,"Bone-marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) causes relapse after chemotherapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We postulate that the drug resistance is induced by the attachment of very late antigen (VLA)-4 on leukemic cells to fibronectin on bone-marrow stromal cells. We found that VLA-4-positive cells acquired resistance to anoikis (loss of anchorage) or drug-induced apoptosis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway, which is activated by the interaction of VLA-4 and fibronectin. This resistance was negated by VLA-4-specific antibodies. In a mouse model of MRD, we achieved a 100% survival rate by combining VLA-4-specific antibodies and cytosine arabinoside (AraC), whereas AraC alone prolonged survival only slightly. In addition, overall survival at 5 years was 100% for 10 VLA-4-negative patients and 44.4% for 15 VLA-4-positive patients. Thus, the interaction between VLA-4 on leukemic cells and fibronectin on stromal cells may be crucial in bone marrow MRD and AML prognosis.","Matsunaga, Takuya;Takemoto, Naofumi;Sato, Tsutomu;Takimoto, Rishu;Tanaka, Ikuta;Fujimi, Akihito;Akiyama, Takehide;Kuroda, Hiroyuki;Kawano, Yutaka;Kobune, Masayoshi;Kato, Junji;Hirayama, Yasuo;Sakamaki, Sumio;Kohda, Kyuhei;Miyake, Kensuke;Niitsu, Yoshiro"
12872165,2003,Nature medicine,Transcription factor Egr-1 supports FGF-dependent angiogenesis during neovascularization and tumor growth.,"Current understanding of key transcription factors regulating angiogenesis is limited. Here we show that RNA-cleaving phosphodiester-linked DNA-based enzymes (DNAzymes), targeting a specific motif in the 5' untranslated region of early growth response (Egr-1) mRNA, inhibit Egr-1 protein expression, microvascular endothelial cell replication and migration, and microtubule network formation on basement membrane matrices. Egr-1 DNAzymes blocked angiogenesis in subcutaneous Matrigel plugs in mice, an observation that was independently confirmed by plug analysis in Egr-1-deficient animals, and inhibited MCF-7 human breast carcinoma growth in nude mice. Egr-1 DNAzymes suppressed tumor growth without influencing body weight, wound healing, blood coagulation or other hematological parameters. These agents inhibited endothelial expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, a proangiogenic factor downstream of Egr-1, but not that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Egr-1 DNAzymes also repressed neovascularization of rat cornea. Thus, microvascular endothelial cell growth, neovascularization, tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth are processes that are critically dependent on Egr-1.","Fahmy, Roger G;Dass, Crispin R;Sun, Lun-Quan;Chesterman, Colin N;Khachigian, Levon M"
12872164,2003,Nature medicine,BMP-2 mediates retinoid-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma cells through a paracrine effect.,"The mechanisms of retinoid activity in tumors remain largely unknown. Here we establish that retinoids cause extensive apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells. In a xenograft model, retinoids largely abrogated tumor growth. Using receptor-specific retinoid agonists, we defined a subset of mRNAs that were induced by all active retinoids in retinoid-sensitive cell lines. We also identified bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) as a candidate mediator of retinoid activity. BMP-2 protein induced medulloblastoma cell apoptosis, whereas the BMP-2 antagonist noggin blocked both retinoid and BMP-2-induced apoptosis. BMP-2 also induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is necessary for BMP-2- and retinoid-induced apoptosis. Retinoid-resistant medulloblastoma cells underwent apoptosis when treated with BMP-2 or when cultured with retinoid-sensitive medulloblastoma cells. Retinoid-induced expression of BMP-2 is thus necessary and sufficient for apoptosis of retinoid-responsive cells, and expression of BMP-2 by retinoid-sensitive cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis in surrounding retinoid-resistant cells.","Hallahan, Andrew R;Pritchard, Joel I;Chandraratna, Roshantha A S;Ellenbogen, Richard G;Geyer, J Russel;Overland, Ryan P;Strand, Andrew D;Tapscott, Stephen J;Olson, James M"
12778137,2003,Nature medicine,Immunotherapy of established tumors using bone marrow transplantation with antigen gene--modified hematopoietic stem cells.,"A major focus of cancer immunotherapy is to develop strategies to induce T-cell responses through presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs). Current vaccines are limited in their ability to efficiently transfer antigens to DCs in vivo. Ex vivo-generated DCs can be efficiently loaded with antigen but after reinjection, few DCs traffic to secondary lymphoid organs, the critical sites for antigen presentation. To enhance efficiency and durability of antigen presentation by DCs, we transduced hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSCs) with a model tumor antigen and then transplanted the gene-modified cells into irradiated recipient mice, which resulted in efficient expression of the transgene in a large proportion of donor derived DCs in lymphoid organs. The combination of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using transduced HSCs, systemic agents that generate and activate DCs, and mature T-cell infusion resulted in substantial expansion and activation of antigen-specific T cells. This tripartite strategy provided potent antigen-specific immunotherapy for an aggressive established tumor.","Cui, Yan;Kelleher, Erin;Straley, Erin;Fuchs, Ephraim;Gorski, Kevin;Levitsky, Hyam;Borrello, Ivan;Civin, Curt I;Schoenberger, Stephen P;Cheng, Linzhao;Pardoll, Drew M;Whartenby, Katharine A"

Thus, simple histological staining of tumor tissue biopsies for collagen could be used to assess the accessibility of molecular therapeutics in tumors. Here we show that it is possible to optically image fibrillar collagen in tumors growing in mice using second-harmonic generation (SHG). Using this noninvasive technique, we estimated relative diffusive hindrance, quantified the dynamics of collagen modification after pharmacologic intervention and provided mechanistic insight into improved diffusive transport induced by the hormone relaxin.

12740570,2003,Nature medicine,Targeting exogenous genes to tumor angiogenesis by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells.,"Angiogenic tumor vessels are promising targets for the activity and the selective delivery of cancer therapeutics. The bone marrow contributes different cell types to the tumor stroma, including hematopoietic cells and, as recently suggested, vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Thus, transplantation of genetically modified bone marrow progenitors may represent a vehicle for the transport of gene therapy to tumors. We transduced bone marrow progenitors with lentiviral vectors expressing genes from transcription-regulatory elements of Tie2/Tek gene. When tumors were grown in the transplanted mice, the new vector marked a distinct hematopoietic population that 'homed' to the tumor and closely interacted with vascular ECs at the tumor periphery. These Tie2-expressing mononuclear (TEM) cells had a distinguishable phenotype and were present selectively at angiogenic sites. Unexpectedly, we did not find bone marrow-derived ECs in tumor vessels when we transplanted bone marrow progenitors constitutively expressing a marker gene from the Tie2 or ubiquitously active promoters. By delivering a 'suicide' gene, we selectively eliminated the TEM cells and achieved substantial inhibition of angiogenesis and slower tumor growth without systemic toxicity. Thus, TEM cells may account for the proangiogenic activity of bone marrow-derived cells in tumors, may represent a new target for drug development and may provide the means for selective gene delivery and targeted inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.","De Palma, Michele;Venneri, Mary Anna;Roca, Cristina;Naldini, Luigi"
12704383,2003,Nature medicine,Blockade of B7-H1 improves myeloid dendritic cell-mediated antitumor immunity.,"Suppression of dendritic cell function in cancer patients is thought to contribute to the inhibition of immune responses and disease progression. Molecular mechanisms of this suppression remain elusive, however. Here, we show that a fraction of blood monocyte-derived myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) express B7-H1, a member of the B7 family, on the cell surface. B7-H1 could be further upregulated by tumor environmental factors. Consistent with this finding, virtually all MDCs isolated from the tissues or draining lymph nodes of ovarian carcinomas express B7-H1. Blockade of B7-H1 enhanced MDC-mediated T-cell activation and was accompanied by downregulation of T-cell interleukin (IL)-10 and upregulation of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. T cells conditioned with the B7-H1-blocked MDCs had a more potent ability to inhibit autologous human ovarian carcinoma growth in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Therefore, upregulation of B7-H1 on MDCs in the tumor microenvironment downregulates T-cell immunity. Blockade of B7-H1 represents one approach for cancer immunotherapy.","Curiel, Tyler J;Wei, Shuang;Dong, Haidong;Alvarez, Xavier;Cheng, Pui;Mottram, Peter;Krzysiek, Roman;Knutson, Keith L;Daniel, Ben;Zimmermann, Maria Carla;David, Odile;Burow, Matthew;Gordon, Alan;Dhurandhar, Nina;Myers, Leann;Berggren, Ruth;Hemminki, Akseli;Alvarez, Ronald D;Emilie, Dominique;Curiel, David T;Chen, Lieping;Zou, Weiping"

We studied whether HHV-8 and the elusive KS progenitor cells could be transmitted from the donor through the grafts. We used a variety of molecular, cytogenetic, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods to show that the HHV-8-infected neoplastic cells in post-transplant KS from five of eight renal transplant patients harbored either genetic or antigenic markers of their matched donors.

12692539,2003,Nature medicine,Disruption of the Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian tumors.,"Ovarian tumor cells are often genomically unstable and hypersensitive to cisplatin. To understand the molecular basis for this phenotype, we examined the integrity of the Fanconi anemia-BRCA (FANC-BRCA) pathway in those cells. This pathway regulates cisplatin sensitivity and is governed by the coordinate activity of six genes associated with Fanconi anemia (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF and FANCG) as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2 (FANCD1). Here we show that the FANC-BRCA pathway is disrupted in a subset of ovarian tumor lines. Mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, a measure of the function of this pathway, and cisplatin resistance were restored by functional complementation with FANCF, a gene that is upstream in this pathway. FANCF inactivation in ovarian tumors resulted from methylation of its CpG island, and acquired cisplatin resistance correlated with demethylation of FANCF. We propose a model for ovarian tumor progression in which the initial methylation of FANCF is followed by FANCF demethylation and ultimately results in cisplatin resistance.","Taniguchi, Toshiyasu;Tischkowitz, Marc;Ameziane, Najim;Hodgson, Shirley V;Mathew, Christopher G;Joenje, Hans;Mok, Samuel C;D'Andrea, Alan D"
12640447,2003,Nature medicine,Predicting hepatitis B virus-positive metastatic hepatocellular carcinomas using gene expression profiling and supervised machine learning.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive human malignancies. Its high mortality rate is mainly a result of intra-hepatic metastases. We analyzed the expression profiles of HCC samples without or with intra-hepatic metastases. Using a supervised machine-learning algorithm, we generated for the first time a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients and identified genes that were relevant to metastasis and patient survival. We found that the gene expression signature of primary HCCs with accompanying metastasis was very similar to that of their corresponding metastases, implying that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. Osteopontin, which was identified as a lead gene in the signature, was over-expressed in metastatic HCC; an osteopontin-specific antibody effectively blocked HCC cell invasion in vitro and inhibited pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells in nude mice. Thus, osteopontin acts as both a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.","Ye, Qing-Hai;Qin, Lun-Xiu;Forgues, Marshonna;He, Ping;Kim, Jin Woo;Peng, Amy C;Simon, Richard;Li, Yan;Robles, Ana I;Chen, Yidong;Ma, Zeng-Chen;Wu, Zhi-Quan;Ye, Sheng-Long;Liu, Yin-Kun;Tang, Zhao-You;Wang, Xin Wei"
12579196,2003,Nature medicine,Eradication of systemic B-cell tumors by genetically targeted human T lymphocytes co-stimulated by CD80 and interleukin-15.,"The genetic transfer of antigen receptors provides a means to rapidly generate autologous tumor-reactive T lymphocytes. However, recognition of tumor antigens by cytotoxic T cells is only one step towards effective cancer immunotherapy. Other crucial biological prerequisites must be fulfilled to expand tumor-reactive T cells that retain a functional phenotype, including in vivo cytolytic activity and the ability to travel to tumor sites without prematurely succumbing to apoptosis. We show that these requirements are met by expanding peripheral blood T cells genetically targeted to the CD19 antigen in the presence of CD80 and interleukin-15 (IL-15). T cells expanded in the presence of IL-15 uniquely persist in tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-Beige mice and eradicate disseminated intramedullary tumors. Their anti-tumor activity is further enhanced by in vivo co-stimulation. In addition, transduced T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) effectively lyse autologous tumor cells. These findings strongly support the clinical feasibility of this therapeutic strategy.","Brentjens, Renier J;Latouche, Jean-Baptiste;Santos, Elmer;Marti, Francesc;Gong, Michael C;Lyddane, Clay;King, Philip D;Larson, Steven;Weiss, Mark;Rivière, Isabelle;Sadelain, Michel"
12496961,2003,Nature medicine,Alphavirus-based DNA vaccine breaks immunological tolerance by activating innate antiviral pathways.,"Cancer vaccines targeting 'self' antigens that are expressed at consistently high levels by tumor cells are potentially useful in immunotherapy, but immunological tolerance may block their function. Here, we describe a novel, naked DNA vaccine encoding an alphavirus replicon (self-replicating mRNA) and the self/tumor antigen tyrosinase-related protein-1. Unlike conventional DNA vaccines, this vaccine can break tolerance and provide immunity to melanoma. The vaccine mediates production of double-stranded RNA, as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR). Double-stranded RNA is critical to vaccine function because both the immunogenicity and the anti-tumor activity of the vaccine are blocked in mice deficient for the RNase L enzyme, a key component of the 2',5'-linked oligoadenylate synthetase antiviral pathway involved in double-stranded RNA recognition. This study shows for the first time that alphaviral replicon-encoding DNA vaccines activate innate immune pathways known to drive antiviral immune responses, and points the way to strategies for improving the efficacy of immunization with naked DNA.","Leitner, Wolfgang W;Hwang, Leroy N;deVeer, Michael J;Zhou, Aimin;Silverman, Robert H;Williams, Bryan R G;Dubensky, Thomas W;Ying, Han;Restifo, Nicholas P"
12415261,2002,Nature medicine,A DNA vaccine against VEGF receptor 2 prevents effective angiogenesis and inhibits tumor growth.,"Tumor cells are elusive targets for immunotherapy due to their heterogeneity and genetic instability. Here we describe a novel, oral DNA vaccine that targets stable, proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature rather than tumor cells. Targeting occurs through upregulated vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (FLK-1) of proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature. This vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal challenges with melanoma, colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells and reduced growth of established metastases in a therapeutic setting. CTL-mediated killing of endothelial cells indicated breaking of peripheral immune tolerance against this self antigen, resulting in markedly reduced dissemination of spontaneous and experimental pulmonary metastases. Angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature was suppressed without impairment of fertility, neuromuscular performance or hematopoiesis, albeit with a slight delay in wound healing. Our strategy circumvents problems in targeting of genetically unstable tumor cells. This approach may provide a new strategy for the rational design of cancer therapies.","Niethammer, Andreas G;Xiang, Rong;Becker, Jürgen C;Wodrich, Harald;Pertl, Ursula;Karsten, Gabriele;Eliceiri, Brian P;Reisfeld, Ralph A"

No suitable drug therapies are currently available, and surgical excision is not invariably curative. Here we demonstrate immunoreactive expression of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) exclusively in normal ACTH-secreting human anterior pituitary cells: PPAR-gamma was abundantly expressed in all of six human ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors studied. PPAR-gamma activators induced G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis and suppressed ACTH secretion in human and murine corticotroph tumor cells. Development of murine corticotroph tumors, generated by subcutaneous injection of ACTH-secreting AtT20 cells, was prevented in four of five mice treated with the thiazolidinedione compound rosiglitazone, and ACTH and corticosterone secretion was suppressed in all treated mice.

For the molecules and pathways that have been implicated, genetic validation has been impeded by lack of a mouse model of RMS. Here we show that simultaneous loss of Ink4a/Arf function and disruption of c-Met signaling in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) induces RMS with extremely high penetrance and short latency. In cultured myoblasts, c-Met activation and Ink4a/Arf loss suppress myogenesis in an additive fashion. Our data indicate that human c-MET and INK4a/ARF, situated at the nexus of pathways regulating myogenic growth and differentiation, represent critical targets in RMS pathogenesis. The marked synergism in mice between aberrant c-Met signaling and Ink4a/Arf inactivation, lesions individually implicated in human RMS, suggests a therapeutic combination to combat this devastating childhood cancer.","Sharp, Richard;Recio, Juan A;Jhappan, Chamelli;Otsuka, Toshiyuki;Liu, Shiquan;Yu, Yanlin;Liu, Wenjing;Anver, Miriam;Navid, Fariba;Helman, Lee J;DePinho, Ronald A;Merlino, Glenn"
12244303,2002,Nature medicine,Cytoplasmic relocalization and inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) by PKB/Akt-mediated phosphorylation in breast cancer.,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) is a putative tumor suppressor for human cancer. The mechanism underlying p27(kip1) deregulation in human cancer is, however, poorly understood. We demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase Akt regulates cell proliferation in breast cancer cells by preventing p27(kip1)-mediated growth arrest. Threonine 157 (T157), which maps within the nuclear localization signal of p27(kip1), is a predicted Akt-phosphorylation site. Akt-induced T157 phosphorylation causes retention of p27(kip1) in the cytoplasm, precluding p27(kip1)-induced G1 arrest. Conversely, the p27(kip1)-T157A mutant accumulates in cell nuclei and Akt does not affect p27(kip1)-T157A-mediated cell cycle arrest. Lastly, T157-phosphorylated p27(kip1) accumulates in the cytoplasm of primary human breast cancer cells coincident with Akt activation. Thus, cytoplasmic relocalization of p27(kip1), secondary to Akt-mediated phosphorylation, is a novel mechanism whereby the growth inhibitory properties of p27(kip1) are functionally inactivated and the proliferation of breast cancer cells is sustained.","Viglietto, Giuseppe;Motti, Maria Letizia;Bruni, Paola;Melillo, Rosa Marina;D'Alessio, Amelia;Califano, Daniela;Vinci, Floriana;Chiappetta, Gennaro;Tsichlis, Philip;Bellacosa, Alfonso;Fusco, Alfredo;Santoro, Massimo"
12219084,2002,Nature medicine,Epstein-Barr virus-associated Burkitt lymphomagenesis selects for downregulation of the nuclear antigen EBNA2.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL), but its contribution to lymphomagenesis, versus that of the chromosomal translocation leading to c-myc gene deregulation, remains unclear. The virus's growth-transforming (Latency III) program of gene expression is extinguished in tumor cells, and only a single viral protein, the EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)1, is expressed via the alternative Latency I program. It is not known if BL arises from a B-cell subset in which EBV naturally adopts a Latency I infection or if a clone with limited antigen expression has been selected from an EBV-transformed Latency III progenitor pool. Here we identify a subset of BL tumors in which the Latency III-associated EBNA promoter Wp is active and most EBNAs are expressed, but where a gene deletion has specifically abrogated the expression of EBNA2. This implies that BL can be selected from a Latency III progenitor and that the principal selection pressure is for downregulation of the c-Myc antagonist EBNA2.","Kelly, Gemma;Bell, Andrew;Rickinson, Alan"

However, the role of wild-type Notch signaling in neoplastic transformation remains unclear. Ras signaling is deregulated in a large fraction of human malignancies and is a major target for the development of novel cancer treatments. We show that oncogenic Ras activates Notch signaling and that wild-type Notch-1 is necessary to maintain the neoplastic phenotype in Ras-transformed human cells in vitro and in vivo. Oncogenic Ras increases levels and activity of the intracellular form of wild-type Notch-1, and upregulates Notch ligand Delta-1 and also presenilin-1, a protein involved in Notch processing, through a p38-mediated pathway.

Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly migratory and invasive behavior, which makes surgical intervention unsuccessful. Here, we showed that glioblastoma cells express Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors assembled from the GluR1 and/or GluR4 subunits, and that their conversion to Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the GluR2 cDNA inhibited cell locomotion and induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors facilitated migration and proliferation of the tumor cells.

AdPSE-BC-luc, which expresses firefly luciferase from an enhanced prostate-specific antigen promoter, restricted expression in the liver but produced robust signals in prostate tumors. In fact, expression was higher in advanced, androgen-independent tumors than in androgen-dependent lesions. Repetitive imaging over a three-week period after AdPSE-BC-luc injection into tumor-bearing mice revealed that the virus could locate and illuminate metastases in the lung and spine. Systemic injection of low doses of AdPSE-BC-luc illuminated lung metastasis.

Here, we report that transfer of the gene encoding second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) or Smac peptides sensitized various tumor cells in vitro and malignant glioma cells in vivo for apoptosis induced by death-receptor ligation or cytotoxic drugs. Expression of a cytosolic active form of Smac or cell-permeable Smac peptides bypassed the Bcl-2 block, which prevented the release of Smac from mitochondria, and also sensitized resistant neuroblastoma or melanoma cells and patient-derived primary neuroblastoma cells ex vivo. Most importantly, Smac peptides strongly enhanced the antitumor activity of Apo-2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in an intracranial malignant glioma xenograft model in vivo. Complete eradication of established tumors and survival of mice was only achieved upon combined treatment with Smac peptides and Apo2L/TRAIL without detectable toxicity to normal brain tissue. Thus, Smac agonists are promising candidates for cancer therapy by potentiating cytotoxic therapies.","Fulda, Simone;Wick, Wolfgang;Weller, Michael;Debatin, Klaus-Michael"

Genes most related to survival were identified with univariate Cox analysis. Using either two equivalent but independent training and testing sets, or 'leave-one-out' cross-validation analysis with all tumors, a risk index based on the top 50 genes identified low-risk and high-risk stage I lung adenocarcinomas, which differed significantly with respect to survival. This risk index was then validated using an independent sample of lung adenocarcinomas that predicted high- and low-risk groups. This index included genes not previously associated with survival.

12091906,2002,Nature medicine,"The t(8;21) fusion protein, AML1 ETO, specifically represses the transcription of the p14(ARF) tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia.","The t(8;21) is one of the most frequent chromosomal translocations associated with acute leukemia. This translocation creates a fusion protein consisting of the acute myeloid leukemia-1 transcription factor and the eight-twenty-one corepressor (AML1 ETO), which represses transcription through AML1 (RUNX1) DNA binding sites and immortalizes hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have identified the p14(ARF) tumor suppressor, a mediator of the p53 oncogene checkpoint, as a direct transcriptional target of AML1 ETO. AML1 ETO repressed the p14(ARF) promoter and reduced endogenous levels of p14(ARF) expression in multiple cell types. In contrast, AML1 stimulated p14(ARF) expression and induced phenotypes consistent with cellular senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AML1 ETO was specifically bound to the p14(ARF) promoter. In acute myeloid leukemia samples containing the t(8;21), levels of p14(ARF) mRNA were markedly lower when compared with other acute myeloid leukemias lacking this translocation. Repression of p14(ARF) may explain why p53 is not mutated in t(8;21)-containing leukemias and suggests that p14(ARF) is an important tumor suppressor in a large number of human leukemias.","Linggi, Bryan;Müller-Tidow, Carsten;van de Locht, Louis;Hu, Ming;Nip, John;Serve, Hubert;Berdel, Wolfgang E;van der Reijden, Bert;Quelle, Dawn E;Rowley, Janet D;Cleveland, John;Jansen, Joop H;Pandolfi, Pier Paolo;Hiebert, Scott W"
12091876,2002,Nature medicine,Tumor-associated B7-H1 promotes T-cell apoptosis: a potential mechanism of immune evasion.,"B7-H1, a recently described member of the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is thought to be involved in the regulation of cellular and humoral immune responses through the PD-1 receptor on activated T and B cells. We report here that, except for cells of the macrophage lineage, normal human tissues do not express B7-H1. In contrast, B7-H1 is abundant in human carcinomas of lung, ovary and colon and in melanomas. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma upregulates B7-H1 on the surface of tumor cell lines. Cancer cell-associated B7-H1 increases apoptosis of antigen-specific human T-cell clones in vitro, and the apoptotic effect of B7-H1 is mediated largely by one or more receptors other than PD-1. In addition, expression of B7-H1 on mouse P815 tumor increases apoptosis of activated tumor-reactive T cells and promotes the growth of highly immunogenic B7-1(+) tumors in vivo. These findings have implications for the design of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.","Dong, Haidong;Strome, Scott E;Salomao, Diva R;Tamura, Hideto;Hirano, Fumiya;Flies, Dallas B;Roche, Patrick C;Lu, Jun;Zhu, Gefeng;Tamada, Koji;Lennon, Vanda A;Celis, Esteban;Chen, Lieping"
12053175,2002,Nature medicine,A tumor-homing peptide with a targeting specificity related to lymphatic vessels.,"Blood vessels of tumors carry specific markers that are usually angiogenesis-related. We previously used phage-displayed peptide libraries in vivo to identify peptides that home to tumors through the circulation and that specifically bind to the endothelia of tumor blood vessels. Here we devised a phage screening procedure that would favor tumor-homing to targets that are accessible to circulating phage, but are not blood vessels. Screening on MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma xenografts yielded multiple copies of a phage that displays a cyclic 9-amino-acid peptide, LyP-1. Homing and binding to tumor-derived cell suspensions indicated that LyP-1 also recognizes an osteosarcoma xenograft, and spontaneous prostate and breast cancers in transgenic mice, but not two other tumor xenografts. Fluorescein-labeled LyP-1 peptide was detected in tumor structures that were positive for three lymphatic endothelial markers and negative for three blood vessel markers. LyP-1 accumulated in the nuclei of the putative lymphatic cells, and in the nuclei of tumor cells. These results suggest that tumor lymphatics carry specific markers and that it may be possible to specifically target therapies into tumor lymphatics.","Laakkonen, Pirjo;Porkka, Kimmo;Hoffman, Jason A;Ruoslahti, Erkki"
11875501,2002,Nature medicine,Prostaglandin E2 transactivates EGF receptor: a novel mechanism for promoting colon cancer growth and gastrointestinal hypertrophy.,"Prostaglandins (PGs), bioactive lipid molecules produced by cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), have diverse biological activities, including growth-promoting actions on gastrointestinal mucosa. They are also implicated in the growth of colonic polyps and cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of these trophic actions of PGs remain unclear. As activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) triggers mitogenic signaling in gastrointestinal mucosa, and its expression is also upregulated in colonic cancers and most neoplasms, we investigated whether PGs transactivate EGFR. Here we provide evidence that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly phosphorylates EGFR and triggers the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)--mitogenic signaling pathway in normal gastric epithelial (RGM1) and colon cancer (Caco-2, LoVo and HT-29) cell lines. Inactivation of EGFR kinase with selective inhibitors significantly reduces PGE2-induced ERK2 activation, c-fos mRNA expression and cell proliferation. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) or c-Src blocked PGE2-mediated EGFR transactivation and downstream signaling indicating that PGE2-induced EGFR transactivation involves signaling transduced via TGF-alpha, an EGFR ligand, likely released by c-Src-activated MMP(s). Our findings that PGE2 transactivates EGFR reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which PGE2 mediates trophic actions resulting in gastric and intestinal hypertrophy as well as growth of colonic polyps and cancers.","Pai, Rama;Soreghan, Brian;Szabo, Imre L;Pavelka, Meredith;Baatar, Dolgor;Tarnawski, Andrzej S"
11875492,2002,Nature medicine,HIV protease inhibitors are potent anti-angiogenic molecules and promote regression of Kaposi sarcoma.,"Treatment with HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI) is associated with a reduced incidence or regression of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Here we show that systemic administration of the PIs indinavir or saquinavir to nude mice blocks the development and induces regression of angioproliferative KS-like lesions promoted by primary human KS cells, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combined. These PIs also block bFGF or VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay with a potency similar to paclitaxel (Taxol). These effects are mediated by the inhibition of endothelial- and KS-cell invasion and of matrix metalloproteinase-2 proteolytic activation by PIs at concentrations present in plasma of treated individuals. As PIs also inhibit the in vivo growth and invasion of an angiogenic tumor-cell line, these data indicate that PIs are potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor molecules that might be used in treating non-HIV KS and in other HIV-associated tumors.","Sgadari, Cecilia;Barillari, Giovanni;Toschi, Elena;Carlei, Davide;Bacigalupo, Ilaria;Baccarini, Sara;Palladino, Clelia;Leone, Patrizia;Bugarini, Roberto;Malavasi, Laura;Cafaro, Aurelio;Falchi, Mario;Valdembri, Donatella;Rezza, Giovanni;Bussolino, Federico;Monini, Paolo;Ensoli, Barbara"
11821896,2002,Nature medicine,Rapamycin inhibits primary and metastatic tumor growth by antiangiogenesis: involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor.,"Conventional immunosuppressive drugs have been used effectively to prevent immunologic rejection in organ transplantation. Individuals taking these drugs are at risk, however, for the development and recurrence of cancer. In the present study we show that the new immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RAPA) may reduce the risk of cancer development while simultaneously providing effective immunosuppression. Experimentally, RAPA inhibited metastatic tumor growth and angiogenesis in in vivo mouse models. In addition, normal immunosuppressive doses of RAPA effectively controlled the growth of established tumors. In contrast, the most widely recognized immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine, promoted tumor growth. From a mechanistic perspective, RAPA showed antiangiogenic activities linked to a decrease in production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and to a markedly inhibited response of vascular endothelial cells to stimulation by VEGF. Thus, the use of RAPA, instead of cyclosporine, may reduce the chance of recurrent or de novo cancer in high-risk transplant patients.","Guba, Markus;von Breitenbuch, Philipp;Steinbauer, Markus;Koehl, Gudrun;Flegel, Stefanie;Hornung, Matthias;Bruns, Christiane J;Zuelke, Carl;Farkas, Stefan;Anthuber, Matthias;Jauch, Karl-Walter;Geissler, Edward K"
11786911,2002,Nature medicine,Nanocapsules: lipid-coated aggregates of cisplatin with high cytotoxicity.,"Cisplatin is one of the most widely used agents in the treatment of solid tumors, but its clinical utility is limited by toxicity. The development of less toxic, liposomal formulations of cisplatin has been hampered by the low water solubility and low lipophilicity of cisplatin, resulting in very low encapsulation efficiencies. We describe a novel method allowing the efficient encapsulation of cisplatin in a lipid formulation; it is based on repeated freezing and thawing of a concentrated solution of cisplatin in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. The method is unique in that it generates nanocapsules, which are small aggregates of cisplatin covered by a single lipid bilayer. The nanocapsules have an unprecedented drug-to-lipid ratio and an in vitro cytotoxicity up to 1000-fold higher than the free drug. Analysis of the mechanism of nanocapsule formation suggests that the method may be generalized to other drugs showing low water solubility and lipophilicity.","Burger, Koert N J;Staffhorst, Rutger W H M;de Vijlder, Hanke C;Velinova, Maria J;Bomans, Paul H;Frederik, Peter M;de Kruijff, Ben"

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70% versus 12%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.","Shipp, Margaret A;Ross, Ken N;Tamayo, Pablo;Weng, Andrew P;Kutok, Jeffery L;Aguiar, Ricardo C T;Gaasenbeek, Michelle;Angelo, Michael;Reich, Michael;Pinkus, Geraldine S;Ray, Tane S;Koval, Margaret A;Last, Kim W;Norton, Andrew;Lister, T Andrew;Mesirov, Jill;Neuberg, Donna S;Lander, Eric S;Aster, Jon C;Golub, Todd R"
11726975,2001,Nature medicine,Stromal-derived factor-1 in human tumors recruits and alters the function of plasmacytoid precursor dendritic cells.,"Dendritic-cell (DC) trafficking and function in tumors is poorly characterized, with studies confined to myeloid DCs (DC1s). Tumors inhibit DC1 migration and function, likely hindering specific immunity. The role of plasmacytoid DCs (DC2s) in tumor immunity is unknown. We show here that malignant human ovarian epithelial tumor cells express very high levels of stromal-derived factor-1, which induces DC2 precursor (preDC2) chemotaxis and adhesion/transmigration, upregulates preDC2 very late antigen (VLA)-5, and protects preDC2s from tumor macrophage interleukin-10-induced apoptosis, all through CXC chemokine receptor-4. The VLA-5 ligand vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 mediated preDC2 adhesion/transmigration. Tumor preDC2s induced significant T-cell interleukin-10 unrelated to preDC2 differentiation or activation state, and this contributed to poor T-cell activation. Myeloid precursor DCs (preDC1s) were not detected. Tumors may weaken immunity by attracting preDC2s and protecting them from the harsh microenvironment, and by altering preDC1 distribution.","Zou, W;Machelon, V;Coulomb-L'Hermin, A;Borvak, J;Nome, F;Isaeva, T;Wei, S;Krzysiek, R;Durand-Gasselin, I;Gordon, A;Pustilnik, T;Curiel, D T;Galanaud, P;Capron, F;Emilie, D;Curiel, T J"
11689883,2001,Nature medicine,Impaired recruitment of bone-marrow-derived endothelial and hematopoietic precursor cells blocks tumor angiogenesis and growth.,"The role of bone marrow (BM)-derived precursor cells in tumor angiogenesis is not known. We demonstrate here that tumor angiogenesis is associated with recruitment of hematopoietic and circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEPs). We used the angiogenic defective, tumor resistant Id-mutant mice to show that transplantation of wild-type BM or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mobilized stem cells restore tumor angiogenesis and growth. We detected donor-derived CEPs throughout the neovessels of tumors and Matrigel-plugs in an Id1+/-Id3-/- host, which were associated with VEGF-receptor-1-positive (VEGFR1+) myeloid cells. The angiogenic defect in Id-mutant mice was due to impaired VEGF-driven mobilization of VEGFR2+ CEPs and impaired proliferation and incorporation of VEGFR1+ cells. Although targeting of either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 alone partially blocks the growth of tumors, inhibition of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was necessary to completely ablate tumor growth. These data demonstrate that recruitment of VEGF-responsive BM-derived precursors is necessary and sufficient for tumor angiogenesis and suggest new clinical strategies to block tumor growth.","Lyden, D;Hattori, K;Dias, S;Costa, C;Blaikie, P;Butros, L;Chadburn, A;Heissig, B;Marks, W;Witte, L;Wu, Y;Hicklin, D;Zhu, Z;Hackett, N R;Crystal, R G;Moore, M A;Hajjar, K A;Manova, K;Benezra, R;Rafii, S"
11590442,2001,Nature medicine,Adoptive tumor therapy with T lymphocytes enriched through an IFN-gamma capture assay.,"Successful adoptive T-cell therapy has been demonstrated in viral disease and selected forms of cancer. However, it is limited by the difficulty to efficiently isolate and amplify autologous tumor-reactive T-cell clones. Tetramers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and peptide have facilitated the characterization of CD8+ T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens. However, for adoptive T-cell therapy, MHC-tetramers have limitations: they require knowledge of tumor antigens, which is often not available; they select T cells with a single specificity, thereby posing risk for selection of tumor escape variants; they do not select for function, so that T cells may be anergic when isolated from cancer patients; and they do not allow the isolation of CD4+ T cells that can be essential for tumor rejection. Because interferon (IFN)-gamma is essential for tumor rejection, we isolated live T cells based on their IFN-gamma production. IFN-gamma secreted by previously activated T cells is retained on the cell surface, allowing their specific isolation and expansion. We show here that IFN-gamma+ but not IFN-gamma- T cells from tumor-immunized mice are cytolytic and mediate tumor rejection upon adoptive transfer. Importantly, tumor-specific T cells can be enriched from lymphocytes infiltrating human renal cell carcinoma by the IFN-gamma capture assay.","Becker, C;Pohla, H;Frankenberger, B;Schüler, T;Assenmacher, M;Schendel, D J;Blankenstein, T"
11590434,2001,Nature medicine,Immune-mediated eradication of tumors through the blockade of transforming growth factor-beta signaling in T cells.,"Despite the existence of tumor-specific antigens and demonstrated presence of tumor-specific immune cells, the majority of tumors manage to avoid immune-mediated destruction. Various mechanisms have been suggested for tumor evasion from immune response. One such mechanism is thought to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), an immunosuppressive cytokine found at the site of most tumors. We demonstrate here that T-cell-specific blockade of TGF-beta signaling allows the generation of an immune response capable of eradicating tumors in mice challenged with live tumor cells. In addition, we provide mechanisms through which abrogation of TGF-beta signaling leads to the enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. Our data indicate that T-cell-specific blockade of TGF-beta signaling has strong therapeutic potential to shift the balance of the immune response in favor of anti-tumor immunity.","Gorelik, L;Flavell, R A"
11533709,2001,Nature medicine,Acceleration of intestinal polyposis through prostaglandin receptor EP2 in Apc(Delta 716) knockout mice.,"Arachidonic acid is metabolized to prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) by cyclooxygenase (COX). COX-2, the inducible COX isozyme, has a key role in intestinal polyposis. Among the metabolites of PGH(2), PGE(2) is implicated in tumorigenesis because its level is markedly elevated in tissues of intestinal adenoma and colon cancer. Here we show that homozygous deletion of the gene encoding a cell-surface receptor of PGE(2), EP2, causes decreases in number and size of intestinal polyps in Apc(Delta 716) mice (a mouse model for human familial adenomatous polyposis). This effect is similar to that of COX-2 gene disruption. We also show that COX-2 expression is boosted by PGE(2) through the EP2 receptor via a positive feedback loop. Homozygous gene knockout for other PGE(2) receptors, EP1 or EP3, did not affect intestinal polyp formation in Apc(Delta 716) mice. We conclude that EP2 is the major receptor mediating the PGE2 signal generated by COX-2 upregulation in intestinal polyposis, and that increased cellular cAMP stimulates expression of more COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor in the polyp stroma.","Sonoshita, M;Takaku, K;Sasaki, N;Sugimoto, Y;Ushikubi, F;Narumiya, S;Oshima, M;Taketo, M M"
11533703,2001,Nature medicine,Glutamate release promotes growth of malignant gliomas.,"Glutamate neurotoxicity has been implicated in stroke, head trauma, multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Although recent data show that cultured glioma cells secrete glutamate, the growth potential of brain tumors has not yet been linked to an excitotoxic mechanism. Using bioluminescence detection of glutamate release from freshly prepared brain slices, we show that implanted glioma cells continue to secrete glutamate. Moreover, gliomas with high glutamate release have a distinct growth advantage in host brain that is not present in vitro. Treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 or memantine slowed the growth of glutamate-secreting tumors in situ, suggesting that activation of NMDA receptors facilitates tumor expansion. These findings support a new approach for therapy of brain tumors, based upon antagonizing glutamate secretion or its target receptors.","Takano, T;Lin, J H;Arcuino, G;Gao, Q;Yang, J;Nedergaard, M"
11479629,2001,Nature medicine,Tumoricidal activity of a novel anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody without hepatocyte cytotoxicity.,"A novel anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody, TRA-8, induces apoptosis of most tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-sensitive tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to both the membrane-bound form of human TRAIL, which induced severe hepatitis in mice, and the soluble form of human TRAIL, which induced apoptosis of normal human hepatocytes in vitro, TRA-8 did not induce significant cell death of normal human hepatocytes. However, both primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells and an established liver cancer cell line were highly susceptible to the killing mediated by TRA-8. We show here that elevated levels of cell-surface expression of DR5 and increased susceptibility to DR5-mediated apoptosis are characteristics of malignant tumor cells. In contrast, DR5 alone is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis of normal hepatocytes. Therefore, selective, specific targeting of DR5 with an agonistic antibody might be a safe and effective strategy for cancer therapy.","Ichikawa, K;Liu, W;Zhao, L;Wang, Z;Liu, D;Ohtsuka, T;Zhang, H;Mountz, J D;Koopman, W J;Kimberly, R P;Zhou, T"

Using replication-competent HSV-1 oncolytic viruses with thymidine kinase (TK) under control of different promoters, we demonstrate that viral infection, proliferation and promoter characteristics all interact to influence FIAU accumulation and imaging. In vivo, as few as 1 x 107 viral particles injected into a 0.5-cm human colorectal tumor can be detected by [(124)I]FIAU PET imaging. PET signal intensity is significantly greater at 48 hours compared with that at 8 hours after viral injection, demonstrating that PET scanning can detect changes in TK activity resulting from local viral proliferation. We also show the ability of FIAU-PET scanning to detect differences in viral infectivity at 0.5 log increments. Non-invasive imaging might be useful in assessing biologically relevant distribution of virus in therapies using replication-competent HSV.","Bennett, J J;Tjuvajev, J;Johnson, P;Doubrovin, M;Akhurst, T;Malholtra, S;Hackman, T;Balatoni, J;Finn, R;Larson, S M;Federoff, H;Blasberg, R;Fong, Y"
11433349,2001,Nature medicine,Nicotine stimulates angiogenesis and promotes tumor growth and atherosclerosis.,"We provide anatomic and functional evidence that nicotine induces angiogenesis. We also show that nicotine accelerates the growth of tumor and atheroma in association with increased neovascularization. Nicotine increased endothelial-cell growth and tube formation in vitro, and accelerated fibrovascular growth in vivo. In a mouse model of hind-limb ischemia, nicotine increased capillary and collateral growth, and enhanced tissue perfusion. In mouse models of lung cancer and atherosclerosis, we found that nicotine enhanced lesion growth in association with an increase in lesion vascularity. These effects of nicotine were mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at nicotine concentrations that are pathophysiologically relevant. The endothelial production of nitric oxide, prostacyclin and vascular endothelial growth factor might have a role in these effects.","Heeschen, C;Jang, J J;Weis, M;Pathak, A;Kaji, S;Hu, R S;Tsao, P S;Johnson, F L;Cooke, J P"
11433342,2001,Nature medicine,Adoptive transfer of minor histocompatibility antigen-specific T lymphocytes eradicates leukemia cells without causing graft-versus-host disease.,"Adoptive transfer of T cells reactive to minor histocompatibility antigens has the unmatched ability to eradicate malignant hematopoietic cells. Unfortunately, its use is hampered by the associated graft-versus-host disease. The critical issue of a possible dissociation of the antileukemic effect and graft-versus-host disease by targeting specific minor histocompatibility antigens remains unresolved because of the unknown nature and number of minor histocompatibility antigens necessary or sufficient to elicit anti-leukemic activity and graft-versus-host disease. We found that injection of T lymphocytes primed against a single major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigen (B6dom1) caused no graft-versus-host disease but produced a curative anti-leukemic response. Avoidance of graft-versus-host disease required that no other host-reactive T cells be co-injected with T cells primed with B6dom1. Here we show that effective and non-toxic immunotherapy of hematologic malignancies can be achieved by targeting a single immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigen.","Fontaine, P;Roy-Proulx, G;Knafo, L;Baron, C;Roy, D C;Perreault, C"

We show here that novel, biocompatible near-infrared fluorogenic MMP substrates can be used as activatable reporter probes to sense MMP activity in intact tumors in nude mice. Moreover, we show for the first time that the effect of MMP inhibition can be directly imaged using this approach within hours after initiation of treatment using the potent MMP inhibitor, prinomastat (AG3340).

Here we show that in NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, retinoids selective for retinoic-acid receptor-alpha induced an autoregulatory circuitry of survival programs followed by expression of the membrane-bound tumor-selective death ligand, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also called Apo-2L). In a paracrine mode of action, TRAIL killed NB4 as well as heterologous and retinoic-acid-resistant cells. In the leukemic blasts of freshly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, retinoic-acid-induced expression of TRAIL most likely caused blast apoptosis. Thus, induction of TRAIL-mediated death signaling appears to contribute to the therapeutic value of retinoids.","Altucci, L;Rossin, A;Raffelsberger, W;Reitmair, A;Chomienne, C;Gronemeyer, H"
11385503,2001,Nature medicine,Classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers using gene expression profiling and artificial neural networks.,"The purpose of this study was to develop a method of classifying cancers to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression signatures using artificial neural networks (ANNs). We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell tumors (SRBCTs) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The ANNs correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy.","Khan, J;Wei, J S;Ringnér, M;Saal, L H;Ladanyi, M;Westermann, F;Berthold, F;Schwab, M;Antonescu, C R;Peterson, C;Meltzer, P S"

11329059,2001,Nature medicine,Synergism between vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor contributes to angiogenesis and plasma extravasation in pathological conditions.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates angiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). The role of its homolog, placental growth factor (PlGF), remains unknown. Both VEGF and PlGF bind to VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), but it is unknown whether VEGFR-1, which exists as a soluble or a membrane-bound type, is an inert decoy or a signaling receptor for PlGF during angiogenesis. Here, we report that embryonic angiogenesis in mice was not affected by deficiency of PlGF (Pgf-/-). VEGF-B, another ligand of VEGFR-1, did not rescue development in Pgf-/- mice. However, loss of PlGF impaired angiogenesis, plasma extravasation and collateral growth during ischemia, inflammation, wound healing and cancer. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow rescued the impaired angiogenesis and collateral growth in Pgf-/- mice, indicating that PlGF might have contributed to vessel growth in the adult by mobilizing bone-marrow-derived cells. The synergism between PlGF and VEGF was specific, as PlGF deficiency impaired the response to VEGF, but not to bFGF or histamine. VEGFR-1 was activated by PlGF, given that anti-VEGFR-1 antibodies and a Src-kinase inhibitor blocked the endothelial response to PlGF or VEGF/PlGF. By upregulating PlGF and the signaling subtype of VEGFR-1, endothelial cells amplify their responsiveness to VEGF during the 'angiogenic switch' in many pathological disorders.","Carmeliet, P;Moons, L;Luttun, A;Vincenti, V;Compernolle, V;De Mol, M;Wu, Y;Bono, F;Devy, L;Beck, H;Scholz, D;Acker, T;DiPalma, T;Dewerchin, M;Noel, A;Stalmans, I;Barra, A;Blacher, S;VandenDriessche, T;Ponten, A;Eriksson, U;Plate, K H;Foidart, J M;Schaper, W;Charnock-Jones, D S;Hicklin, D J;Herbert, J M;Collen, D;Persico, M G"

Patients' bone marrow and peripheral blood contained CD8+ T cells that specifically bound HLA/peptide tetramers. In short-term culture with autologous dendritic cells pre-pulsed with tumor lysates, patients' memory T cells from bone marrow (but not peripheral blood) could be specifically reactivated to interferon-gamma-producing and cytotoxic effector cells. A single transfer of restimulated bone-marrow T cells into NOD/SCID mice caused regression of autologous tumor xenotransplants associated with infiltration by human T cells and tumor-cell apoptosis and necrosis.

11283671,2001,Nature medicine,AML1-ETO downregulates the granulocytic differentiation factor C/EBPalpha in t(8;21) myeloid leukemia.,"The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, or C/EBPalpha, encoded by the CEBPA gene, is crucial for the differentiation of granulocytes. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha triggers neutrophilic differentiation, and Cebpa knockout mice exhibit an early block in maturation. Dominant-negative mutations of CEBPA have been found in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in AML with the t(8;21) translocation which gives rise to the fusion gene RUNX1-CBF2T1 (also known as AML1-ETO) encoding the AML1-ETO fusion protein. RUNX1-CBF2T1 positive-AML blasts had eight-fold lower CEBPA RNA levels and undetectable C/EBPalpha protein levels compared with other subgroups of AML patients. Conditional expression of RUNX1-CBF2T1 in U937 cells downregulated CEBPA mRNA, protein and DNA binding activity. AML1-ETO appears to suppress C/EBPalpha expression indirectly by inhibiting positive autoregulation of the CEBPA promoter. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha in AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells results in neutrophilic differentiation. We suggest that restoring C/EBPalpha expression will have therapeutic implications in RUNX1-CBF2T1-positive leukemias.","Pabst, T;Mueller, B U;Harakawa, N;Schoch, C;Haferlach, T;Behre, G;Hiddemann, W;Zhang, D E;Tenen, D G"
11231635,2001,Nature medicine,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein EBNA-3C interacts with the human metastatic suppressor Nm23-H1: a molecular link to cancer metastasis.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus associated with a number of human malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoproliferative disease and, though still debated, breast carcinoma. A subset of latent EBV antigens is required for mediating immortalization of primary B-lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal region of the essential latent antigen, EBNA-3C, interacts specifically with the human metastatic suppressor protein Nm23-H1. Moreover, EBNA-3C reverses the ability of Nm23-H1 to suppress the migration of Burkitt lymphoma cells and breast carcinoma cells. We propose that EBNA-3C contributes to EBV-associated human cancers by targeting and altering the role of the metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1.","Subramanian, C;Cotter, M A;Robertson, E S"
11231627,2001,Nature medicine,Tumor-derived exosomes are a source of shared tumor rejection antigens for CTL cross-priming.,"The initiation of T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses requires the uptake and processing of tumor antigens by dendritic cells and their presentation on MHC-I molecules. Here we show in a human in vitro model system that exosomes, a population of small membrane vesicles secreted by living tumor cells, contain and transfer tumor antigens to dendritic cells. After mouse tumor exosome uptake, dendritic cells induce potent CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor effects on syngeneic and allogeneic established mouse tumors. Therefore, exosomes represent a novel source of tumor-rejection antigens for T-cell cross priming, relevant for immunointerventions.","Wolfers, J;Lozier, A;Raposo, G;Regnault, A;Théry, C;Masurier, C;Flament, C;Pouzieux, S;Faure, F;Tursz, T;Angevin, E;Amigorena, S;Zitvogel, L"
11175856,2001,Nature medicine,c-MYC induces mammary tumorigenesis by means of a preferred pathway involving spontaneous Kras2 mutations.,"Although the process of mammary tumorigenesis requires multiple genetic events, it is unclear to what extent carcinogenesis proceeds through preferred secondary pathways following a specific initiating oncogenic event. Similarly, the extent to which established mammary tumors remain dependent on individual mutations for maintenance of the transformed state is unknown. Here we use the tetracycline regulatory system to conditionally express the human c-MYC oncogene in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice. MYC encodes a transcription factor implicated in multiple human cancers. In particular, amplification and overexpression of c-MYC in human breast cancers is associated with poor prognosis, although the genetic mechanisms by which c-MYC promotes tumor progression are poorly understood. We show that deregulated c-MYC expression in this inducible system results in the formation of invasive mammary adenocarcinomas, many of which fully regress following c-MYC deinduction. Approximately half of these tumors harbor spontaneous activating point mutations in the ras family of proto-oncogenes with a strong preference for Kras2 compared with Hras1. Nearly all tumors lacking activating ras mutations fully regressed following c-MYC deinduction, whereas tumors bearing ras mutations did not, suggesting that secondary mutations in ras contribute to tumor progression. These findings demonstrate that c-MYC-induced mammary tumorigenesis proceeds through a preferred secondary oncogenic pathway involving Kras2.","D'Cruz, C M;Gunther, E J;Boxer, R B;Hartman, J L;Sintasath, L;Moody, S E;Cox, J D;Ha, S I;Belka, G K;Golant, A;Cardiff, R D;Chodosh, L A"
11175850,2001,Nature medicine,Induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by VEGF-C promotes breast cancer metastasis.,"Metastasis of breast cancer occurs primarily through the lymphatic system, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a key prognostic factor for the disease. Whereas the significance of angiogenesis for tumor progression has been well documented, the ability of tumor cells to induce the growth of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) and the presence of intratumoral lymphatic vessels have been controversial. Using a novel marker for lymphatic endothelium, LYVE-1, we demonstrate here the occurrence of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis within human breast cancers after orthotopic transplantation onto nude mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C overexpression in breast cancer cells potently increased intratumoral lymphangiogenesis, resulting in significantly enhanced metastasis to regional lymph nodes and to lungs. The degree of tumor lymphangiogenesis was highly correlated with the extent of lymph node and lung metastases. These results establish the occurrence and biological significance of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer and identify VEGF-C as a molecular link between tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis.","Skobe, M;Hawighorst, T;Jackson, D G;Prevo, R;Janes, L;Velasco, P;Riccardi, L;Alitalo, K;Claffey, K;Detmar, M"

Here we have assessed the effect of Egr1 deficiency on tumor development in two transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer (CR2-T-Ag and TRAMP). Using a combination of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological and survival analyses, we show that tumor progression was significantly impaired in Egr1-/- mice. Tumor initiation and tumor growth rate were not affected by the lack of Egr1; however, Egr1 deficiency significantly delayed the progression from prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma. These results indicate a unique role for Egr1 in regulating the transition from localized, carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma.","Abdulkadir, S A;Qu, Z;Garabedian, E;Song, S K;Peters, T J;Svaren, J;Carbone, J M;Naughton, C K;Catalona, W J;Ackerman, J J;Gordon, J I;Humphrey, P A;Milbrandt, J"
11135622,2001,Nature medicine,Involvement of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in surveillance of tumor metastasis by liver natural killer cells.,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in various tumor cells in vitro, but its physiological role in tumor surveillance remains unknown. Here, we report that TRAIL is constitutively expressed on murine natural killer (NK) cells in the liver and plays a substantial role in suppressing tumor metastasis. Freshly isolated NK cells, but not natural killer T cells or ordinary T cells, from the liver expressed cell surface TRAIL, which was responsible for spontaneous cytotoxicity against TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells in vitro along with perforin and Fas ligand (FasL). Administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibody against TRAIL significantly increased experimental liver metastases of several TRAIL-sensitive tumor cell lines. Such an anti-metastatic effect of TRAIL was not observed in NK cell-depleted mice or interferon-gamma-deficient mice, the latter of which lacked TRAIL on liver NK cells. These findings provide the first evidence for the physiological function of TRAIL as a tumor suppressor.","Takeda, K;Hayakawa, Y;Smyth, M J;Kayagaki, N;Yamaguchi, N;Kakuta, S;Iwakura, Y;Yagita, H;Okumura, K"
11135621,2001,Nature medicine,SADS: A new component of Fas-DISC is the accelerator for cell death signaling and is downregulated in patients with colon carcinoma.,"Fas is the death receptor, transducing cell death signaling upon stimulation by Fas ligand. During Fas-initiated cell death signaling, the formation of Fas-death inducing signaling complex (Fas-DISC) is the first step. Here we have identified a new component of Fas-DISC which we call 'small-accelerator for death signaling' (SADS). SADS cDNA encodes a 150 amino acid polypeptide (Mr = 16,700). During Fas-mediated cell death, SADS enhances the interaction of Fas-death domain-interactive factors (FADD) and procaspase-8, and deletion mutant analysis has identified FADD- and caspase-8-interactive domains in SADS. Inhibition or removal of SADS delays Fas-mediated cell death. In addition, we demonstrate the deletion or mutation of SADS in patients with colon carcinoma and that exogenous SADS expression in human colon carcinoma SW480 cells that lack SADS leads to re-acquisition of Fas-mediated cell death. Here, we propose that SADS is one of the cell death-associated factors and enhances Fas-DISC formation, especially FADD and procaspase-8 recruitment.","Suzuki, A;Obata, S;Hayashida, M;Kawano, H;Nakano, T;Shiraki, K"

11100117,2000,Nature medicine,Suppression of tumor growth through disruption of hypoxia-inducible transcription.,"Chronic hypoxia, a hallmark of many tumors, is associated with angiogenesis and tumor progression. Strategies to treat tumors have been developed in which tumor cells are targeted with drugs or gene-therapy vectors specifically activated under hypoxic conditions. Here we report a different approach, in which the normal transcriptional response to hypoxia is selectively disrupted. Our data indicate that specific blockade of the interaction of hypoxia-inducible factor with the CH1 domain of its p300 and CREB binding protein transcriptional coactivators leads to attenuation of hypoxia-inducible gene expression and diminution of tumor growth. Thus, disrupting the normal co-activational response to hypoxia may be a new and useful therapeutic strategy.","Kung, A L;Wang, S;Klco, J M;Kaelin, W G;Livingston, D M"
11062536,2000,Nature medicine,A peptide-doxorubicin 'prodrug' activated by prostate-specific antigen selectively kills prostate tumor cells positive for prostate-specific antigen in vivo.,"We covalently linked doxorubicin with a peptide that is hydrolyzable by prostate-specific antigen. In the presence of prostate tumor cells secreting prostate-specific antigen, the peptide moiety of this conjugate, L-377,202, was hydrolyzed, resulting in the release of leucine-doxorubicin and doxorubicin, which are both very cytotoxic to cancer cells. However, L-377,202 was much less cytotoxic than conventional doxorubicin to cells in culture that do not secrete prostate-specific antigen. L-377,202 was approximately 15 times more effective than was conventional doxorubicin at inhibiting the growth of human prostate cancer tumors in nude mice when both drugs were used at their maximally tolerated doses. Nude mice inoculated with human prostate tumor cells secreting prostate-specific antigen showed considerable reductions in tumor burden with minimal total body weight loss when treated with L-377, 202. This improvement in therapeutic index correlated with the selective localization of leucine-doxorubicin and free doxorubicin in tissues secreting prostate-specific antigen after exposure to L-377,202.","DeFeo-Jones, D;Garsky, V M;Wong, B K;Feng, D M;Bolyar, T;Haskell, K;Kiefer, D M;Leander, K;McAvoy, E;Lumma, P;Wai, J;Senderak, E T;Motzel, S L;Keenan, K;Van Zwieten, M;Lin, J H;Freidinger, R;Huff, J;Oliff, A;Jones, R E"

Furthermore, autoreactive immunity targeting to microvessels in solid tumors was induced and was probably responsible for the anti-tumor activity.

11017143,2000,Nature medicine,The latent nuclear antigen of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus targets the retinoblastoma-E2F pathway and with the oncogene Hras transforms primary rat cells.,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is involved in the etiopathogenesis of Kaposi sar-coma and certain lymphoproliferative disorders. Open reading frame (ORF) 73 encodes the main immunogenic latent nuclear antigen (LNA-1) of KSHV. LNA-1 maintains the KSHV episome and tethers the viral genome to chromatin during mitosis. In addition, LNA-1 interacts with p53 and represses its transcriptional activity. Here we show that LNA-1 also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein. LNA-1 transactivated an artificial promoter carrying the cell cycle transcription factor E2F DNA-binding sequences and also upregulated the cyclin E (CCNEI) promoter, but not the B-myb (MYBL2) promoter. LNA-1 overcame the flat-cell phenotype induced by retinoblastoma protein in Saos2 cells. In cooperation with the cellular oncogene Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Hras), LNA-1 transformed primary rat embryo fibroblasts and rendered them tumorigenic. These findings indicate that LNA-1 acts as a transcription co-factor and may contribute to KSHV-induced oncogenesis by targeting the retinoblastoma protein-E2F transcriptional regulatory pathway.","Radkov, S A;Kellam, P;Boshoff, C"
10973324,2000,Nature medicine,Genetic analysis of chemoresistance in primary murine lymphomas.,"Understanding the basis of chemoresistance is a principal goal of molecular oncology. We have exploited a murine lymphoma model and retroviral gene transfer to rapidly generate a series of spontaneous tumors differing only in a gene of interest, and subsequently studied the impact of the test gene on the treatment sensitivity of tumors at their natural site. We demonstrate that the Bcl-2 oncoprotein produces multi-drug resistance when assessed in primary lymphomas in vivo. In contrast, this effect was dramatically reduced when the primary lymphomas were subjected to long-term culture, and completely missed in the standard clonogenic survival assay. This model highlights the importance of physiological test systems to address the complexity of clinical drug resistance and provides a novel strategy to evaluate compounds targeting specific genetic lesions.","Schmitt, C A;Rosenthal, C T;Lowe, S W"

10973322,2000,Nature medicine,Evidence that specific T lymphocytes may participate in the elimination of chronic myelogenous leukemia.,"Although the immune system has long been implicated in the control of cancer, evidence for specific and efficacious immune responses in human cancer has been lacking. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), either allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) or interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) therapy can result in complete remission, but the mechanism for prolonged disease control is unknown and may involve immune anti-leukemic responses. We previously demonstrated that PR1, a peptide derived from proteinase 3, is a potential target for CML-specific T cells. Here we studied 38 CML patients treated with allogeneic BMT, IFN- alpha2b or chemotherapy to look for PR1-specific T cells using PR1/HLA-A*0201 tetrameric complexes. There was a strong correlation between the presence of PR1-specific T cells and clinical responses after IFN-alpha and allogeneic BMT.

10973321,2000,Nature medicine,Induction of cytotoxic T cell responses and tumor immunity against unrelated tumors using telomerase reverse transcriptase RNA transfected dendritic cells.,"The polypeptide component of telomerase (TERT) is an attractive candidate for a broadly expressed tumor rejection antigen because telomerase is silent in normal tissues but is reactivated in more than 85% of cancers. Here we show that immunization against TERT induces immunity against tumors of unrelated origin. Immunization of mice with TERT RNA-transfected dendritic cells (DC) stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which lysed melanoma and thymoma tumor cells and inhibited the growth of three unrelated tumors in mice of distinct genetic backgrounds. TERT RNA-transfected human DC stimulated TERT-specific CTL in vitro that lysed human tumor cells, including Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells as well as autologous tumor targets from patients with renal and prostate cancer. Tumor RNA-transfected DC were used as surrogate targets in the CTL assays, obviating the difficulties in obtaining tumor cells from cancer patients. In one instance, where a tumor cell line was successfully established in culture from a patient with renal cancer, the patient's tumor cells were efficiently lysed by the CTL. Immunization with tumor RNA was generally more effective than immunization with TERT RNA, suggesting that an optimal immunization protocol may have to include TERT as well as additional tumor antigens.","Nair, S K;Heiser, A;Boczkowski, D;Majumdar, A;Naoe, M;Lebkowski, J S;Vieweg, J;Gilboa, E"

10932223,2000,Nature medicine,The mammary gland iodide transporter is expressed during lactation and in breast cancer.,"The sodium/iodide symporter mediates active iodide transport in both healthy and cancerous thyroid tissue. By exploiting this activity, radioiodide has been used for decades with considerable success in the detection and treatment of thyroid cancer. Here we show that a specialized form of the sodium/iodide symporter in the mammary gland mediates active iodide transport in healthy lactating (but not in nonlactating) mammary gland and in mammary tumors. In addition to characterizing the hormonal regulation of the mammary gland sodium/iodide symporter, we demonstrate by scintigraphy that mammary adenocarcinomas in transgenic mice bearing Ras or Neu oncogenes actively accumulate iodide by this symporter in vivo. Moreover, more than 80% of the human breast cancer samples we analyzed by immunohistochemistry expressed the symporter, compared with none of the normal (nonlactating) samples from reductive mammoplasties. These results indicate that the mammary gland sodium/iodide symporter may be an essential breast cancer marker and that radioiodide should be studied as a possible option in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.","Tazebay, U H;Wapnir, I L;Levy, O;Dohan, O;Zuckier, L S;Zhao, Q H;Deng, H F;Amenta, P S;Fineberg, S;Pestell, R G;Carrasco, N"

10888935,2000,Nature medicine,The neuronal repressor REST/NRSF is an essential regulator in medulloblastoma cells.,"Medulloblastoma is the most malignant pediatric brain tumor. It is believed to originate from the undifferentiated external granule layer cells in the cerebellum, but the mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here we studied three types of human medulloblastoma cells that express markers corresponding to different levels of neuronal differentiation. They expressed the neuronal repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF; refs. 7-10) at very high levels compared with either neuronal progenitor NTera2 (NT2) cells or fully differentiated human neuron teratocarcinoma (hNT cells). To counter the effect of REST/NRSF, we used a recombinant transcription factor, REST-VP16, constructed by replacing repressor domains of REST/NRSF with the activation domain of viral protein (VP16). Transient expression of REST-VP16 in medulloblastoma cells was able to compete with the endogenous REST/NRSF for DNA binding and stimulate neuronal promoters. High-efficiency expression of REST-VP16 mediated by adenovirus vectors (Ad.REST-VP16) in medulloblastoma cells was able to counter REST/NRSF-mediated repression of neuronal promoters, stimulate expression of endogenous neuronal genes and trigger apoptosis through the activation of caspase cascades. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of Ad.REST-VP16 in established medulloblastoma tumors in nude mice inhibited their growth. Therefore, REST/NRSF may serve as a new target for therapeutic interventions for medulloblastoma through agents such as REST-VP16.","Lawinger, P;Venugopal, R;Guo, Z S;Immaneni, A;Sengupta, D;Lu, W;Rastelli, L;Marin Dias Carneiro, A;Levin, V;Fuller, G N;Echelard, Y;Majumder, S"
10888934,2000,Nature medicine,Exploiting tumor-specific defects in the interferon pathway with a previously unknown oncolytic virus.,"Interferons are circulating factors that bind to cell surface receptors, activating a signaling cascade, ultimately leading to both an antiviral response and an induction of growth inhibitory and/or apoptotic signals in normal and tumor cells. Attempts to exploit the ability of interferons to limit the growth of tumors in patients has met with limited results because of cancer-specific mutations of gene products in the interferon pathway. Although interferon-non-responsive cancer cells may have acquired a growth/survival advantage over their normal counterparts, they may have simultaneously compromised their antiviral response. To test this, we used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus exquisitely sensitive to treatment with interferon. VSV rapidly replicated in and selectively killed a variety of human tumor cell lines even in the presence of doses of interferon that completely protected normal human primary cell cultures. A single intratumoral injection of VSV was effective in reducing the tumor burden of nude mice bearing subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts. Our results support the use of VSV as a replication-competent oncolytic virus and demonstrate a new strategy for the treatment of interferon non-responsive tumors.","Stojdl, D F;Lichty, B;Knowles, S;Marius, R;Atkins, H;Sonenberg, N;Bell, J C"
10835690,2000,Nature medicine,Glucocorticoids can promote androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells through a mutated androgen receptor.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is involved in the development, growth and progression of prostate cancer (CaP). CaP often progresses from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent tumor, making androgen ablation therapy ineffective. However, the mechanisms for the development of androgen-independent CaP are unclear. More than 80% of clinically androgen-independent prostate tumors show high levels of AR expression. In some CaPs, AR levels are increased because of gene amplification and/or overexpression, whereas in others, the AR is mutated. Nonetheless, the involvement of the AR in the transition of CaP to androgen-independent growth and the subsequent failure of endocrine therapy are not fully understood. Here we show that in CaP cells from a patient who failed androgen ablation therapy, a doubly mutated AR functioned as a high-affinity cortisol/cortisone receptor (ARccr). Cortisol, the main circulating glucocorticoid, and its metabolite, cortisone, both equally stimulate the growth of these CaP cells and increase the secretion of prostate-specific antigen in the absence of androgens. The physiological concentrations of free cortisol and total cortisone in men greatly exceed the binding affinity of the ARccr and would activate the receptor, promoting CaP cell proliferation. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism for the androgen-independent growth of advanced CaP. Understanding this mechanism and recognizing the presence of glucocorticoid-responsive AR mutants are important for the development of new forms of therapy for the treatment of this subset of CaP.","Zhao, X Y;Malloy, P J;Krishnan, A V;Swami, S;Navone, N M;Peehl, D M;Feldman, D"

Immunogenic peptides were derived from framework regions of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin that were shared among patients.

10802707,2000,Nature medicine,"Osteoprotegerin blocks bone cancer-induced skeletal destruction, skeletal pain and pain-related neurochemical reorganization of the spinal cord.","Bone cancer pain is common among cancer patients and can have a devastating effect on their quality of life. A chief problem in designing new therapies for bone cancer pain is that it is unclear what mechanisms drive this distinct pain condition. Here we show that osteoprotegerin, a secreted 'decoy' receptor that inhibits osteoclast activity, also blocks behaviors indicative of pain in mice with bone cancer. A substantial part of the actions of osteoprotegerin seems to result from inhibition of tumor-induced bone destruction that in turn inhibits the neurochemical changes in the spinal cord that are thought to be involved in the generation and maintenance of cancer pain. These results demonstrate that excessive tumor-induced bone destruction is involved in the generation of bone cancer pain and that osteoprotegerin may provide an effective treatment for this common human condition.","Honore, P;Luger, N M;Sabino, M A;Schwei, M J;Rogers, S D;Mach, D B;O'keefe, P F;Ramnaraine, M L;Clohisy, D R;Mantyh, P W"
10742153,2000,Nature medicine,Gene therapy of experimental brain tumors using neural progenitor cells.,"Glioblastomas, the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors, have a very poor prognosis. Gene therapy of glioblastomas is limited by the short survival of viral vectors and by their difficulty in reaching glioblastoma cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma. Neural stem/progenitor cells can be engineered to produce therapeutic molecules and have the potential to overcome these limitations because they may travel along the white matter, like neoplastic cells, and engraft stably into the brain. Retrovirus-mediated transfer of the gene for interleukin-4 is an effective treatment for rat brain glioblastomas. Here, we transferred the gene for interleukin-4 into C57BL6J mouse primary neural progenitor cells and injected those cells into established syngeneic brain glioblastomas. This led to the survival of most tumor-bearing mice. We obtained similar results by implanting immortalized neural progenitor cells derived from Sprague-Dawley rats into C6 glioblastomas. We also documented by magnetic resonance imaging the progressive disappearance of large tumors, and detected 5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeled progenitor cells several weeks after the injection. These findings support a new approach for gene therapy of brain tumors, based on the grafting of neural stem cells producing therapeutic molecules.","Benedetti, S;Pirola, B;Pollo, B;Magrassi, L;Bruzzone, M G;Rigamonti, D;Galli, R;Selleri, S;Di Meco, F;De Fraja, C;Vescovi, A;Cattaneo, E;Finocchiaro, G"
10742152,2000,Nature medicine,Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytotoxicity against tumor targets.,"Inhibitory receptors have been proposed to modulate the in vivo cytotoxic response against tumor targets for both spontaneous and antibody-dependent pathways. Using a variety of syngenic and xenograft models, we demonstrate here that the inhibitory FcgammaRIIB molecule is a potent regulator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo, modulating the activity of FcgammaRIII on effector cells. Although many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the anti-tumor activities of therapeutic antibodies, including extended half-life, blockade of signaling pathways, activation of apoptosis and effector-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we show here that engagement of Fcgamma receptors on effector cells is a dominant component of the in vivo activity of antibodies against tumors. Mouse monoclonal antibodies, as well as the humanized, clinically effective therapeutic agents trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) and rituximab (Rituxan(R)), engaged both activation (FcgammaRIII) and inhibitory (FcgammaRIIB) antibody receptors on myeloid cells, thus modulating their cytotoxic potential. Mice deficient in FcgammaRIIB showed much more antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; in contrast, mice deficient in activating Fc receptors as well as antibodies engineered to disrupt Fc binding to those receptors were unable to arrest tumor growth in vivo. These results demonstrate that Fc-receptor-dependent mechanisms contribute substantially to the action of cytotoxic antibodies against tumors and indicate that an optimal antibody against tumors would bind preferentially to activation Fc receptors and minimally to the inhibitory partner FcgammaRIIB.","Clynes, R A;Towers, T L;Presta, L G;Ravetch, J V"
10700237,2000,Nature medicine,Regression of human metastatic renal cell carcinoma after vaccination with tumor cell-dendritic cell hybrids.,"Reports of spontaneous regressions of metastases and the demonstration of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes indicate the importance of the host's immune system in controlling the devastating course of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Recent research indicates that immunization with hybrids of tumor and antigen presenting cells results in protective immunity and rejection of established tumors in various rodent models. Here, we present a hybrid cell vaccination study of 17 patients. Using electrofusion techniques, we generated hybrids of autologous tumor and allogeneic dendritic cells that presented antigens expressed by the tumor in concert with the co-stimulating capabilities of dendritic cells. After vaccination, and with a mean follow-up time of 13 months, four patients completely rejected all metastatic tumor lesions, one presented a 'mixed response', and two had a tumor mass reduction of greater 50%. We also demonstrate induction of HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T cells reactive with the Muc1 tumor-associated antigen and recruitment of CD8+ lymphocytes into tumor challenge sites. Our data indicate that hybrid cell vaccination is a safe and effective therapy for renal cell carcinoma and may provide a broadly applicable strategy for other malignancies with unknown antigens.","Kugler, A;Stuhler, G;Walden, P;Zöller, G;Zobywalski, A;Brossart, P;Trefzer, U;Ullrich, S;Müller, C A;Becker, V;Gross, A J;Hemmerlein, B;Kanz, L;Müller, G A;Ringert, R H"

Using a mouse model developed to reproduce this type of hepatic injury, we found that hepatocyte transplantation only slightly improved survival after transplantation despite the fact that many non-survivors showed moderate liver repopulation by donor cells. Perhaps accounting for this outcome, donor parenchyma in non-survivors did not have typical lobular organization. These results indicate that the re-creation of functional parenchyma by transplanted hepatocytes requires time, during which donor cells proliferate and then establish normal parenchymal architecture.","Braun, K M;Degen, J L;Sandgren, E P"
10700234,2000,Nature medicine,Anti-tumoral action of cannabinoids: involvement of sustained ceramide accumulation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.,"Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture. Here, we show that intratumoral administration of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used. Experiments with two subclones of C6 glioma cells in culture showed that cannabinoids signal apoptosis by a pathway involving cannabinoid receptors, sustained ceramide accumulation and Raf1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. These results may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas.","Galve-Roperh, I;Sánchez, C;Cortés, M L;Gómez  del Pulgar, T;Izquierdo, M;Guzmán, M"
10700233,2000,Nature medicine,Suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in Mgat5-deficient mice.,"Golgi beta1,6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5) is required in the biosynthesis of beta1,6GlcNAc-branched N-linked glycans attached to cell surface and secreted glycoproteins. Amounts of MGAT5 glycan products are commonly increased in malignancies, and correlate with disease progression. To study the functions of these N-glycans in development and disease, we generated mice deficient in Mgat5 by targeted gene mutation. These Mgat5-/- mice lacked Mgat5 products and appeared normal, but differed in their responses to certain extrinsic conditions. Mammary tumor growth and metastases induced by the polyomavirus middle T oncogene was considerably less in Mgat5-/- mice than in transgenic littermates expressing Mgat5. Furthermore, Mgat5 glycan products stimulated membrane ruffling and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B activation, fueling a positive feedback loop that amplified oncogene signaling and tumor growth in vivo. Our results indicate that inhibitors of MGAT5 might be useful in the treatment of malignancies by targeting their dependency on focal adhesion signaling for growth and metastasis.","Granovsky, M;Fata, J;Pawling, J;Muller, W J;Khokha, R;Dennis, J W"
10655108,2000,Nature medicine,The ets protein PEA3 suppresses HER-2/neu overexpression and inhibits tumorigenesis.,"Because HER-2/neu overexpression is important in cancer development, we looked for a method of suppressing the cell transformation mediated by HER-2/neu overexpression. We have identified that the DNA-binding protein PEA3, which is encoded by a previously isolated gene of the ets family, specifically targeted a DNA sequence on the HER-2/neu promoter and downregulated the promoter activity. Expression of PEA3 resulted in preferential inhibition of cell growth and tumor development of HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells. This is a new approach to targeting HER-2/neu overexpression and also provides a rationale to the design for repressors of diseases caused by overexpression of pathogenic genes.","Xing, X;Wang, S C;Xia, W;Zou, Y;Shao, R;Kwong, K Y;Yu, Z;Zhang, S;Miller, S;Huang, L;Hung, M C"
10613833,2000,Nature medicine,Intravascular origin of metastasis from the proliferation of endothelium-attached tumor cells: a new model for metastasis.,"Metastasis is a frequent complication of cancer, yet the process through which circulating tumor cells form distant colonies is poorly understood. We have been able to observe the steps in early hematogenous metastasis by epifluorescence microscopy of tumor cells expressing green fluorescent protein in subpleural microvessels in intact, perfused mouse and rat lungs. Metastatic tumor cells attached to the endothelia of pulmonary pre-capillary arterioles and capillaries. Extravasation of tumor cells was rare, and it seemed that the transmigrated cells were cleared quickly by the lung, leaving only the endothelium-attached cells as the seeds of secondary tumors. Early colonies were entirely within the blood vessels. Although most models of metastasis include an extravasation step early in the process, here we show that in the lung, metastasis is initiated by attachment of tumor cells to the vascular endothelium and that hematogenous metastasis originates from the proliferation of attached intravascular tumor cells rather than from extravasated ones. Intravascular metastasis formation would make early colonies especially vulnerable to intravascular drugs, and this possibility has potential for the prevention of tumor cell attachment to the endothelium.","Al-Mehdi, A B;Tozawa, K;Fisher, A B;Shientag, L;Lee, A;Muschel, R J"
10613832,2000,Nature medicine,"Reduced stability of retinoblastoma protein by gankyrin, an oncogenic ankyrin-repeat protein overexpressed in hepatomas.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in Asia and Africa, where hepatitis virus infection and exposure to specific liver carcinogens are prevalent. Although inactivation of some tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and p16INK4Ahas been identified, no known oncogene is commonly activated in hepatocellular carcinomas. Here we have isolated genes overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas by cDNA subtractive hybridization, and identified an oncoprotein consisting of six ankyrin repeats (gankyrin). The expression of gankyrin was increased in all 34 hepatocellular carcinomas studied. Gankyrin induced anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in NIH/3T3 cells. Gankyrin bound to the product of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1), increasing its phosphorylation and releasing the activity of the transcription factor E2F-1. Gankyrin accelerated the degradation of RB1 in vitro and in vivo, and was identical to or interacted with a subunit of the 26S proteasome. These results demonstrate the importance of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the regulation of cell growth and oncogenic transformation, and indicate that gankyrin overexpression contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis by destabilizing RB1.","Higashitsuji, H;Itoh, K;Nagao, T;Dawson, S;Nonoguchi, K;Kido, T;Mayer, R J;Arii, S;Fujita, J"
10613822,2000,Nature medicine,Signals leading to apoptosis-dependent inhibition of neovascularization by thrombospondin-1.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis that limits vessel density in normal tissues and curtails tumor growth. Here, we show that the inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and the induction of apoptosis by thrombospondin-1 all required the sequential activation of CD36, p59fyn, caspase-3 like proteases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. We also detected increased endothelial cell apoptosis in situ at the margins of tumors in mice treated with thrombospondin-1. These results indicate that thrombospondin-1, and possibly other broad-spectrum natural inhibitors of angiogenesis, act in vivo by inducing receptor-mediated apoptosis in activated microvascular endothelial cells.","Jiménez, B;Volpert, O V;Crawford, S E;Febbraio, M;Silverstein, R L;Bouck, N"
10581086,1999,Nature medicine,Inhibition of angiogenesis by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: insight into mechanisms and implications for cancer growth and ulcer healing.,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillary blood vessels, is essential not only for the growth and metastasis of solid tumors, but also for wound and ulcer healing, because without the restoration of blood flow, oxygen and nutrients cannot be delivered to the healing site. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, indomethacin and ibuprofen are the most widely used drugs for pain, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and, more recently, the prevention of colon cancer and Alzheimer disease. However, NSAIDs produce gastroduodenal ulcers in about 25% of users (often with bleeding and/or perforations) and delay ulcer healing, presumably by blocking prostaglandin synthesis from cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 (ref. 10). The hypothesis that the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs result from inhibition of COX-1, but not COX-2 (ref. 11), prompted the development of NSAIDs that selectively inhibit only COX-2 (such as celecoxib and rofecoxib). Our study demonstrates that both selective and nonselective NSAIDs inhibit angiogenesis through direct effects on endothelial cells. We also show that this action involves inhibition of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK2) activity, interference with ERK nuclear translocation, is independent of protein kinase C and has prostaglandin-dependent and prostaglandin-independent components. Finally, we show that both COX-1 and COX-2 are important for the regulation of angiogenesis. These findings challenge the premise that selective COX-2 inhibitors will not affect the gastrointestinal tract and ulcer/wound healing.","Jones, M K;Wang, H;Peskar, B M;Levin, E;Itani, R M;Sarfeh, I J;Tarnawski, A S"
10546001,1999,Nature medicine,Early involvement of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor transforming gene and fibroblast growth factor expression in prolactinoma pathogenesis.,"Pituitary tumors are commonly encountered, and result from clonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Hypothalamic hormones, local growth factors and circulating sex steroid hormones promote pituitary tumor growth and expansion into large invasive tumors. Estrogen acting directly through its receptor and by stimulation of fibroblast growth factor regulates prolactin synthesis and secretion. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (bFGF) modulates angiogenesis, tumor formation and progression in many tissues, including the anterior pituitary. A pituitary tumor-derived transforming gene (PTTG) has been isolated, which is tumorigenic in vivo, regulates bFGF secretion, and inhibits chromatid separation. The human PTTG family consists of at least three homologous genes, of which PTTG1 is located on chromosome 5q33 and is expressed at low levels in most normal human tissues but is highly expressed in malignant human cell lines and in pituitary tumors. We report here that pituitary pttg is regulated in vivo and in vitro by estrogen. Maximal induction of rat pituitary pttg mRNA in vivo occurred early in pituitary transformation (normal cell to hypertrophic/hyperplastic cell), coincident with bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor induction and pituitary angiogenesis. We also demonstrate that pttg expression is induced by bFGF, and show concordant pttg and bFGF expression in experimental and human pituitary adenomas. As bFGF and estrogen both induce pttg, and pttg expression coincides with the early lactotrophic hyperplastic response, angiogenesis and prolactinoma development, we propose a previously unknown paracrine growth factor-mediated mechanism for pituitary tumor pathogenesis and potentially other estrogen-regulated tumors.","Heaney, A P;Horwitz, G A;Wang, Z;Singson, R;Melmed, S"

We report here that Ptch+/- mice develop primordial follicular neoplasms resembling human trichoblastomas, and that exposure to ultraviolet radiation or ionizing radiation results in an increase in the number and size of these tumors and a shift in their histologic features so that they more closely resemble human basal cell carcinoma. The mouse basal cell carcinomas and trichoblastoma-like tumors resemble human basal cell carcinomas in their loss of normal hemidesmosomal components, presence of p53 mutations, frequent loss of the normal remaining Ptch allele, and activation of hedgehog target gene transcription. The Ptch mutant mice provide the first mouse model, to our knowledge, of ultraviolet and ionizing radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma-like tumors, and also demonstrate that Ptch inactivation and hedgehog target gene activation are essential for basal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis.","Aszterbaum, M;Epstein, J;Oro, A;Douglas, V;LeBoit, P E;Scott, M P;Epstein, E H"

We report here that engagement of CD47, a newly described thrombospondin receptor, by immobilized monoclonal antibody against CD47 or by thrombospondin induced in all B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia clones the cytoplasmic features of apoptosis (cell shrinkage, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and phosphatidylserine externalization) without the nuclear features (chromatin condensation, appearance of single-stranded DNA, DNA fragmentation and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase). These cytoplasmic events of apoptosis were not prevented by the addition of caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, or by the presence of survival factors (such as interleukin-4 and gamma interferon) or cell activation. Morphological studies confirmed the integrity of the nucleus and showed swelling of the mitochondria. This caspase-independent death pathway may be relevant to the development of alternate therapeutic strategies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which remains an incurable disease.","Mateo, V;Lagneaux, L;Bron, D;Biron, G;Armant, M;Delespesse, G;Sarfati, M"

We report here detection of active brain inflammation 3 months after successful inhibition of syngeneic glioma growth. The inflammatory infiltrate consisted of activated macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, and T lymphocytes positive for leucosyalin, CD3 and CD8, and included secondary demyelination. We detected strong widespread herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase immunoreactivity and vector genomes throughout large areas of the brain. Thus, patient evaluation and the design of clinical trials in ongoing and future gene therapy for brain glioblastoma must address not only tumor-killing efficiency, but also long-term active brain inflammation, loss of myelin fibers and persistent transgene expression.","Dewey, R A;Morrissey, G;Cowsill, C M;Stone, D;Bolognani, F;Dodd, N J;Southgate, T D;Klatzmann, D;Lassmann, H;Castro, M G;Löwenstein, P R"

10502827,1999,Nature medicine,Tumor-host interactions in the gallbladder suppress distal angiogenesis and tumor growth: involvement of transforming growth factor beta1.,"Angiogenesis inhibitors produced by a primary tumor can create a systemic anti-angiogenic environment and maintain metastatic tumor cells in a state of dormancy. We show here that the gallbladder microenvironment modulates the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a multifunctional cytokine that functions as an endogenous anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor factor in a cranial window preparation. We found that a wide variety of human gallbladder tumors express TGF-beta1 irrespective of histologic type. We implanted a gel impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor or Mz-ChA-2 tumor in the cranial windows of mice without tumors or mice with subcutaneous or gallbladder tumors to study angiogenesis and tumor growth at a secondary site. Angiogenesis, leukocyte-endothelial interaction in vessels and tumor growth in the cranial window were substantially inhibited in mice with gallbladder tumors. The concentration of TGF-beta1 in the plasma of mice with gallbladder tumors was 300% higher than that in the plasma of mice without tumors or with subcutaneous tumors. In contrast, there was no difference in the plasma levels of other anti- and pro-angiogenic factors. Treatment with neutralizing antibody against TGF-beta1 reversed both angiogenesis suppression and inhibition of leukocyte rolling induced by gallbladder tumors. TGF-beta1 also inhibited Mz-ChA-2 tumor cell proliferation. Our results indicate that the production of anti-angiogenesis/proliferation factors is regulated by tumor-host interactions.","Gohongi, T;Fukumura, D;Boucher, Y;Yun, C O;Soff, G A;Compton, C;Todoroki, T;Jain, R K"
10502821,1999,Nature medicine,Complete molecular remissions induced by patient-specific vaccination plus granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor against lymphoma.,"Lymphomas express a tumor-specific antigen which can be targeted by cancer vaccination. We evaluated the ability of a new idiotype protein vaccine formulation to eradicate residual t(14;18)+ lymphoma cells in 20 patients in a homogeneous, chemotherapy-induced first clinical complete remission. All 11 patients with detectable translocations in their primary tumors had cells from the malignant clone detectable in their blood by PCR both at diagnosis and after chemotherapy, despite being in complete remission. However, 8 of 11 patients converted to lacking cells in their blood from the malignant clone detectable by PCR after vaccination and sustained their molecular remissions. Tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were uniformly found (19 of 20 patients), whereas antibodies were detected, but apparently were not required for molecular remission. Vaccination was thus associated with clearance of residual tumor cells from blood and long-term disease-free survival. The demonstration of molecular remissions, analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes against autologous tumor targets, and addition of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor to the vaccine formulation provide principles relevant to the design of future clinical trials of other cancer vaccines administered in a minimal residual disease setting.","Bendandi, M;Gocke, C D;Kobrin, C B;Benko, F A;Sternas, L A;Pennington, R;Watson, T M;Reynolds, C W;Gause, B L;Duffey, P L;Jaffe, E S;Creekmore, S P;Longo, D L;Kwak, L W"
10502820,1999,Nature medicine,Inhibition of telomerase limits the growth of human cancer cells.,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains the protective structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres. In most human somatic cells, telomerase expression is repressed, and telomeres shorten progressively with each cell division. In contrast, most human tumors express telomerase, resulting in stabilized telomere length. These observations indicate that telomere maintenance is essential to the proliferation of tumor cells. We show here that expression of a mutant catalytic subunit of human telomerase results in complete inhibition of telomerase activity, reduction in telomere length and death of tumor cells. Moreover, expression of this mutant telomerase eliminated tumorigenicity in vivo. These observations demonstrate that disruption of telomere maintenance limits cellular lifespan in human cancer cells, thus validating human telomerase reverse transcriptase as an important target for the development of anti-neoplastic therapies.","Hahn, W C;Stewart, S A;Brooks, M W;York, S G;Eaton, E;Kurachi, A;Beijersbergen, R L;Knoll, J H;Meyerson, M;Weinberg, R A"
10470089,1999,Nature medicine,An association between viral genes and human oncogenic alterations: the adenovirus E1A induces the Ewing tumor fusion transcript EWS-FLI1.,"Malignant transformation of human cells requires the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, such as the activation of oncogenes and loss of function of tumor suppressor genes or those related to genomic instability. Among the genetic alterations most frequently found in human tumors are chromosomal translocations that may result in the expression of chimeric products with transforming capability or are able to change the expression of oncogenes. We show here that the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene can induce a specific human fusion transcript (EWS-FLI1) that is characteristic of Ewing tumors. This fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in normal human fibroblasts and keratinocytes after expression of the adenovirus E1A gene, as well as in human cell lines immortalized by adenoviruses. Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR product showed fusion points between EWS and FLI1 cDNA identical to those detected in Ewing tumors. In addition, we detected a chimeric protein by western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation and a t(11,22) by fluorescent in situ hybridization. This association between a single viral gene and a specific human fusion transcript indicates a direct link between viral genes and chromosome translocations, one of the hallmarks of many human tumors.","Sanchez-Prieto, R;de Alava, E;Palomino, T;Guinea, J;Fernandez, V;Cebrian, S;LLeonart, M;Cabello, P;Martin, P;San Roman, C;Bornstein, R;Pardo, J;Martinez, A;Diaz-Espada, F;Barrios, Y;Ramon y Cajal, S"
10470088,1999,Nature medicine,The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis.,"APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene. Truncating germline and somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur in tumors in FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations. Clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1,250-1,450) indicate, however, that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1,194-1,392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in contrast to other FAP patients, whose 'second hits' tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1,300 providing the greatest advantage. Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1,300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids. APC is not, therefore, a classical tumor suppressor. Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity: if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow.","Lamlum, H;Ilyas, M;Rowan, A;Clark, S;Johnson, V;Bell, J;Frayling, I;Efstathiou, J;Pack, K;Payne, S;Roylance, R;Gorman, P;Sheer, D;Neale, K;Phillips, R;Talbot, I;Bodmer, W;Tomlinson, I"

Here, this activity was shown to interact with complement in a calcium-dependent fashion, and antibody neutralization studies indicated preimmune IgM has a contributing role. Short-term exposure to cyclophosphamide (CPA) partially suppressed this activity in rodents and humans. At longer time points, cyclophosphamide also abrogated neutralizing antibody responses.

10395330,1999,Nature medicine,Mice deficient in tumor necrosis factor-alpha are resistant to skin carcinogenesis.,"Given the associations between chronic inflammation and epithelial cancer, we studied susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis in mice deficient for the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (refs. 5,6). TNF-alpha(-/-) mice were resistant to development of benign and malignant skin tumors, whether induced by initiation with DMBA and promotion with TPA or by repeated dosing with DMBA. TNF-alpha(-/-) mice developed 5-10% the number of tumors developed by wild-type mice during initiation/promotion and 25% of those in wild-type mice after repeated carcinogen treatment. TNF-alpha could influence tumor and stromal cells during tumor development. The early stages of TPA promotion are characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation. These were diminished in TNF-alpha(-/-) mice. TNF-alpha was extensively induced in the epidermis, but not the dermis, in TPA-treated wild-type skin, indicating that dermal inflammation is controlled by keratinocyte TNF-alpha production. Deletion of a TNF-alpha inducible chemokine also conferred some resistance to skin tumor development. TNF-alpha has little influence on later stages of carcinogenesis, as tumors in wild-type and TNF-alpha(-/-) mice had similar rates of malignant progression. These data provide evidence that a pro-inflammatory cytokine is required for de novo carcinogenesis and that TNF-alpha is important to the early stages of tumor promotion. Strategies that neutralize TNF-alpha production may be useful in cancer treatment and prevention.","Moore, R J;Owens, D M;Stamp, G;Arnott, C;Burke, F;East, N;Holdsworth, H;Turner, L;Rollins, B;Pasparakis, M;Kollias, G;Balkwill, F"
10395329,1999,Nature medicine,Cancer therapy using a self-replicating RNA vaccine.,"'Naked' nucleic acid vaccines are potentially useful candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer, but their clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to enhance the immunogenicity of a nucleic acid vaccine by making it 'self-replicating'. We accomplished this by using a gene encoding an RNA replicase polyprotein derived from the Semliki forest virus, in combination with a model antigen. A single intramuscular injection of a self-replicating RNA immunogen elicited antigen-specific antibody and CD8+ T-cell responses at doses as low as 0.1 microg. Pre-immunization with a self-replicating RNA vector protected mice from tumor challenge, and therapeutic immunization prolonged the survival of mice with established tumors. The self-replicating RNA vectors did not mediate the production of substantially more model antigen than a conventional DNA vaccine did in vitro. However, the enhanced efficacy in vivo correlated with a caspase-dependent apoptotic death in transfected cells. This death facilitated the uptake of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells, providing a potential mechanism for enhanced immunogenicity. Naked, non-infectious, self-replicating RNA may be an excellent candidate for the development of new cancer vaccines.","Ying, H;Zaks, T Z;Wang, R F;Irvine, K R;Kammula, U S;Marincola, F M;Leitner, W W;Restifo, N P"
10395328,1999,Nature medicine,Interleukin-4 receptor-directed cytotoxin therapy of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma tumors in xenograft model.,"The elusive and enigmatic origin of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) makes it a complex tumor and therefore difficult to treat. Here we demonstrate that AIDS-KS cells express surface interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptors, and that IL-4 toxin (IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL) is specifically cytotoxic to these cells. Intratumoral, intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of IL-4 toxin in nude mice with established subcutaneous AIDS-KS tumors caused considerable anti-tumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, with highest dose producing durable complete responses. Metabolic changes, including cachexia and lymphopenia, induced by KS tumors were prevented by IL-4 toxin treatment. This report establishes IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL as an experimental therapeutic agent for the treatment of AIDS-KS.","Husain, S R;Kreitman, R J;Pastan, I;Puri, R K"
10395327,1999,Nature medicine,Blockade of the MAP kinase pathway suppresses growth of colon tumors in vivo.,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is thought to be essential in cellular growth and differentiation. Here we report the discovery of a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the upstream kinase MEK that is orally active. Tumor growth was inhibited as much as 80% in mice with colon carcinomas of both mouse and human origin after treatment with this inhibitor. Efficacy was achieved with a wide range of doses with no signs of toxicity, and correlated with a reduction in the levels of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase in excised tumors. These data indicate that MEK inhibitors represent a promising, noncytotoxic approach to the clinical management of colon cancer.","Sebolt-Leopold, J S;Dudley, D T;Herrera, R;Van Becelaere, K;Wiland, A;Gowan, R C;Tecle, H;Barrett, S D;Bridges, A;Przybranowski, S;Leopold, W R;Saltiel, A R"

Here we report the cDNA sequence of the human platelet enzyme, which encodes a unique protein of 543 amino acids, and the identification of highly homologous sequences in activated mouse T cells and in a highly metastatic rat adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the expression of heparanase mRNA in rat tumor cells correlates with their metastatic potential.

10395325,1999,Nature medicine,"Mammalian heparanase: gene cloning, expression and function in tumor progression and metastasis.","Heparan sulfate proteoglycans interact with many extracellular matrix constituents, growth factors and enzymes. Degradation of heparan sulfate by endoglycosidic heparanase cleavage affects a variety of biological processes. We have purified a 50-kDa heparanase from human hepatoma and placenta, and now report cloning of the cDNA and gene encoding this enzyme. Expression of the cloned cDNA in insect and mammalian cells yielded 65-kDa and 50-kDa recombinant heparanase proteins. The 50-kDa enzyme represents an N-terminally processed enzyme, at least 100-fold more active than the 65-kDa form. The heparanase mRNA and protein are preferentially expressed in metastatic cell lines and specimens of human breast, colon and liver carcinomas. Low metastatic murine T-lymphoma and melanoma cells transfected with the heparanase cDNA acquired a highly metastatic phenotype in vivo, reflected by a massive liver and lung colonization. This represents the first cloned mammalian heparanase, to our knowledge, and provides direct evidence for its role in tumor metastasis. Cloning of the heparanase gene enables the development of specific molecular probes for early detection and treatment of cancer metastasis and autoimmune disorders.","Vlodavsky, I;Friedmann, Y;Elkin, M;Aingorn, H;Atzmon, R;Ishai-Michaeli, R;Bitan, M;Pappo, O;Peretz, T;Michal, I;Spector, L;Pecker, I"
10395323,1999,Nature medicine,Conversion of tumor-specific CD4+ T-cell tolerance to T-cell priming through in vivo ligation of CD40.,"Tumor antigen-specific T-cell tolerance limits the efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines. Antigen-presenting cells mediate the induction of T-cell tolerance to self-antigens. We therefore assessed the fate of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells in tumor-bearing recipients after in vivo activation of antigen-presenting cells with antibodies against CD40. Such treatment not only preserved the responsiveness of this population, but resulted in their endogenous activation. Established tumors regressed in vaccinated mice treated with antibody against CD40 at a time when no response was achieved with vaccination alone. These results indicate that modulation of antigen-presenting cells may be a useful strategy for enhancing responsiveness to immunization.","Sotomayor, E M;Borrello, I;Tubb, E;Rattis, F M;Bien, H;Lu, Z;Fein, S;Schoenberger, S;Levitsky, H I"
10395322,1999,Nature medicine,CD40 activation in vivo overcomes peptide-induced peripheral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte tolerance and augments anti-tumor vaccine efficacy.,"The outcome of antigen recognition by naive CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the periphery is orchestrated by CD4+ T-helper cells, and can either lead to priming or tolerization. The presence of T-helper cells favors the induction of CTL immunity, whereas the absence of T-helper cells can result in CTL tolerance. The action of T helper cells in CTL priming is mediated by CD40-CD40 ligand interactions. We demonstrate here that triggering of CD40 in vivo can considerably enhance the efficacy of peptide-based anti-tumor vaccines. The combination of a tolerogenic peptide vaccine containing a minimal essential CTL epitope with an activating antibody against CD40 converts tolerization into strong CTL priming. Moreover, CD40 ligation can provide an already protective tumor-specific peptide vaccine with the capacity to induce therapeutic CTL immunity in tumor-bearing mice. These findings indicate that the CD40-CD40 ligand pair can act as a 'switch', determining whether naive peripheral CTLs are primed or tolerized, and support the clinical use of CD40-stimulating agents as components of anti-cancer vaccines.","Diehl, L;den Boer, A T;Schoenberger, S P;van der Voort, E I;Schumacher, T N;Melief, C J;Offringa, R;Toes, R E"
10371507,1999,Nature medicine,Characterization of circulating T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens in melanoma patients.,"We identified circulating CD8+ T-cell populations specific for the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) MART-1 (27-35) or tyrosinase (368-376) in six of eleven patients with metastatic melanoma using peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. These TAA-specific populations were of two phenotypically distinct types: one, typical for memory/effector T cells; the other, a previously undescribed phenotype expressing both naive and effector cell markers. This latter type represented more than 2% of the total CD8+ T cells in one patient, permitting detailed phenotypic and functional analysis. Although these cells have many of the hallmarks of effector T cells, they were functionally unresponsive, unable to directly lyse melanoma target cells or produce cytokines in response to mitogens. In contrast, CD8+ T cells from the same patient were able to lyse EBV-pulsed target cells and showed robust allogeneic responses. Thus, the clonally expanded TAA-specific population seems to have been selectively rendered anergic in vivo. Peptide stimulation of the TAA-specific T-cell populations in other patients failed to induce substantial upregulation of CD69 expression, indicating that these cells may also have functional defects, leading to blunted activation responses. These data demonstrate that systemic TAA-specific T-cell responses can develop de novo in cancer patients, but that antigen-specific unresponsiveness may explain why such cells are unable to control tumor growth.","Lee, P P;Yee, C;Savage, P A;Fong, L;Brockstedt, D;Weber, J S;Johnson, D;Swetter, S;Thompson, J;Greenberg, P D;Roederer, M;Davis, M M"
10371506,1999,Nature medicine,Ligation of the CD44 adhesion molecule reverses blockage of differentiation in human acute myeloid leukemia.,"Blockage in myeloid differentiation characterizes acute myeloid leukemia (AML); the stage of the blockage defines distinct AML subtypes (AML1/2 to AML5). Differentiation therapy in AML has recently raised interest because the survival of AML3 patients has been greatly improved using the differentiating agent retinoic acid. However, this molecule is ineffective in other AML subtypes. The CD44 surface antigen, on leukemic blasts from most AML patients, is involved in myeloid differentiation. Here, we report that ligation of CD44 with specific anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies or with hyaluronan, its natural ligand, can reverse myeloid differentiation blockage in AML1/2 to AML5 subtypes. The differentiation of AML blasts was evidenced by the ability to produce oxidative bursts, the expression of lineage antigens and cytological modifications, all specific to normal differentiated myeloid cells. These results indicate new possibilities for the development of CD44-targeted differentiation therapy in the AML1/2 to AML5 subtypes.","Charrad, R S;Li, Y;Delpech, B;Balitrand, N;Clay, D;Jasmin, C;Chomienne, C;Smadja-Joffe, F"
10371505,1999,Nature medicine,Extracellular matrix proteins protect small cell lung cancer cells against apoptosis: a mechanism for small cell lung cancer growth and drug resistance in vivo.,"Resistance to chemotherapy is a principal problem in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We show here that SCLC is surrounded by an extensive stroma of extracellular matrix (ECM) at both primary and metastatic sites. Adhesion of SCLC cells to ECM enhances tumorigenicity and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents as a result of beta1 integrin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activation suppressing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. SCLC may create a specialized microenvironment, and the survival of cells bound to ECM could explain the partial responses and local recurrence of SCLC often seen clinically after chemotherapy. Strategies based on blocking beta1 integrin-mediated survival signals may represent a new therapeutic approach to improve the response to chemotherapy in SCLC.","Sethi, T;Rintoul, R C;Moore, S M;MacKinnon, A C;Salter, D;Choo, C;Chilvers, E R;Dransfield, I;Donnelly, S C;Strieter, R;Haslett, C"
10229232,1999,Nature medicine,CD40 antibody evokes a cytotoxic T-cell response that eradicates lymphoma and bypasses T-cell help.,"CD40 is essential in enabling antigen-presenting cells to process and present antigen effectively to T cells. We demonstrate here that when antibody against CD40 is used to treat mice with syngeneic lymphoma, a rapid cytotoxic T-cell response independent of T-helper cells occurs, with tenfold expansion of CD8+ T cells over a period of 5 days. This response eradicates the lymphoma and provides protection against tumor rechallenge without further antibody treatment. Thus, it seems that by treating mice with monoclonal antibody against CD40, we are immunizing against syngeneic tumors. The phenomenon proved reproducible with two antibodies against CD40 (3/23 and FGK-45) in three CD40+ lymphomas (A20, A31 and BCL1) and gave partial protection in one of two CD40- lymphomas (EL4 and Ten1). Although the nature of the target antigens on these lymphomas is unknown, CD8+ T cells recovered from responding mice showed powerful cytotoxic activity against the target B-cell lymphoma in vitro.","French, R R;Chan, H T;Tutt, A L;Glennie, M J"
10202930,1999,Nature medicine,Control of inducible chemoresistance: enhanced anti-tumor therapy through increased apoptosis by inhibition of NF-kappaB.,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) seems to be the principal mechanism whereby anti-oncogenic therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation effect their responses. Resistance to apoptosis, therefore, is probably a principal mechanism whereby tumors are able to overcome these cancer therapies. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is activated by chemotherapy and by irradiation in some cancer cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB in vitro leads to enhanced apoptosis in response to a variety of different stimuli. We show here that inhibition of NF-kappaB through the adenoviral delivery of a modified form of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, sensitizes chemoresistant tumors to the apoptotic potential of TNFalpha and of the chemotherapeutic compound CPT-11, resulting in tumor regression. These results demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB in response to chemotherapy is a principal mechanism of inducible tumor chemoresistance, and establish the inhibition of NF-kappaB as a new approach to adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment.","Wang, C Y;Cusack, J C;Liu, R;Baldwin, A S"

Dendritic cells (DC) 'prime' tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes; thus, we investigated whether DC might also trigger the innate, NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In mice with MHC class I-negative tumors, adoptively transferred- or Flt3 ligand-expanded DC promoted NK cell-dependent anti-tumor effects. In vitro studies demonstrated a cell-to-cell contact between DC and resting NK cells that resulted in a substantial increase in both NK cell cytolytic activity and IFN-gamma production. Thus, DC are involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses.","Fernandez, N C;Lozier, A;Flament, C;Ricciardi-Castagnoli, P;Bellet, D;Suter, M;Perricaudet, M;Tursz, T;Maraskovsky, E;Zitvogel, L"
10086383,1999,Nature medicine,Reduced expression of neural cell adhesion molecule induces metastatic dissemination of pancreatic beta tumor cells.,"As in the development of many human cancers, in a transgenic mouse model of beta-cell carcinogenesis (Rip1Tag2), expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) changes from the 120-kDa isoform in normal tissue to the 140/180-kDa isoforms in tumors. NCAM-deficient RiplTag2 mice, generated by crossing Rip1Tag2 mice with NCAM knockout mice, develop metastases, a tumor stage that is not seen in normal Rip1Tag2 mice. In contrast, overexpression of NCAM 120 in NCAM-deficient Rip1Tag2 mice prevents tumor metastasis. The results indicate that the loss of NCAM-mediated cell adhesion is one rate-limiting step in the actual metastatic dissemination of beta tumor cells.","Perl, A K;Dahl, U;Wilgenbus, P;Cremer, H;Semb, H;Christofori, G"
10086382,1999,Nature medicine,A mechanism for hormone-independent prostate cancer through modulation of androgen receptor signaling by the HER-2/neu tyrosine kinase.,"Prostate cancer progresses from a hormone-sensitive, androgen-dependent stage to a hormone-refractory, androgen-independent tumor. The androgen receptor pathway functions in these androgen-independent tumors despite anti-androgen therapy. In our LAPC-4 prostate cancer model, androgen-independent sublines expressed higher levels of the HER-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase than their androgen-dependent counterparts. Forced overexpression of HER-2/neu in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells allowed ligand-independent growth. HER-2/neu activated the androgen receptor pathway in the absence of ligand and synergized with low levels of androgen to 'superactivate' the pathway. By modulating the response to low doses of androgen, a tyrosine kinase receptor can restore androgen receptor function to prostate cancer cells, a finding directly related to the clinical progression of prostate cancer.","Craft, N;Shostak, Y;Carey, M;Sawyers, C L"
10086381,1999,Nature medicine,Modulation of oncogenic potential by alternative gene use in human prostate cancer.,"Only a small percentage of primary prostate cancers have genetic changes. In contrast, nearly 90% of clinically significant human prostate cancers seems to express high levels of the nuclear phosphoprotein pp32 by in situ hybridization. Because pp32 inhibits oncogene-mediated transformation, we investigated its paradoxical expression in cancer by comparing the sequence and function of pp32 species from paired benign prostate tissue and adjacent prostatic carcinoma from three patients. Here we demonstrate that pp32 is expressed in benign prostatic tissue, but pp32r1 and pp32r2, closely-related genes located on different chromosomes, are expressed in prostate cancer. Although pp32 is a tumor suppressor, pp32r1 and pp32r2 are tumorigenic. Alternative use of the pp32, pp32r1 and pp32r2 genes may modulate the oncogenic potential of human prostate cancer.","Kadkol, S S;Brody, J R;Pevsner, J;Bai, J;Pasternack, G R"
9930872,1999,Nature medicine,An essential part for Rho-associated kinase in the transcellular invasion of tumor cells.,"Adhesion of tumor cells to host cell layers and subsequent transcellular migration are pivotal steps in cancer invasion and metastasis. The small GTPase Rho controls cell adhesion and motility through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulation of actomyosin contractility. Cultured rat MM1 hepatoma cells migrate through a mesothelial cell monolayer in vitro in a serum-dependent, Rho-mediated manners. Among several proteins isolated as putative target molecules of Rho, the ROCK (ROK) family of Rho-associated serine-threonine protein kinases are thought to participate in the induction of focal adhesions and stress fibers in cultured cells, and to mediate calcium sensitization of smooth muscle contraction by enhancing phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin. Transfection of MM1 cells with cDNA encoding a dominant active mutant of ROCK conferred invasive activity independently of serum and Rho. In contrast, expression of a dominant negative, kinase-defective ROCK mutant substantially attenuated the invasive phenotype. A specific ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) blocked both Rho-mediated activation of actomyosin and invasive activity of these cells. Furthermore, continuous delivery of this inhibitor using osmotic pumps considerably reduced the dissemination of MM1 cells implanted into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic rats. These results indicate that ROCK plays an essential part in tumor cell invasion, and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic target for the prevention of cancer invasion and metastasis.","Itoh, K;Yoshioka, K;Akedo, H;Uehata, M;Ishizaki, T;Narumiya, S"
9846573,1998,Nature medicine,p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor regulate tumor growth of NOS2-expressing human carcinoma cells.,"The finding of frequent nitric oxide synthase expression in human cancers indicates that nitric oxide has a pathophysiological role in carcinogenesis. To determine the role of nitric oxide in tumor progression, we generated human carcinoma cell lines that produced nitric oxide constitutively. Cancer cells expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase that had wild-type p53 had reduced tumor growth in athymic nude mice, whereas those with mutated p53 had accelerated tumor growth associated with increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression and neovascularization. Our data indicate that tumor-associated nitric oxide production may promote cancer progression by providing a selective growth advantage to tumor cells with mutant p53, and that inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase may have therapeutic activity in these tumors.","Ambs, S;Merriam, W G;Ogunfusika, M O;Bennett, W P;Ishibe, N;Hussain, S P;Tzeng, E E;Geller, D A;Billiar, T R;Harris, C C"

9809559,1998,Nature medicine,Tumor-specific killer cells in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.,"Models for immune-mediated tumor regression in mice have defined an essential role for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs); however, naturally occurring tumor immunity in humans is poorly understood. Patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) provide an opportunity to explore the mechanisms underlying tumor immunity to breast and ovarian cancer. Although tumor immunity and autoimmune neuronal degeneration in PCD correlates with a specific antibody response to the tumor and brain antigen cdr2, this humoral response has not been shown to be pathogenic. Here we present evidence for a specific cellular immune response in PCD patients. We have detected expanded populations of MHC class I-restricted cdr2-specific CTLs in the blood of 3/3 HLA-A2.1+ PCD patients, providing the first description, to our knowledge, of tumor-specific CTLs using primary human cells in a simple recall assay. Cross-presentation of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells also led to a potent CTL response. These results indicate a model whereby immature dendritic cells that engulf apoptotic tumor cells can mature and migrate to draining lymph organs where they could induce a CTL response to tissue-restricted antigens. In PCD, peripheral activation of cdr2-specific CTLs is likely to contribute to the subsequent development of the autoimmune neuronal degeneration.","Albert, M L;Darnell, J C;Bender, A;Francisco, L M;Bhardwaj, N;Darnell, R B"
9809552,1998,Nature medicine,DNA vaccines with single-chain Fv fused to fragment C of tetanus toxin induce protective immunity against lymphoma and myeloma.,"Vaccination with idiotypic protein protects against B-cell lymphoma, mainly through anti-idiotypic antibody. For use in patients, DNA vaccines containing single-chain Fv derived from tumor provide a convenient alternative vaccine delivery system. However, single-chain Fv sequence alone induces low anti-idiotypic response and poor protection against lymphoma. Fusion of the gene encoding fragment C of tetanus toxin to single-chain Fv substantially promotes the anti-idiotypic response and induces strong protection against B-cell lymphoma. The same fusion design also induces protective immunity against a surface Ig-negative myeloma. These findings indicate that fusion to a pathogen sequence allows a tumor antigen to engage diverse immune mechanisms that suppress growth. This fusion design has the added advantage of overcoming potential tolerance to tumor that may exist in patients.","King, C A;Spellerberg, M B;Zhu, D;Rice, J;Sahota, S S;Thompsett, A R;Hamblin, T J;Radl, J;Stevenson, F K"

We observed LOI of the insulin-like growth factor-II gene in twelve of twenty-seven informative colorectal cancer patients (44%), as well as in the matched normal colonic mucosa of the patients with LOI in their cancers, and in peripheral blood samples of four patients. Ten of eleven cancers (91%) with microsatellite instability showed LOI, compared with only two of sixteen tumors (12%) without microsatellite instability (P < 0.001). Control patients without cancer showed LOI in colonic mucosa of only two of sixteen cases (12%, P < 0.001) and two of fifteen blood samples (13%, P < 0.001). These data suggest that LOI in tumor and normal tissue identifies most colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite instability in their tumors, and that LO! may identify an important subset of the population with cancer or at risk of developing cancer.","Cui, H;Horon, I L;Ohlsson, R;Hamilton, S R;Feinberg, A P"

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), CD4-lymphocyteS, chemokine and/or antibody responses have all been associated with protection against HIV and AIDS; however, effective and safe vaccination strategies remain elusive. Here we show that vaccination with a minimal ovine CTL peptide epitope identified within gp51 of the retrovirus bovine leukemia virus (BLV), consistently induced peptide-specific CTLs. Only sheep whose CTLs were also capable of recognizing retrovirus-infected cells were fully protected when challenged with BLV. This retrovirus displays limited sequence variation; thus, in the relative absence of confounding CTL escape variants, virus-specific CTLs targeting a single epitope were able to prevent the establishment of a latent retroviral infection.","Hislop, A D;Good, M F;Mateo, L;Gardner, J;Gatei, M H;Daniel, R C;Meyers, B V;Lavin, M F;Suhrbier, A"
9734402,1998,Nature medicine,The core protein of hepatitis C virus induces hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the main cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide. Chronic hepatitis ultimately results in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in chronic HCV infection is still unclear. The ability of the core protein of HCV to modulate gene transcription, cell proliferation and cell death may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Here, we report the development of HCC in two independent lines of mice transgenic for the HCV core gene, which develop hepatic steatosis early in life as a histological feature characteristic of chronic hepatitis C. After the age of 16 months, mice of both lines developed hepatic tumors that first appeared as adenomas containing fat droplets in the cytoplasm. Then HCC, a more poorly-differentiated neoplasia, developed from within the adenomas, presenting in a 'nodule-in-nodule' manner without cytoplasmic fat droplets; this closely resembled the histopathological characteristics of the early stage of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C. These results indicate that the HCV core protein has a chief role in the development of HCC, and that these transgenic mice provide good animal models for determining the molecular events in hepatocarcinogenesis with HCV infection.","Moriya, K;Fujie, H;Shintani, Y;Yotsuyanagi, H;Tsutsumi, T;Ishibashi, K;Matsuura, Y;Kimura, S;Miyamura, T;Koike, K"
9734401,1998,Nature medicine,Suppression of caveolin expression induces androgen sensitivity in metastatic androgen-insensitive mouse prostate cancer cells.,"Although prostate cancer cells are often initially sensitive to androgen ablation, they eventually lose this response and continue to survive, grow and spread in the absence of androgenic steroids. The mechanism(s) that underlie resistance to androgen ablation therapy remain mostly unknown. We have demonstrated that elevated caveolin protein levels are associated with human prostate cancer progression in pathological specimens. Here we show that suppression of caveolin expression by a stably transfected antisense caveolin-1 cDNA vector converted androgen-insensitive metastatic mouse prostate cancer cells to an androgen-sensitive phenotype. Orthotopically grown tumors and low-density cell cultures derived from antisense caveolin clones had increased apoptosis in the absence of androgenic steroids, whereas similarly grown tumors and cells from vector (control) clones and parental cells were not sensitive to androgens. Studies using a representative antisense caveolin clone showed that selection for androgen resistance in vivo correlated with increased caveolin levels, and that adenovirus-mediated caveolin expression blocked androgen sensitivity. Our results identify a new candidate gene for hormone-resistant prostate cancer in man and indicate that androgen insensitivity can be an inherent property of metastatic prostate cancer.","Nasu, Y;Timme, T L;Yang, G;Bangma, C H;Li, L;Ren, C;Park, S H;DeLeon, M;Wang, J;Thompson, T C"

The molecular mechanism by which dietary lipids promote tumorigenesis is unknown. Their effects may be mediated at least in part by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). These ligand-activated nuclear receptors modulate gene expression in response to fatty acids, lipid-derived metabolites and antidiabetic drugs. To explore the role of the PPARs in diet-induced carcinogenesis, we treated mice predisposed to intestinal neoplasia with a synthetic PPARgamma ligand. Reflecting the pattern of expression of PPARgamma in the gastrointestinal tract, treated mice developed a considerably greater number of polyps in the colon but not in the small intestine, indicating that PPARgamma activation may provide a molecular link between a high-fat diet and increased risk of colorectal cancer.","Saez, E;Tontonoz, P;Nelson, M C;Alvarez, J G;Ming, U T;Baird, S M;Thomazy, V A;Evans, R M"
9734399,1998,Nature medicine,Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma promotes the development of colon tumors in C57BL/6J-APCMin/+ mice.,"The development of colorectal cancer, one of the most frequent cancers, is influenced by prostaglandins and fatty acids. Decreased prostaglandin production, seen in mice with mutations in the cyclooxygenase 2 gene or in animals and humans treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, prevents or attenuates colon cancer development. There is also a strong correlation between the intake of fatty acids from animal origin and colon cancer. Therefore, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a downstream transcriptional mediator for prostaglandins and fatty acids which is highly expressed in the colon may be involved in this process. Activation of PPARgamma by two different synthetic agonists increased the frequency and size of colon tumors in C57BL/6J-APCMin/+ mice, an animal model susceptible to intestinal neoplasia. Tumor frequency was only increased in the colon, and did not change in the small intestine, coinciding with the colon-restricted expression of PPARgamma. Treatment with PPARgamma agonists increased beta-catenin levels both in the colon of C57BL/61-APCMin/+ mice and in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Genetic abnormalities in the Wnt/wingless/APC pathway, which enhance the transcriptional activity of the beta-catenin-T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor 1 transcription complex, often underly the development of colon tumors. Our data indicate that PPARgamma activation modifies the development of colon tumors in C57BL/61-APCMin/+ mice.","Lefebvre, A M;Chen, I;Desreumaux, P;Najib, J;Fruchart, J C;Geboes, K;Briggs, M;Heyman, R;Auwerx, J"

We show here that PPARgamma is expressed at high levels in both well- and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, in normal colonic mucosa and in human colon cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of this receptor in colon cancer cells causes a considerable reduction in linear and clonogenic growth, increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and the reversal of many gene expression events specifically associated with colon cancer. Transplantable tumors derived from human colon cancer cells show a significant reduction of growth when mice are treated with troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand. These results indicate that the growth and differentiation of colon cancer cells can be modulated through PPARgamma.","Sarraf, P;Mueller, E;Jones, D;King, F J;DeAngelo, D J;Partridge, J B;Holden, S A;Chen, L B;Singer, S;Fletcher, C;Spiegelman, B M"

9701243,1998,Nature medicine,The involvement of calpain-dependent proteolysis of the tumor suppressor NF2 (merlin) in schwannomas and meningiomas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) protein, also known as merlin or schwannomin, is a tumor suppressor, and NF2 is mutated in most schwannomas and meningiomas. Although these tumors are dependent on NF2, some lack detectable NF2 mutations, which indicates that alternative mechanisms exist for inactivating merlin. Here, we demonstrate cleavage of merlin by the ubiquitous protease calpain and considerable activation of the calpain system resulting in the loss of merlin expression in these tumors. Increased proteolysis of merlin by calpain in some schwannomas and meningiomas exemplifies tumorigenesis linked to the calpain-mediated proteolytic pathway.","Kimura, Y;Koga, H;Araki, N;Mugita, N;Fujita, N;Takeshima, H;Nishi, T;Yamashima, T;Saido, T C;Yamasaki, T;Moritake, K;Saya, H;Nakao, M"
9701242,1998,Nature medicine,Thrombin receptor overexpression in malignant and physiological invasion processes.,"Although the involvement of soluble and matrix-immobilized proteases in tumor cell invasion and metastasis is well recognized, the role of proteolytically activated cell surface receptors has not been elucidated. We report here that thrombin receptor, a member of the protease-activated receptor family, is preferentially expressed in highly metastatic human breast carcinoma cell lines and breast carcinoma biopsy specimens. Introduction of thrombin receptor antisense cDNA considerably inhibited the invasion of metastatic breast carcinoma cells in culture through a reconstituted basement membrane. During placental implantation of the human embryo, thrombin receptor is transiently expressed in the invading cytotrophoblasts. These results emphasize the involvement of thrombin receptor in cell invasion associated with tumor progression and normal embryonic development.","Even-Ram, S;Uziely, B;Cohen, P;Grisaru-Granovsky, S;Maoz, M;Ginzburg, Y;Reich, R;Vlodavsky, I;Bar-Shavit, R"
9662379,1998,Nature medicine,Tissue microarrays for high-throughput molecular profiling of tumor specimens.,"Many genes and signalling pathways controlling cell proliferation, death and differentiation, as well as genomic integrity, are involved in cancer development. New techniques, such as serial analysis of gene expression and cDNA microarrays, have enabled measurement of the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment, revealing many new, potentially important cancer genes. These genome screening tools can comprehensively survey one tumor at a time; however, analysis of hundreds of specimens from patients in different stages of disease is needed to establish the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic importance of each of the emerging cancer gene candidates. Here we have developed an array-based high-throughput technique that facilitates gene expression and copy number surveys of very large numbers of tumors. As many as 1000 cylindrical tissue biopsies from individual tumors can be distributed in a single tumor tissue microarray. Sections of the microarray provide targets for parallel in situ detection of DNA, RNA and protein targets in each specimen on the array, and consecutive sections allow the rapid analysis of hundreds of molecular markers in the same set of specimens. Our detection of six gene amplifications as well as p53 and estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer demonstrates the power of this technique for defining new subgroups of tumors.","Kononen, J;Bubendorf, L;Kallioniemi, A;Bärlund, M;Schraml, P;Leighton, S;Torhorst, J;Mihatsch, M J;Sauter, G;Kallioniemi, O P"
9623981,1998,Nature medicine,Idiotypic immunization induces immunity to mutated p53 and tumor rejection.,"The p53 molecule might serve as a common tumor-associated antigen, as the tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated and the p53 protein is often over-expressed in tumor cells. We report that effective immunity to p53 can be induced through an idiotypic network by immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (PAb-240) specific for mutated p53, or with a peptide derived from the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the variable domain of the light chain (VL) of this antibody. The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.","Ruiz, P J;Wolkowicz, R;Waisman, A;Hirschberg, D L;Carmi, P;Erez, N;Garren, H;Herkel, J;Karpuj, M;Steinman, L;Rotter, V;Cohen, I R"
9623977,1998,Nature medicine,Overexpression of E2F-1 in glioma triggers apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.,"The transfer of apoptosis genes to tumors is one of the most promising strategies for cancer gene therapy. We have shown that massive apoptosis occurs when wild-type p53 expression is induced in glioma cells carrying a p53 gene mutation. However, adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer is ineffective in causing apoptosis in glioma cells that retain a wild-type p53 genotype. We evaluated the effect of E2F-1 overexpression on the growth of gliomas in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro study, the adenovirus-mediated transfer of exogenous E2F-1 protein precipitated generalized apoptosis in gliomas. The treatment with Ad5CMV-E2F-1 of nude mice carrying subcutaneous gliomas arrested tumor growth. Our results indicate that E2F-1 has anti-glioma activity in vitro and in vivo.","Fueyo, J;Gomez-Manzano, C;Yung, W K;Liu, T J;Alemany, R;McDonnell, T J;Shi, X;Rao, J S;Levin, V A;Kyritsis, A P"
9585241,1998,Nature medicine,B cells inhibit induction of T cell-dependent tumor immunity.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated tumor immunity against major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) class I-positive but class II-negative tumors often requires help from CD4+ T cells. These CD4 cells are activated by MHC class II-positive cells that present tumor derived antigens. Considering that different antigen presenting cells, such as B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells compete for antigen and influence the outcome of an immune response, we analyzed tumor immunity in B cell-deficient mice. These mice appear normal with regard to T cell immunity and tolerance to some pure foreign antigens. We show here that the low immunogenicity of tumors is caused by B cells whose presence in the priming phase results in disabled CD4+ T cell help for CTL mediated tumor immunity. Instead, in the presence of B cells, a non-protective humoral immune response is induced. Our results may explain the enigmatic observation that tumor-reactive antibodies occur frequently in cancer patients.","Qin, Z;Richter, G;Schüler, T;Ibe, S;Cao, X;Blankenstein, T"
9585240,1998,Nature medicine,Detection of tumor angiogenesis in vivo by alphaVbeta3-targeted magnetic resonance imaging.,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a requirement for malignant tumor growth and metastasis. In the absence of angiogenesis, local tumor expansion is suppressed at a few millimeters and cells lack routes for distant hematogenous spread. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the degree of angiogenesis is correlated with the malignant potential of several cancers, including breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Moreover, the expression of a specific angiogenesis marker, the endothelial integrin alphaVbeta3, has been shown to correlate with tumor grade. However, studies of tumor angiogenesis such as these have generally relied on invasive procedures, adequate tissue sampling and meticulous estimation of histologic microvessel density. In the present report, we describe a novel approach to detecting angiogenesis in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a paramagnetic contrast agent targeted to endothelial alphaVbeta3 via the LM609 monoclonal antibody. This approach provided enhanced and detailed imaging of rabbit carcinomas by directly targeting paramagnetic agents to the angiogenic vasculature. In addition, angiogenic 'hot spots' not seen by standard MRI were detected. Our strategy for MR imaging of alphaVbeta3 thus represents a non-invasive means to assess the growth and malignant phenotype of tumors.","Sipkins, D A;Cheresh, D A;Kazemi, M R;Nevin, L M;Bednarski, M D;Li, K C"
9585239,1998,Nature medicine,Rhabdomyosarcomas and radiation hypersensitivity in a mouse model of Gorlin syndrome.,"Gorlin (or nevoid basal cell carcinoma) syndrome is characterized by a variety of clinical problems including generalized overgrowth of the body, cysts, developmental abnormalities of the skeleton and a predisposition to benign and malignant tumors. The syndrome results from germline mutations of the human homolog of the drosophila segment polarity gene patched (ptc). Here we report that mice heterozygous for ptc develop many of the features characteristic of Gorlin syndrome and that they exhibit a high incidence of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children. The downstream signalling partner of ptc, gli1, was overexpressed in all RMSs analyzed, indicating that abnormal signalling of the ptc-gli1 pathway may be common for the various tumors associated with the syndrome. igf2, implicated in the formation of RMSs, was also overexpressed, suggesting cross-talk between the ptc and igf2 pathways in tumorigenesis. Developmental defects in Gorlin syndrome resemble those induced by ionizing radiation. We show that ptc heterozygous mice exhibit increased incidence of radiation-induced teratogenesis. This suggests a role for ptc in the response to ionizing radiation and provides a model for both the systemic (developmental) and stochastic (cancer) abnormalities observed in Gorlin syndrome.","Hahn, H;Wojnowski, L;Zimmer, A M;Hall, J;Miller, G;Zimmer, A"

Here, we show that DCs secrete antigen presenting vesicles, called exosomes, which express functional Major Histocompatibility Complex class I and class II, and T-cell costimulatory molecules. Tumor peptide-pulsed DC-derived exosomes prime specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo and eradicate or suppress growth of established murine tumors in a T cell-dependent manner.

9585232,1998,Nature medicine,Tumor immunogenicity is determined by the mechanism of cell death via induction of heat shock protein expression.,"In situ killing of tumor cells using suicide gene transfer to generate death by a non-apoptotic pathway was associated with high immunogenicity and induction of heat shock protein (hsp) expression. In contrast, a syngeneic colorectal tumor line, CMT93, killed predominantly by apoptosis, showed low levels of hsp expression and less immunogenicity. When apoptosis was inhibited in CMT93 cells by overexpression of bcl-2, hsp was also induced. Furthermore, when cDNA encoding hsp70 was stably transfected into B16 and CMT93 cells, its expression significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of both tumors. Increased levels of hsp, induced by non-apoptotic cell killing, may provide an immunostimulatory signal in vivo which helps break tolerance to tumor antigens. These findings have important implications for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies aimed at promoting patients' immune responses to their own tumors.","Melcher, A;Todryk, S;Hardwick, N;Ford, M;Jacobson, M;Vile, R G"
9546789,1998,Nature medicine,Deregulation of cell growth by the K1 gene of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,"At a position equivalent to the gene encoding the saimiri transforming protein (STP) of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) contains a distinct open reading frame called K1. Although KSHV and HVS are related members of the rhadinovirus subgroup of gamma herpesviruses, K1 and STP exhibit no similarity in amino acid sequence or in structural organization. Since STP is required for the oncogenic potential of HVS, we investigated the functional consequence of K1 expression. Expression of the K1 gene in rodent fibroblasts produced morphologic changes and focus formation indicative of transformation. A recombinant herpesvirus in which the STP oncogene of HVS was replaced with K1, immortalized primary T lymphocytes to IL-2 independent growth and induced lymphoma in common marmosets. These results demonstrate the transforming potential of the K1 gene of KSHV.","Lee, H;Veazey, R;Williams, K;Li, M;Guo, J;Neipel, F;Fleckenstein, B;Lackner, A;Desrosiers, R C;Jung, J U"
9546785,1998,Nature medicine,Evidence for the involvement of endothelial cell integrin alphaVbeta3 in the disruption of the tumor vasculature induced by TNF and IFN-gamma.,"Administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) to melanoma patients causes selective disruption of the tumor vasculature but the mechanism of this disruption is unknown. Here we report that exposure of human endothelial cells to TNF and IFN-gamma results in a reduced activation of integrin alphaVbeta3, an adhesion receptor that plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis, leading to a decreased alphaVbeta3-dependent endothelial cell adhesion and survival. Detachment and apoptosis of angiogenic endothelial cells was demonstrated in vivo in melanoma metastases of patients treated with TNF and IFN-gamma. These results implicate integrin alphaVbeta3 in the anti-vascular activity of TNF and IFN-gamma and demonstrate a new mechanism by which cytokines control cell adhesion.","Rüegg, C;Yilmaz, A;Bieler, G;Bamat, J;Chaubert, P;Lejeune, F J"
9500607,1998,Nature medicine,Vaccination of melanoma patients with peptide- or tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells.,"Melanoma is the main cause of death in patients with skin cancer. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) attack melanoma cells in an HLA-restricted and tumor antigen-specific manner. Several melanoma-associated tumor antigens have been identified. These antigens are suitable candidates for a vaccination therapy of melanoma. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) specialized for the induction of a primary T-cell response. Mouse studies have demonstrated the potent capacity of DCs to induce antitumor immunity. In the present clinical pilot study, DCs were generated in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) and were pulsed with tumor lysate or a cocktail of peptides known to be recognized by CTLs, depending on the patient's HLA haplotype. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was added as a CD4 helper antigen and immunological tracer molecule. Sixteen patients with advanced melanoma were immunized on an outpatient basis. Vaccination was well tolerated. No physical sign of autoimmunity was detected in any of the patients. DC vaccination induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity toward KLH in all patients, as well as a positive DTH reaction to peptide-pulsed DCs in 11 patients. Recruitment of peptide-specific CTLs to the DTH challenge site was also demonstrated. Therefore, antigen-specific immunity was induced during DC vaccination. Objective responses were evident in 5 out of 16 evaluated patients (two complete responses, three partial responses) with regression of metastases in various organs (skin, soft tissue, lung, pancreas) and one additional minor response. These data indicate that vaccination with autologous DCs generated from peripheral blood is a safe and promising approach in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and impact on the survival of melanoma patients.","Nestle, F O;Alijagic, S;Gilliet, M;Sun, Y;Grabbe, S;Dummer, R;Burg, G;Schadendorf, D"

On the basis of immunologic assays, 91% of patients could be successfully immunized with this synthetic peptide, and 13 of 31 patients (42%) receiving the peptide vaccine plus IL-2 had objective cancer responses, and four additional patients had mixed or minor responses.

A number of chemotherapeutic agents have been shown recently to act by inducing apoptosis, a type of cell death antagonized by the bcl-2 gene. Human melanoma expresses Bcl-2 in up to 90% of all cases. In the present study we demonstrate that bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment improves the chemosensitivity of human melanoma grown in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Our findings suggest that reduction of Bcl-2 in melanoma, and possibly also in a variety of other tumors, may be a novel and rational approach to improve chemosensitivity and treatment outcome.","Jansen, B;Schlagbauer-Wadl, H;Brown, B D;Bryan, R N;van Elsas, A;Müller, M;Wolff, K;Eichler, H G;Pehamberger, H"

We report that NEP expression and catalytic activity are lost in vitro in androgen-independent but not androgen-dependent PC cell lines. In vivo, NEP protein expression is commonly decreased in cancer cells of metastatic PC specimens from patients with androgen-independent but not androgen-dependent PC. Overexpression of NEP in androgen-independent PC cells or incubation with recombinant NEP inhibits PC cell growth. Furthermore, in androgen-dependent PC cells, expression of NEP is transcriptionally regulated by androgen and decreases with androgen withdrawal. These data suggest that decreased NEP expression, common in androgen-independent PCs, is facilitated by the elimination of androgens, and that NEP loss plays an important role in the development of androgen-independent PC by allowing PC cells to use mitogenic neuropeptides as an alternate source to androgen in order to stimulate cell proliferation.","Papandreou, C N;Usmani, B;Geng, Y;Bogenrieder, T;Freeman, R;Wilk, S;Finstad, C L;Reuter, V E;Powell, C T;Scheinberg, D;Magill, C;Scher, H I;Albino, A P;Nanus, D M"

Physiological barriers to delivering proteins to tumor and surrounding infiltrated brain were circumvented with high-flow interstitial microinfusion. At least a 50% reduction in tumor volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) occurred in 9 of 15 patients who could be evaluated (60%), including two complete responses. Peritumoral toxicity developed 1-4 weeks after treatment in three of three patients at 1.0 microg/ml, but in zero of nine patients treated at lower concentrations. No symptomatic systemic toxicity occurred. Regional perfusion with Tf-CRM107 produces tumor responses without systemic toxicity in patients with malignant brain tumors refractory to conventional therapy. Direct interstitial infusion can be used successfully to distribute a large protein in the tumor and infiltrated brain surrounding the tumor.","Laske, D W;Youle, R J;Oldfield, E H"

We evaluated this approach in 15 patients with progressive growth of recurrent malignant brain tumors. Antitumor activity was detected in five of the smaller tumors (1.4 +/- 0.5 ml). In situ hybridization for HSV-TK demonstrated survival of vector-producing cells (VPCs) at 7 days but indicated limited gene transfer to tumors, suggesting that indirect, ""bystander,"" mechanisms provide local antitumor activity in human tumors. However, the response of only very small tumors in which a high density of vector-producing cells had been placed suggests that techniques to improve delivery and distribution of the therapeutic gene will need to be developed if clinical utility is to be achieved with this approach.","Ram, Z;Culver, K W;Oshiro, E M;Viola, J J;DeVroom, H L;Otto, E;Long, Z;Chiang, Y;McGarrity, G J;Muul, L M;Katz, D;Blaese, R M;Oldfield, E H"
9359705,1997,Nature medicine,Increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs and decreased inflammatory response in mice lacking the multidrug resistance-associated protein.,"The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) mediates the cellular excretion of many drugs, glutathione S-conjugates (GS-X) of lipophilic xenobiotics and endogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes. Increased MRP levels in tumor cells can cause multidrug resistance (MDR) by decreasing the intracellular drug concentration. The physiological role or roles of MRP remain ill-defined, however. We have generated MRP-deficient mice by using embryonic stem cell technology. Mice homozygous for the mrp mutant allele, mrp-/-, are viable and fertile, but their response to an inflammatory stimulus is impaired. We attribute this defect to a decreased secretion of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from leukotriene-synthesizing cells. Moreover, the mrp-/- mice are hypersensitive to the anticancer drug etoposide. The phenotype of mrp-/- mice is consistent with a role for MRP as the main LTC4-exporter in leukotriene-synthesizing cells, and as an important drug exporter in drug-sensitive cells. Our results suggest that this ubiquitous GS-X pump is dispensable in mice, making treatment of MDR with MRP-specific reversal agents potentially feasible.","Wijnholds, J;Evers, R;van Leusden, M R;Mol, C A;Zaman, G J;Mayer, U;Beijnen, J H;van der Valk, M;Krimpenfort, P;Borst, P"
9359704,1997,Nature medicine,Evidence for an alternative mechanism for maintaining telomere length in human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines.,"The gradual loss of DNA from the ends of telomeres has been implicated in the control of cellular proliferative potential. Telomerase is an enzyme that restores telomeric DNA sequences, and expression of its activity was thought to be essential for the immortalization of human cells, both in vitro and in tumor progression in vivo. Telomerase activity has been detected in 50-100% of tumors of different types, but not in most normal adult somatic tissues. It has also been detected in about 70% of human cell lines immortalized in vitro and in all tumor-derived cell lines examined to date. It has previously been shown that in vitro immortalized telomerase-negative cell lines acquire very long and heterogeneous telomeres in association with immortalization presumably via one or more novel telomere-lengthening mechanisms that we refer to as ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). Here we report evidence for the presence of ALT in a subset of tumor-derived cell lines and tumors. The maintenance of telomeres by a mechanism other than telomerase, even in a minority of cancers, has major implications for therapeutic uses of telomerase inhibitors.","Bryan, T M;Englezou, A;Dalla-Pozza, L;Dunham, M A;Reddel, R R"
9359703,1997,Nature medicine,A novel protein that participates in nonself discrimination of malignant cells by homologous complement.,"The human complement (C) system protects an individual against substances of nonself origin, including xenografts and microbial pathogens. Human cells express C-regulatory proteins, CD46 and CD55, thereby circumventing attack by C3, a major effector of C. Nevertheless, certain malignant cells, particularly those undergoing apoptotic stress, can activate homologous C, overcoming the regulatory actions of CD46 and/or CD55. The molecular mechanisms whereby malignant cells are tagged by homologous C3 remain largely unknown. We identified a novel gene product that converts human cells into targets for homologous complement. Only malignant cells and cell lines exposed to Fas or X-irradiation stimuli produced this protein, designated M161Ag, which was an unglycosylated 43-kDa protein. Analysis of cloned cDNAs indicated that this molecule was a secretory protein containing five amino acids encoded by TGA codons. Its functions were unique in that once secreted from the tumor cells, it bound back to the surface of these cells and activated homologous complement (C3) via the alternative pathway, allowing for C3 deposition on the membrane. This molecule may offer new insight into innate immunity; surveillance of tumor cells by complement is a common feature in the human immune system.","Matsumoto, M;Takeda, J;Inoue, N;Hara, T;Hatanaka, M;Takahashi, K;Nagasawa, S;Akedo, H;Seya, T"
9359699,1997,Nature medicine,HIV-1 induction of CD40 on endothelial cells promotes the outgrowth of AIDS-associated B-cell lymphomas.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is associated with the development of aggressive extranodal B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Using microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC)-enriched bone marrow stromal cultures, HIV infection of stromal MVECs from lymphoma patients induced the outgrowth of malignant B cells. MVECs were the only HIV-infected cells in the stroma, and purified brain MVECs also induced a phenotype supportive of neoplastic B-cell attachment and proliferation. HIV infection of MVECs stimulated surface expression of CD40 and allowed preferential induction of the vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 after CD40 triggering. B-lymphoma cells expressed the CD40 ligand (CD40L), and blocking of CD40-CD40L interactions between HIV-infected MVECs and B-lymphoma cells inhibited B-cell attachment and proliferation. These observations suggest that HIV promotes B-lymphoma cell growth through facilitating attachment of lymphoma cells to HIV-infected MVECs and represent a novel mechanism through which viruses may induce malignancies.","Moses, A V;Williams, S E;Strussenberg, J G;Heneveld, M L;Ruhl, R A;Bakke, A C;Bagby, G C;Nelson, J A"
9359698,1997,Nature medicine,Antioxidants enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in colorectal cancer: a p53-independent induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 via C/EBPbeta.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Five-fluorouracil (5FU) remains the single most effective treatment for advanced disease, despite a response rate of only 20%. Herein, we show that the antioxidants pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and vitamin E induce apoptosis in CRC cells. This effect is mediated by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1, a powerful inhibitor of the cell cycle, through a mechanism involving C/EBPbeta (a member of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein family of transcription factors), independent of p53. Antioxidants significantly enhance CRC tumor growth inhibition by cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro (5FU and doxorubicin) and in vivo (5FU).

Distinct patterns of angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression allowed us to distinguish between benign and malignant cells. Functional inactivation of VEGF-R2 by a blocking antibody disrupted ongoing angiogenesis and prevented invasion of malignant cells, without reducing tumor cell proliferation.

9334729,1997,Nature medicine,Tumor-selective transgene expression in vivo mediated by an E2F-responsive adenoviral vector.,"Recent data suggest that many tumors, such as malignant gliomas, have disrupted pRB function, either because of RB-1 gene mutations or as a result of mutations affecting upstream regulators of pRB such as cyclin D1 or p16/INK4a/MTS1 (ref. 1-5). Tumor suppression by pRB has been linked to its ability to repress E2F-responsive promoters such as the E2F-1 promoter. Thus, a prediction, which has not yet been demonstrated experimentally in vivo, is that E2F-responsive promoters should be more active in tumor cells relative to normal cells because of an excess of ""free"" E2F and loss of pRB/E2F repressor complexes. We demonstrate that adenoviral vectors that contain transgenes driven by the E2F-1 promoter can mediate tumor-selective gene expression in vivo, allowing for eradication of established gliomas with significantly less normal tissue toxicity than seen with standard adenoviral vectors. Our data indicate that de-repression of the E2F-1 promoter occurs in cancer cells in vivo, a finding that can be exploited to design viral vectors that mediate tumor-selective gene expression.","Parr, M J;Manome, Y;Tanaka, T;Wen, P;Kufe, D W;Kaelin, W G;Fine, H A"
9334731,1997,Nature medicine,Biallelic mutations in the ATM gene in T-prolymphocytic leukemia.,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune deficiency, genome instability and predisposition to malignancies, particularly T-cell neoplasms. The responsible gene, designated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), was recently identified by positional cloning in the chromosomal region 11q22.3-23.1 (ref. 4, 5) ATM is 150 kb in length, consists of 66 exons and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein of approximately 350 kDa (ref. 4-9). Although ATM is considered to be a tumorigenic factor in several human cancers, it has not yet been found mutated in tumors of non-AT patients. Given the marked predisposition of AT patients to develop neoplasms of the T-cell lineage, we analyzed a series of T-cell leukemias (T-prolymphocytic leukemia, or T-PLL) in non-AT patients in search of genomic changes associated with the development of this disease. Among the recurrent aberrations identified, deletion of the chromosome arm 11q was very frequent. Subsequent molecular cytogenetic analyses allowed us to define a small commonly deleted segment at 11q22.3-23.1 in 15 of 24 T-PLLs studied. Since this critical region contained ATM, we further analyzed the remaining copy of the gene in six cases showing deletions affecting one ATM allele. In all six cases, mutations of the second ATM allele were identified, leading to the absence, premature truncation or alteration of the ATM gene product. Thus, our study demonstrates disruption of both ATM alleles by deletion or point mutation in T-PLL, suggesting that ATM functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in tumors of non-AT individuals.","Stilgenbauer, S;Schaffner, C;Litterst, A;Liebisch, P;Gilad, S;Bar-Shira, A;James, M R;Lichter, P;Döhner, H"
9334727,1997,Nature medicine,A secreted FGF-binding protein can serve as the angiogenic switch in human cancer.,"The growth and metastatic spread of cancer is directly related to tumor angiogenesis, and the driving factors need to be understood to exploit this process therapeutically. However, tumor cells and their normal stroma express a multitude of candidate angiogenic factors, and very few specific inhibitors have been generated to assess which of these gene products are only innocent bystanders and which contribute significantly to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Here we investigated whether the expression in tumors of a secreted fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-binding protein (FGF-BP) that mobilizes and activates locally stored FGFs (ref. 11) can serve as an angiogenic switch molecule. Developmental expression of the retinoid-regulated FGF-BP gene is prominent in the skin and intestine during the perinatal phase and is down-modulated in the adult. The gene is, however, upregulated in carcinogen-induced skin tumors, in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in some colon cancer cell lines and tumor samples. To assess the significance of FGF-BP expression in tumors, we depleted human SCC (ME-180) and colon carcinoma (LS174T) cell lines of their endogenous FGF-BP by targeting with specific ribozymes. We found that the reduction of FGF-BP reduced the release of biologically active basic FGF (bFGF) from cells in culture. Furthermore, the growth and angiogenesis of xenograft tumors in mice was decreased in parallel with the reduction of FGF-BP. This suggests that human tumors can utilize FGF-BP as an angiogenic switch molecule.","Czubayko, F;Liaudet-Coopman, E D;Aigner, A;Tuveson, A T;Berchem, G J;Wellstein, A"
9288734,1997,Nature medicine,Cell-cycle arrest versus cell death in cancer therapy.,"In response to anticancer therapeutics, human colon cancer cells growing in vitro either enter into a stable arrest or die, depending on the integrity of their cell-cycle checkpoints. To test whether altered checkpoints can modulate sensitivity to treatment in vivo, xenografts were established from isogenic lines differing only in their p21 checkpoint status. Although all tumors with intact checkpoint function underwent regrowth after treatment with gamma-radiation, a significant fraction of checkpoint-deficient tumors were completely cured. This difference in sensitivity was not detected by the clonogenic survival assay, because both arrest and death preclude outgrowth of colonies. These results demonstrate that checkpoint status affects sensitivity to anticancer treatments in vivo, and these findings have important implications for identifying and testing new therapeutic compounds.","Waldman, T;Zhang, Y;Dillehay, L;Yu, J;Kinzler, K;Vogelstein, B;Williams, J"
9288724,1997,Nature medicine,Acquired CD40-ligand deficiency in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) acquire an immunodeficiency with many characteristics similar to those of persons with inherited defects in the gene encoding the CD40-ligand (CD154). We found that the blood and splenic CD4+ T cells of patients with CLL failed to express surface CD154 after CD3 ligation. However, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we noted that CD3 ligation could induce such T cells to express CD154 messenger RNA at levels similar to that of CD3-activated T cells from normal donors. Moreover, addition of increasing numbers of CLL B cells to activated normal donor T cells rapidly resulted in progressively greater down-modulation of CD154. Such down-modulation of CD154 could be blocked by addition of CD40 monoclonal antibody to cultures in vitro. We propose that leukemia cell-mediated down-modulation of CD154 on activated T cells accounts for some of the acquired immune defects of patients with CLL.","Cantwell, M;Hua, T;Pappas, J;Kipps, T J"
9256286,1997,Nature medicine,"A novel anti-apoptosis gene, survivin, expressed in cancer and lymphoma.","Inhibitors of programmed cell death (apoptosis) aberrantly prolonging cell viability may contribute to cancer by facilitating the insurgence of mutations and by promoting resistance to therapy. Despite the identification of several new apoptosis inhibitors related to bcl-2 or to the baculovirus IAP gene, it is not clear whether apoptosis inhibition plays a general role in neoplasia. Here, we describe a new human gene encoding a structurally unique IAP apoptosis inhibitor, designated survivin. Survivin contains a single baculovirus IAP repeat and lacks a carboxyl-terminal RING finger. Present during fetal development, survivin is undetectable in terminally differentiated adult tissues. However, survivin becomes prominently expressed in transformed cell lines and in all the most common human cancers of lung, colon, pancreas, prostate and breast, in vivo. Survivin is also found in approximately 50% of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (centroblastic, immunoblastic), but not in low-grade lymphomas (lymphocytic). Recombinant expression of survivin counteracts apoptosis of B lymphocyte precursors deprived of interleukin 3 (IL-3). These findings suggest that apoptosis inhibition may be a general feature of neoplasia and identify survivin as a potential new target for apoptosis-based therapy in cancer and lymphoma.","Ambrosini, G;Adida, C;Altieri, D C"

The retinoblastoma family contains three members, pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130 (ref. 9), that are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, have cell growth suppressive properties and bind to specific members of the E2F family and various cyclins. Even though mesotheliomas are among the most aggressive human cancers, alterations of important cell-cycle ""controllers,"" such as the Rb family genes, have never been reported in these tumors. We found the presence of SV40-like sequences in 86% of 35 archival specimens of mesothelioma. We also demonstrated that SV40 Tag, isolated from frozen biopsies of human mesothelioma, binds each of the retinoblastoma family proteins, pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130, in four of four specimens. We propose that the tumorigenic potential of SV40 Tag in some human mesotheliomas may arise from its ability to interact with and thereby inactivate several tumor and/or growth suppressive proteins.","De Luca, A;Baldi, A;Esposito, V;Howard, C M;Bagella, L;Rizzo, P;Caputi, M;Pass, H I;Giordano, G G;Baldi, F;Carbone, M;Giordano, A"
9256284,1997,Nature medicine,Simian virus-40 large-T antigen binds p53 in human mesotheliomas.,"We found that simian virus 40 (SV40) induces mesotheliomas in hamsters and that 60% of human mesotheliomas contain and express SV40 sequences, results now confirmed by others [ref. 3-5, and presentations by D. Griffiths & R. Weiss, F.

Mesothelioma, an aggressive malignancy resistant to therapy, originates from the serosal lining of the pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities. The incidence of mesothelioma continues to increase worldwide because of exposure to crocidolite asbestos. However, at least 20% of mesotheliomas in the United States are not associated with asbestos exposure, and only a minority of people exposed to high concentrations of asbestos develop mesothelioma. Thus, other carcinogens may induce mesothelioma in individuals not exposed to asbestos, and/or may render particular individuals more susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of asbestos. We investigated whether the expression of the SV40 large T-antigen (Tag) interferes with the normal expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in human mesotheliomas. We found that SV40 Tag retains its ability to bind and to inactivate p53, a cellular protein that when normally expressed plays an important role in suppressing tumor growth and in inducing sensitivity to therapy. Our findings do not establish a cause-and-effect relation, but indicate that the possibility that SV40 contributes to the development of human mesotheliomas should be carefully investigated.","Carbone, M;Rizzo, P;Grimley, P M;Procopio, A;Mew, D J;Shridhar, V;de Bartolomeis, A;Esposito, V;Giuliano, M T;Steinberg, S M;Levine, A S;Giordano, A;Pass, H I"
9256280,1997,Nature medicine,Antisense targeting of basic fibroblast growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in human melanomas blocks intratumoral angiogenesis and tumor growth.,"Unlike normal melanocytes, primary and metastatic human melanomas express high levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) messenger RNA, and expression of these genes is essential in sustaining the proliferation of malignant melanomas in vitro. To determine whether bFGF and FGFR-1 are also required for tumor formation in these cells, liposome-mediated gene transfer was used to deliver episomal vectors containing antisense-oriented bFGF or FGFR-1 cDNAs into human melanomas, grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. The growth of tumors injected with these constructs was completely arrested or the tumors regressed as a result of blocked intratumoral angiogenesis and subsequent necrosis. Thus, inhibition of bFGF/FGFR-1-mediated signaling may open a new avenue for the treatment of advanced-stage melanomas.","Wang, Y;Becker, D"
9212109,1997,Nature medicine,Induction of basal cell carcinoma features in transgenic human skin expressing Sonic Hedgehog.,"Hedgehog (HH) signaling proteins mediate inductive events during animal development. Mutation of the only known HH receptor gene, Patched (PTC), has recently been implicated in inherited and sporadic forms of the most common human cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In Drosophila, HH acts by inactivating PTC function, raising the possibility that overexpression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in human epidermis might have a tumorigenic effect equivalent to loss of PTC function. We used retroviral transduction of normal human keratinocytes to constitutively express SHH. SHH-expressing cells demonstrated increased expression of both the known HH target, BMP-2B, as well as bcl-2, a protein prominently expressed by keratinocytes in BCCs. These keratinocytes were then used to regenerate human skin transgenic for long terminal repeat-driven SHH (LTR-SHH) on immune-deficient mice. LTR-SHH human skin consistently displays the abnormal specific histologic features seen in BCCs, including downgrowth of epithelial buds into the dermis, basal cell palisading and separation of epidermis from the underlying dermis. In addition, LTR-SHH skin displays the gene expression abnormalities previously described for human BCCs, including decreased BP180/BPAG2 and laminin 5 adhesion proteins and expression of basal epidermal keratins. These data indicate that expression of SHH in human skin recapitulates features of human BCC in vivo, suggest that activation of this conserved signaling pathway contributes to the development of epithelial neoplasia and describe a new transgenic human tissue model of neoplasia.","Fan, H;Oro, A E;Scott, M P;Khavari, P A"
9212107,1997,Nature medicine,Mapping pathophysiological features of breast tumors by MRI at high spatial resolution.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive method that reveals anatomical details in vivo and detects lesions for diagnosis. Although standard breast MRI cannot clearly delineate breast cancer, contrast-enhanced MRI enables the detection of breast masses with high sensitivity. Dynamic studies demonstrated that malignant lesions were characterized by a faster signal enhancement rate than benign ones. Dynamic MRI of human breast cancer in mice revealed high heterogeneity in the distribution of contrast-enhanced curves and derived pathophysiological features, indicating the importance of high spatial resolution. With clinical MRI, it is difficult to achieve simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution. In previous dynamic studies, the emphasis was on high temporal resolution and mainly empiric analyses. We describe here a new model-based method that optimizes spatial resolution by using only three time points, and yet characterizes tumor heterogeneity in terms of microvascular permeability and extracellular fraction. Mapping these pathophysiological features may aid diagnosis and prognosis assessment, while the high spatial resolution may improve the capacity to detect smaller lesions. The method was tested in human breast tumors implanted in mice and in a limited number of benign and malignant breast lesions of patients.","Degani, H;Gusis, V;Weinstein, D;Fields, S;Strano, S"
9212098,1997,Nature medicine,Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.,"On the subject of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), there is little consensus about the target cell within the hematopoietic stem cell hierarchy that is susceptible to leukemic transformation, or about the mechanism that underlies the phenotypic, genotypic and clinical heterogeneity. Here we demonstrate that the cell capable of initiating human AML in non-obese diabetic mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (NOD/SCID mice) - termed the SCID leukemia-initiating cell, or SL-IC - possesses the differentiative and proliferative capacities and the potential for self-renewal expected of a leukemic stem cell. The SL-ICs from all subtypes of AML analyzed, regardless of the heterogeneity in maturation characteristics of the leukemic blasts, were exclusively CD34++ CD38-, similar to the cell-surface phenotype of normal SCID-repopulating cells, suggesting that normal primitive cells, rather than committed progenitor cells, are the target for leukemic transformation. The SL-ICs were able to differentiate in vivo into leukemic blasts, indicating that the leukemic clone is organized as a hierarchy.","Bonnet, D;Dick, J E"
9176499,1997,Nature medicine,Novel retinoid-related molecules as apoptosis inducers and effective inhibitors of human lung cancer cells in vivo.,"Lung cancer causes more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States alone, and the prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is particularly poor. Therapies using small molecules that preferentially kill lung tumor cells by inducing cellular suicide (apoptosis) would therefore be highly desirable. Retinoids have shown promise as cancer preventive and cancer therapeutic agents. Retinoid signals are mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors: the retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha, beta, and gamma) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha, beta and gamma). These receptors usually bind as heterodimers to specific DNA sequences and/or interact with other transcriptional regulators, such as AP-1 (ref. 10) to regulate gene transcription. Synthetic retinoids can be made that activate only specific portions of the complex retinoid response network and activate selective biological programs. To identify retinoids with novel biological activities, we used a high-throughput ""biological activity fingerprint"" screen on a large library of retinoids and retinoid-related molecules (RRMs). We identified new structures that are highly effective against lung cancer cells in vitro, inducing apoptosis. We show here for one of these compounds that it is very effective against a human NSCLC in vivo in an animal model. These new molecules show a distinct pattern of receptor signaling.","Lu, X P;Fanjul, A;Picard, N;Pfahl, M;Rungta, D;Nared-Hood, K;Carter, B;Piedrafita, J;Tang, S;Fabbrizio, E;Pfahl, M"
9176498,1997,Nature medicine,Monoclonal antibodies against the 4-1BB T-cell activation molecule eradicate established tumors.,"The 4-1BB glycoprotein is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and binds to a high-affinity ligand (4-1BBL) expressed on several antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and activated B cells. Expression of 4-1BB is restricted to primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and 4-1BB signaling either by binding to 4-1BBL or by antibody ligation delivers a dual mitogenic signal for T-cell activation and growth. These observations suggest an important role for 4-1BB in the amplification of T cell-mediated immune responses. We now show that administration of anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibodies can eradicate established large tumors in mice, including the poorly immunogenic Ag104A sarcoma and the highly tumorigenic P815 masto cytoma. The immune response induced by anti-4- 1BB monoclonal antibodies is mediated by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and is accompanied by a marked augmentation of tumor-selective cytolytic T-cell activity. Our data suggest that a similar approach may be efficacious for immunotherapy of human cancer.","Melero, I;Shuford, W W;Newby, S A;Aruffo, A;Ledbetter, J A;Hellström, K E;Mittler, R S;Chen, L"

We now report that normal human cells were highly resistant to ONYX-015-mediated, replication-dependent cytolysis. In contrast, a wide range of human tumor cells, including numerous carcinoma lines with either mutant or normal p53 gene sequences (exons 5-9), were efficiently destroyed. Antitumoral efficacy was documented following intratumoral or intravenous administration of ONYX-015 to nude mouse-human tumor xenografts; efficacy with ONYX-015 plus chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) was significantly greater than with either agent alone.","Heise, C;Sampson-Johannes, A;Williams, A;McCormick, F;Von Hoff, D D;Kirn, D H"

Since DCs are pivotal in the induction of immune responses, we tested whether Flt3L treatment of mice challenged with a syngeneic methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarcoma would augment the generation of effective antitumor immune responses in vivo. Flt3L treatment not only induced complete tumor regression in a significant proportion of mice, but also decreased tumor growth rate in the remaining mice. A preliminary characterization of the cellular mechanisms involved suggests that Flt3L may be important in the treatment of cancer in situ through the generation of specific antitumor immune responses.","Lynch, D H;Andreasen, A;Maraskovsky, E;Whitmore, J;Miller, R E;Schuh, J C"

Cystoscopy is currently the ""gold standard,"" but it is invasive, expensive and uncomfortable for the patient. Recently, we demonstrated a novel approach for the detection of primary bladder cancer based on microsatellite analysis of urine DNA. To determine the feasibility of this technique for following-up patients with TCC, we tested serial urine samples from 21 patients who had been treated for bladder cancer with 20 polymorphic microsatellite markers in a blinded fashion. We detected recurrent lesions in 10 out of 11 patients and correctly predicted the existence of a neoplastic cell population in the urine of two patients, 4 and 6 months before cystoscopic evidence of the tumor. The assay was negative in 10 of 10 patients who had no evident cancer. Microsatellite analysis of urine sediment represents a novel and potentially powerful clinical tool for the detection of recurrent bladder cancer.","Steiner, G;Schoenberg, M P;Linn, J F;Mao, L;Sidransky, D"
9142127,1997,Nature medicine,Induction of antitumor activity by immunization with fusions of dendritic and carcinoma cells.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells that prime naive cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs).

The fusion cells were positive for major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and II, costimulating molecules and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The results show that the fusion cells stimulate naive T cells in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and induce MC38 tumor-specific CTLs in vivo. Antibody-mediated depletion experiments demonstrate that induction of CD4+ and CD8+ CTLs protects against challenge with tumor cells. We also show that immunization with the fusion cells induces rejection of established metastases. These findings represent the first demonstration that fusions of DCs and tumor cells can be used in the treatment of cancer.","Gong, J;Chen, D;Kashiwaba, M;Kufe, D"

Application of SPF-15 sunscreens to mouse skin before each UV irradiation nearly abolished the frequency of p53 mutations.

9095181,1997,Nature medicine,Effective tumor vaccines generated by in vitro modification of tumor cells with cytokines and bispecific monoclonal antibodies.,"Antitumor immune responses are mediated primarily by T cells. Downregulation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the molecules that costimulate the immune response is associated with defective signaling by tumor cells for T-cell activation. In vitro treatment with a combination of cytokines significantly increased the expression of MHC class I and adhesion molecules on tumor cell surfaces. When tumor cells were first incubated with a bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds antigen on tumor cells to CD28 on T cells, the modified tumor cells become immunogenic and are able to stimulate naive T cells, generating tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Immunization with the modified tumor cells elicits an immune response mediated by CD8+ T cells. This response protected against a challenge with parental tumor cells and cured established tumors. The approach was effective in both low immunogenic and nonimmunogenic tumor model systems. Modification of tumor cells with this two-step procedure may provide a strategy for development of tumor vaccines that is effective for cancer immunotherapy.","Guo, Y J;Che, X Y;Shen, F;Xie, T P;Ma, J;Wang, X N;Wu, S G;Anthony, D D;Wu, M C"
9095180,1997,Nature medicine,Nuclear localization and increased levels of transcription factor YB-1 in primary human breast cancers are associated with intrinsic MDR1 gene expression.,"Breast cancers are either primarily resistant to chemotherapy (intrinsic resistance), or respond to chemotherapy but later recur with a multidrug-resistant phenotype because of overexpression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein. The MDR1 gene encoding P-glycoprotein may be transcriptionally regulated by a Y-box transcription factor. We now report that, in multidrug-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells, nuclear localization of YB-1 is associated with MDR-1 gene expression. In drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells, however, YB-1 was localized to the cytoplasm. Regulated overexpression of YB-1 in drug-sensitive diploid breast epithelial cells induced MDR-1 gene expression and multidrug resistance. In 27 out of 27 untreated primary breast cancers, YB-1 protein was expressed in the cytoplasm although it was undetectable in normal breast tissue of these patients. In a subgroup of tumors (9/27), however, YB-1 was also localized to the nucleus and, in these cases, high levels of P-glycoprotein were present. These results show that in a subset of untreated primary breast cancers, nuclear localization of YB-1 protein is associated with intrinsic multidrug resistance. Our data show that YB-1 has an important role in controlling MDR1 gene transcription and this finding provides a basis for the analysis of molecular mechanisms responsible for intrinsic multidrug resistance in human breast cancer.","Bargou, R C;Jürchott, K;Wagener, C;Bergmann, S;Metzner, S;Bommert, K;Mapara, M Y;Winzer, K J;Dietel, M;Dörken, B;Royer, H D"
9095178,1997,Nature medicine,Viral vector-mediated transduction of a modified platelet factor 4 cDNA inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth.,"Chronic systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins, such as inhibitors of angiogenesis, present a number of difficult pharmacological challenges. To overcome these problems for one such protein, we constructed retroviral and adenoviral vectors that express a novel, secretable form of the antiangiogenic protein, platelet factor 4 (sPF4). Vector-mediated sPF4 transduction selectively inhibits endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, and results in hypovascular tumors that grow slowly in vivo. Additionally, tumor-associated angiogenesis is inhibited and animal survival is prolonged, following transduction of established intracerebral gliomas by an sPF4-expressing adenoviral vector. These data support the concept that targeted antiangiogenesis, using virally mediated gene transfer, represents a promising strategy for delivering antiangiogenic therapy.","Tanaka, T;Manome, Y;Wen, P;Kufe, D W;Fine, H A"

Explants from six of eight patients formed prostate tumors and two showed unique cytogenetic, biologic and molecular features that were retained through six or more passages. One grew in an androgen-independent fashion, whereas the second formed tumors that regressed following castration then regrew.

9018245,1997,Nature medicine,Increased proteasome-dependent degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 in aggressive colorectal carcinomas.,"The cell-cycle inhibitor p27 is a potential tumor suppressor, but its gene has never been found inactivated in human tumors. Because cell-cycle regulation of p27 cellular abundance occurs at the post-transcriptional level, we analyzed p27 protein expression and degradation in human colorectal carcinomas. Proteasome-mediated degradation activity of p27 was compared with its protein levels in a subset of tumor samples. We found that carcinomas with low or absent p27 protein displayed enhanced proteolytic activity specific for p27, suggesting that low p27 expression can result from increased proteasome-mediated degradation rather than altered gene expression. Patients whose tumors expressed p27 had a median survival of 151 months, whereas patients who lacked p27 (10%) had a median survival of 69 months. By multivariate analysis, p27 was found to be an independent prognostic marker. Lack of p27 was associated with poor prognosis (2.9 risk ratio for death; P = 0.003). The absence of p27 protein expression is thus a powerful negative prognostic marker in colorectal carcinomas, particularly in stage II tumors, and thereby may help in the selection of patients who will benefit from adjuvant therapy. These data suggest that aggressive tumors may result from the selection of a clone or clones that lack p27 due to increased proteasome-mediated degradation.","Loda, M;Cukor, B;Tam, S W;Lavin, P;Fiorentino, M;Draetta, G F;Jessup, J M;Pagano, M"
9018244,1997,Nature medicine,Decreased levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 protein: prognostic implications in primary breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North American women. There is considerable need for reliable prognostic markers to assist clinicians in making management decisions. Although a variety of factors have been tested, only tumor stage, grade, size, hormone receptor status, and S-phase fraction are used on a routine basis. The cell cycle is governed by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), which are regulated by associated cyclins and by phosphorylation. p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, regulates progression from G1 into S phase by binding and inhibiting cyclin/cdks. p27Kip1 protein levels and/or activity are upregulated by growth inhibitory cytokines including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and, thus, provide an important link between extracellular regulators and the cell cycle. Loss of p27Kip1, a negative cell-cycle regulator, may contribute to oncogenesis and tumor progression. However, p27Kip1 mutations in human tumors are extremely rare. We have demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that p27Kip1 protein levels are reduced in primary breast cancers and that this is associated with tumor progression in both in situ and invasive lesions. This was confirmed by western analysis, reflected in increased G1/S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase activities and shown to be regulated posttranscriptionally by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, on multivariate analysis, low p27Kip1 is a predictor of reduced disease-free survival. This simple and reliable immunohistochemical assay may become a routine part of breast cancer evaluation and may influence patient management.","Catzavelos, C;Bhattacharya, N;Ung, Y C;Wilson, J A;Roncari, L;Sandhu, C;Shaw, P;Yeger, H;Morava-Protzner, I;Kapusta, L;Franssen, E;Pritchard, K I;Slingerland, J M"

It is now known that levels of both cyclin E and p27 can be controlled by posttranscriptional mechanisms, indicating that expression of these proteins can be altered by means other than simply mutation of their respective genes. Thus, changes in p27 and cyclin E protein levels in tumors might be more common than previously anticipated and may be indicators of tumor behavior.","Porter, P L;Malone, K E;Heagerty, P J;Alexander, G M;Gatti, L A;Firpo, E J;Daling, J R;Roberts, J M"

We report here the first combined, high-resolution (< or = 10 microns) measurements of interstitial pH and pO2 profiles between adjacent vessels in a human tumor xenograft, using fluorescence ratio imaging and phosphorescence quenching microscopy. We found (1) heterogeneity in shapes of pH and pO2 profiles; (2) a discordant relation between local pH profiles and corresponding pO2 profiles, yet a strong correlation between mean pH and pO2 profiles; (3) no correlation between perivascular pH/pO2 and nearest vessel blood flow; and (4) well-perfused tumor vessels that were hypoxic and, consequently, large hypoxic areas in the surrounding interstitium. Such multiparameter measurements of the in vivo microenvironment provide unique insights into biological processes in tumors and their response to treatment.","Helmlinger, G;Yuan, F;Dellian, M;Jain, R K"
9018235,1997,Nature medicine,Suppression of SPARC expression by antisense RNA abrogates the tumorigenicity of human melanoma cells.,"Acquisition of invasive/metastatic potential is a key event in tumor progression. Cell surface glycoproteins and their respective matrix ligands have been implicated in this process. Recent evidence reveals that the secreted glycoprotein SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) is highly expressed in different malignant tissues. The present study reports that the suppression of SPARC expression by human melanoma cells using a SPARC antisense expression vector results in a significant decrease in the in vitro adhesive and invasive capacities of tumor cells, completely abolishing their in vivo tumorigenicity. This is the first evidence that SPARC plays a key role in human melanoma invasive-metastatic phenotype development.","Ledda, M F;Adris, S;Bravo, A I;Kairiyama, C;Bover, L;Chernajovsky, Y;Mordoh, J;Podhajcer, O L"
9018234,1997,Nature medicine,Antitumor effect of locally produced CD95 ligand.,"Activation of the cell-surface antigen CD95 induces apoptosis of CD95-bearing tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of locally produced CD95 ligand (CD95L) on CD95-negative tumor cells in vivo. Introduction of CD95L cDNA into murine tumor cells did not affect growth in vitro but caused rejection in vivo. Neutrophils were primarily responsible for this rejection. A CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity against subsequent challenge with parental tumor cells was also elicited. These results provide evidence for the potential utility of CD95L in tumor eradication and also reveal a proinflammatory function of CD95L.","Seino, K;Kayagaki, N;Okumura, K;Yagita, H"
8986738,1997,Nature medicine,A new transmissible AIDS-like disease in mice induced by alloimmune stimuli.,"The search for a suitable and reliable animal model for human AIDS that is easy to use on a large scale continues. Here we describe a new condition in mice that closely resembles human AIDS, namely, chronic lymphoproliferation with dramatic depletion of CD4-positive cells, progressive impairment of the immune responses, and Kaposi's sarcoma-like tumors or terminal B-lymphomas. The AIDS-like disease was primarily induced by mating BALB/c female mice to C57BL/6 males during a 1-year period (7-10 allogeneic pregnancies) followed by immunization with paternal lymphocytes. The disease is sexually and vertically transmissible, transferrable by cell-free plasma and is associated with autoimmune reactions to major histocompatibility complex antigens and CD4 cells. We hope that this becomes a model for studying the mechanisms of AIDS immunopathogenesis and immune-based treatment approaches.","Ter-Grigorov, V S;Krifuks, O;Liubashevsky, E;Nyska, A;Trainin, Z;Toder, V"
8946840,1996,Nature medicine,Epstein-Barr virus-driven gene therapy for EBV-related lymphomas.,"Genetic alterations in malignant tissues are potential targets for gene-based cancer therapies. Alternatively, aberrant expression of certain specific genes associated with malignant transformation may be envisioned to enhance the expression of chemosensitizing drugs. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related B-cell lymphomas are fatal complications of immunosuppression due to AIDS, organ transplantation or congenital immune abnormalities. The malignant cells latently infected with EBV typically express the transcription factor EBNA2 as one of nine latent viral genes. We tested whether an EBNA2-responsive EBV promoter may selectively target EBV-related lymphoma cells by virus-regulated expression of a suicide gene. Using the BamC promoter driving a hygromycin-thymidine kinase fusion gene or controls, we demonstrated that sensitivity to ganciclovir was selectively enhanced in cells expressing EBNA2. Further, there was complete macroscopic regression of established B-cell lymphomas in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID mice) treated with a single course of ganciclovir. These data provide in vitro and in vivo support for a model of exploiting the molecular basis of tumor development to enhance the specificity of gene therapy.","Franken, M;Estabrooks, A;Cavacini, L;Sherburne, B;Wang, F;Scadden, D T"
8946837,1996,Nature medicine,"Breast cancer-associated antigen, DF3/MUC1, induces apoptosis of activated human T cells.","Given the plethora of well-documented breast carcinoma-associated antigens in humans including MAGE-1, -2 and -3, mutated p53, p21ras, HER-2/neu and DF3/MUC-1, coupled with evidence that humoral and cytotoxic T-cell responses against these antigens exist, the central dilemma facing tumor immunologists is why the host immune response is so inefficient. One possibility is that tumor cells themselves are either inefficient or ineffective antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The failure of tumor cells to function as APCs may be due to their inability to process and present the antigen, the absence or insufficient numbers of adhesion and costimulatory molecules or, potentially, the secretion of inhibitory cytokines. Therefore, we sought to determine whether human breast cancer cell lines could function as APCs and, if not, to identify mechanism(s) responsible for this defect. Here, we show that human breast cancer cell lines fail to present alloantigen. This defect does not reside in their inherent capacity to present antigen but rather is due to apoptosis of activated T cells induced by exposure to the breast carcinoma-associated mucin antigen, DF3/MUC1. These results support the hypothesis that DF3/MUC1 may contribute to the paucity of clinically significant anticarcinoma-specific immune responses.","Gimmi, C D;Morrison, B W;Mainprice, B A;Gribben, J G;Boussiotis, V A;Freeman, G J;Park, S Y;Watanabe, M;Gong, J;Hayes, D F;Kufe, D W;Nadler, L M"
8946836,1996,Nature medicine,Lymphocyte apoptosis induced by CD95 (APO-1/Fas) ligand-expressing tumor cells--a mechanism of immune evasion?,"The CD95 (APO-1/Fas) system is an important mediator of T-cell cytotoxicity. We investigated this system in 22 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from patients. All HCCs had partially or completely lost the expression of the CD95 receptor constitutively expressed by normal liver cells and might thus evade CD95-mediated killing. We also considered a new mechanism of immune evasion, namely, the active destruction of T-lymphocytes by tumor cells expressing CD95 ligand (CD95L). CD95L messenger RNA and protein could be detected in the HCCs. In coculture experiments, HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells, expressing CD95L mRNA after treatment with cytostatic drugs, killed CD95+ Jurkat lymphocytes. Our data suggest that tumor cells can evade immune attack by down-regulation of the CD95 receptor and killing of lymphocytes through expression of CD95L.","Strand, S;Hofmann, W J;Hug, H;Müller, M;Otto, G;Strand, D;Mariani, S M;Stremmel, W;Krammer, P H;Galle, P R"
8946830,1996,Nature medicine,Thymosin beta 15: a novel regulator of tumor cell motility upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer.,"The Dunning rat prostatic carcinoma is a model system where cell motility closely correlates with the metastatic phenotype. We have identified a novel gene, upregulated in the highly motile and metastatic Dunning cancer cell lines, that represents a new member of the thymosin-beta family, thymosin beta 15. Transfection of antisense thymosin beta 15 constructs into rat prostatic carcinoma cells demonstrates that this molecule positively regulates cell motility, a critical component of the metastatic pathway. Thymosin beta 15 levels are elevated in human prostate cancer and correlate positively with the Gleason tumor grade. Thymosin beta 15 may represent a potential new biochemical marker for human prostate cancer progression.","Bao, L;Loda, M;Janmey, P A;Stewart, R;Anand-Apte, B;Zetter, B R"

Studies to date have demonstrated cancer suppression with tumor cells reconstituted with RB ex vivo and implanted into immunodeficient mice, as well as with germline transmission of a human RB transgene into tumor-prone Rb +/- mice. To mimic the therapy of cancer more closely, spontaneous pituitary melanotroph tumors arising in immunocompetent Rb +/- mice were treated with a recombinant adenovirus carrying RB cDNA. Intratumoral RB gene transfer decreased tumor cell proliferation, reestablished innervation by growth-regulatory dopaminergic neurons, inhibited the growth of tumors, and prolonged the life spans of treated animals.","Riley, D J;Nikitin, A Y;Lee, W H"

Tumor cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix through integrins is thought to be a critical step in metastasis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. We show here that treatment of human osteosarcoma, melanoma and carcinoma cells with a polymeric form of fibronectin (sFN), before inoculation into nude mice, prevented tumor formation. Intraperitoneally administered sFN significantly reduced lung colonization from intravenously injected tumor cells (experimental metastasis) and from subcutaneous tumors in nude mice (spontaneous metastasis). Treatment with sFN blocked cell spreading and migration in vitro suggesting a possible mechanism for the antimetastatic effect.","Pasqualini, R;Bourdoulous, S;Koivunen, E;Woods, V L;Ruoslahti, E"
8837611,1996,Nature medicine,DNA-based immunization by in vivo transfection of dendritic cells.,"Delivery of antigen in a manner that induces effective, antigen-specific immunity is a critical challenge in vaccine design. Optimal antigen presentation is mediated by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) capable of taking up, processing and presenting antigen to T cells in the context of costimulatory signals required for T-cell activation. Developing immunization strategies to optimize antigen presentation by dendritic cells, the most potent APCs, is a rational approach to vaccine design. Here we show that cutaneous genetic immunization with naked DNA results in potent, antigen-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated protective tumor immunity. This method of immunization results in the transfection of skin-derived dendritic cells, which localize in the draining lymph nodes. These observations provide a basis for further development of DNA-based vaccines and demonstrate the feasibility of genetically engineering dendritic cells in vivo.","Condon, C;Watkins, S C;Celluzzi, C M;Thompson, K;Falo, L D"

Here, we show that human cancer cell lines release a soluble factor or factors that dramatically affect DC maturation from precursors without affecting the function of relatively mature DCs. One factor responsible for these effects was identified as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, VEGF may play a broader role in the pathogenesis of cancer than was previously thought, and therapeutic blockade of VEGF action may improve prospects for immunotherapy as well as inhibit tumor neovasculature.","Gabrilovich, D I;Chen, H L;Girgis, K R;Cunningham, H T;Meny, G M;Nadaf, S;Kavanaugh, D;Carbone, D P"
8837606,1996,Nature medicine,Combined chemokine and cytokine gene transfer enhances antitumor immunity.,"The probability of producing a specific antitumor response should be increased by multiplying the number of T lymphocytes that encounter the malignant cells. We tested this prediction in a murine model, using a recently discovered T-cell chemokine, lymphotactin (Lptn). This chemokine increased tumor cell infiltration with CD4+ lymphocytes but generated little antitumor activity. Coexpression of the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2, however, greatly expanded the T lymphocytes attracted by Lptn, affording protection from the growth of established tumor in a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Lesser synergy was seen with GM-CSF. Hence coexpression of a T-cell chemokine and T-cell growth factor potentiates antitumor responses in vivo, suggesting a general strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy.","Dilloo, D;Bacon, K;Holden, W;Zhong, W;Burdach, S;Zlotnik, A;Brenner, M"
8782465,1996,Nature medicine,DNA immunization induces protective immunity against B-cell lymphoma.,"Idiotypic determinants of the immunoglobulin expressed on the surface of B-cell lymphomas are tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), which can be targeted by immunotherapy. Immunization with DNA constructs encoding the idiotype (ld) of a murine B-cell lymphoma induced specific anti-ld antibody responses and protected mice against tumor challenge. Use of DNA encoding an ld/GM-CSF (idiotype/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) fusion protein improved vaccine efficacy, and xenogeneic immunoglobulin constant region determinants were required for immunogenicity. These results indicate that DNA may be a simple and efficacious means of inducing immune responses against a weak, otherwise unrecognized tumor antigen, provided that additional stimuli are included with the DNA.","Syrengelas, A D;Chen, T T;Levy, R"
8782464,1996,Nature medicine,Microsatellite alterations in serum DNA of head and neck cancer patients.,"Microsatellite DNA alterations are an integral part of neoplastic progression and are valuable as clonal markers for the detection of human cancers. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that senescent tumor cells may release DNA into the circulation, which is subsequently carried by and therefore enriched in the serum and plasma. We tested 21 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite analysis of DNA from lymphocytes and paired serum samples. Patients were scored for alterations as defined by the presence of new alleles (shifts) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in serum at each of 12 markers and then compared with primary tumor DNA. Six out of 21 patients (29%) were found to have one or more microsatellite alterations in serum precisely matching those in the primary tumors. All six patients had advanced disease (stage III or IV); five of these patients had nodal metastases, three later developed distant metastases, and four died of disease. Microsatellite analysis of serum represents a novel method for the detection of circulating tumor cell DNA. If these results are confirmed in larger studies, microsatellite markers may be useful in assessing tumor burden in cancer patients.","Nawroz, H;Koch, W;Anker, P;Stroun, M;Sidransky, D"
8782463,1996,Nature medicine,Microsatellite alterations in plasma DNA of small cell lung cancer patients.,"Microsatellite instability is an important characteristic of many tumor types especially those associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) syndrome.

Because neoplastic characteristics such as decreased strand stability9 and ras mutations have been found in the plasma DNA of cancer patients, we looked for microsatellite alterations in the plasma of SCLC patients. A microsatellite alteration was present in 16 out of 21 (76%) SCLC tumors and in 15 out of 21 (71%) plasma samples. In one case, the alteration was present only in the plasma DNA. If confirmed in larger studies, microsatellite analysis of plasma DNA might constitute a new tool for tumor staging, management and, possibly, detection.","Chen, X Q;Stroun, M;Magnenat, J L;Nicod, L P;Kurt, A M;Lyautey, J;Lederrey, C;Anker, P"

In vitro and in vivo studies of A-NK cell adhesion to endothelial cells showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes adhesion, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) inhibits adhesion through the regulation of these molecules on tumor vasculature. Thus, some angiogenic factors may facilitate lymphocyte recognition of angiogenic vessels, whereas others may provide such vessels with a mechanism that protects them from cytotoxic lymphocytes.","Melder, R J;Koenig, G C;Witwer, B P;Safabakhsh, N;Munn, L L;Jain, R K"

Combinatorial libraries of scFv genes contain great diversity, and scFv antibodies with characteristics optimized for a particular task can be selected from them using filamentous bacteriophage. We illustrate the benefits of this system by imaging patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-producing cancers using an iodine-123 labeled scFv anti-CEA selected for high affinity.

ScFvs are produced in a cloned form and can be readily engineered to have localizing and therapeutic functions that will be applicable in cancer and other diseases.","Begent, R H;Verhaar, M J;Chester, K A;Casey, J L;Green, A J;Napier, M P;Hope-Stone, L D;Cushen, N;Keep, P A;Johnson, C J;Hawkins, R E;Hilson, A J;Robson, L"
8705864,1996,Nature medicine,"KSHV antibodies among Americans, Italians and Ugandans with and without Kaposi's sarcoma.","A major controversy regarding Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8) is whether or not it is a ubiquitous infection of humans. Immunoassays based on KSHV- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-coinfected cell lines show that most US AIDS-KS patients have specific antibodies to KSHV-related antigens. We have developed a sensitive indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) based on an EBV-negative, KSHV-infected cell line, BCP-1. When we used this IFA assay, KSHV-related antibodies were found in 71-88% of serum samples from US, Italian and Ugandan AIDS-KS patients, as well as all serum samples examined from HIV-seronegative KS patients. Although none of the US blood donors examined were KSHV seropositive by IFA, intermediate and high seroprevalence rates were found in Italian and Ugandan control populations. Antibody kinetics showed that more than half of the AIDS-KS patients who were examined IgG-seroconverted before KS development, and antibody levels did not decline after seroconversion. For these patients, seropositivity rates increased linearly with time, suggesting that the rate of infection was constant and that the risk of developing KS once infected with KSHV is not highly dependent on the duration of infection. These data strongly suggest that KSHV is not ubiquitous in most populations and that the virus may be under strict immunologic control in healthy KSHV-infected persons.","Gao, S J;Kingsley, L;Li, M;Zheng, W;Parravicini, C;Ziegler, J;Newton, R;Rinaldo, C R;Saah, A;Phair, J;Detels, R;Chang, Y;Moore, P S"

Using an immunofluorescence assay, we examined serum samples from 913 patients for the presence of antibody specific for infection by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), an agent whose genome is regularly found in KS tissue. The distribution of HHV8 seropositivity conforms to that expected for a sexually transmitted pathogen and tracks closely with the risk for KS development.

8673929,1996,Nature medicine,Specific P53 mutations are associated with de novo resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer patients.,"The mechanisms causing resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer patients are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that different forms of chemotherapy may exert their cytotoxic effects by inducing apoptosis. The tumor suppressor gene P53 has a pivotal role inducing apoptosis in response to cellular damage. In vitro investigations have shown intact p53 to play a critical role executing cell death in response to treatment with cytotoxic drugs like 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and doxorubicin. Recently, mutations in the P53 gene were found to confer resistance to anthracyclines in a mouse sarcoma tumor model, and overexpression of the p53 protein (which, in most cases, is due to a mutated gene) was found to be associated with lack of response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Previous studies have shown mutations in the P53 gene or overexpression of the p53 protein to predict a poor prognosis, but also a beneficial effect of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy in breast cancer. In this study we present data linking specific mutations in the P53 gene to primary resistance to doxorubicin therapy and early relapse in breast cancer patients.","Aas, T;Børresen, A L;Geisler, S;Smith-Sørensen, B;Johnsen, H;Varhaug, J E;Akslen, L A;Lønning, P E"

We have characterized two murine teratocarcinoma cell lines and find no evidence that endogenous p53-regulated genes are correspondingly upregulated. Differentiation of these teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid results in a marked decrease in p53 protein levels but is accompanied by a marked increase in p53-mediated transcriptional activity. Together these results support the hypothesis that the p53 protein in undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells is transcriptionally inactive and accounts for the lack of selection for p53 gene mutations in this tumor type. These teratocarcinoma cells undergo p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which may explain the routine cures of human testicular tumors with combination chemotherapy.","Lutzker, S G;Levine, A J"

H-cadherin encodes a protein related to the cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, and its expression is shown to be significantly reduced in human breast carcinoma cell lines and breast cancer specimens. H-cadherin was localized to chromosome 16q24 and is highly expressed in the heart. Introduction of H-cadherin cDNA markedly diminished tumor cell growth and resulted in a significant change from invasive morphology to a normal cell-like morphology in the Matrigel outgrowth assay.

8640562,1996,Nature medicine,Angiostatin induces and sustains dormancy of human primary tumors in mice.,"There is now considerable direct evidence that tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent. The most compelling evidence is based on the discovery of angiostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor that selectively instructs endothelium to become refractory to angiogenic stimuli. Angiostatin, which specifically inhibits endothelial proliferation, induced dormancy of metastases defined by a balance of apoptosis and proliferation. We now show that systemic administration of human angiostatin potently inhibits the growth of three human and three murine primary carcinomas in mice. An almost complete inhibition of tumor growth was observed without detectable toxicity or resistance. The human carcinomas regressed to microscopic dormant foci in which tumor cell proliferation was balanced by apoptosis in the presence of blocked angiogenesis. This regression of primary tumors without toxicity has not been previously described. This is also the first demonstration of dormancy therapy, a novel anticancer strategy in which malignant tumors are regressed by prolonged blockade of angiogenesis.","O'Reilly, M S;Holmgren, L;Chen, C;Folkman, J"
8640561,1996,Nature medicine,Growth arrest of solid human neuroblastoma xenografts in nude rats by natural IgM from healthy humans.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid neoplasm of infancy and is associated with very poor prognosis in patients with advanced disease. Current therapeutic regimens of advanced NB which combine surgical resection with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy brought some improvements, but in a significant number of patients, a cure remains elusive. Normal human serum of healthy adults contains natural IgM antibodies that are cytotoxic for human NB cells. In this study, we evaluated the anti-NB activity of these natural IgM antibodies in nude rats bearing solid human NB tumors. A single intravenous (i.v.) injection of purified cytotoxic IgM led to uptake of IgM into the tumors with massive perivascular complement activation and accumulation of neutrophil granulocytes after 24 hours. Five consecutive i.v. injections of purified cytotoxic IgM into NB-bearing animals resulted in complete growth arrest of even large and established solid tumors which lasted for several weeks after discontinuation of the injections, whereas tumors of control animals continued to grow exponentially during the observation period. These studies suggest that natural anti-NB IgM may have a potential as a novel therapeutic modality in the treatment of human NB.","David, K;Ollert, M W;Juhl, H;Vollmert, C;Erttmann, R;Vogel, C W;Bredehorst, R"
8640560,1996,Nature medicine,Frequent microsatellite alterations at chromosomes 9p21 and 3p14 in oral premalignant lesions and their value in cancer risk assessment.,"To better understand genetic alterations in oral premalignant lesions, we examined 84 oral leukoplakia samples from 37 patients who had been enrolled in a chemoprevention trial. The samples were analyzed for two microsatellite markers located at chromosomes 9p21 and 3p14. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at either or both loci was identified in 19 of the 37 (51%) patients. Of these 19 patients, seven (37%) have developed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) while only one of 18 (6%) of patients without LOH developed HNSCC. Our data suggest that clonal genetic alterations are common in oral premalignant lesions; that multiple genetic alterations have already occurred in oral premalignant lesions, allowing at least a focal clonal expansion; and that losses of the 9p21 and 3p14 regions may be related to early processes of tumorigenesis in HNSCC. These genetic alterations in premalignant tissues may serve as markers for cancer risk assessment.","Mao, L;Lee, J S;Fan, Y H;Ro, J Y;Batsakis, J G;Lippman, S;Hittelman, W;Hong, W K"
8640559,1996,Nature medicine,Somatic microsatellite mutations as molecular tumor clocks.,"Microsatellite (MS) mutations can potentially unravel the past of mutator phenotype tumors, with greater genetic diversity expected in older regions. Rapid clonal expansions of xenografts were characterized by relatively homogenous MS alleles, whereas greater diversity was observed in a colorectal cancer with the greatest variation in its adjacent adenoma. A subcutaneous lung cancer metastasis demonstrated diversity consistent with its one-month clinical duration and evidence of active mitosis during dormancy. The genetic legacy inherent to multistep tumorigenesis provides direct estimates of tumor ages, with up to thousands of cell divisions and high death rates necessary to yield the observed diversities. MS molecular tumor clocks have the unique potential to systematically reconstruct the early and occult evolution of individual human mutator phenotype tumors.","Shibata, D;Navidi, W;Salovaara, R;Li, Z H;Aaltonen, L A"
8616723,1996,Nature medicine,Cystic fibrosis hetero- and homozygosity is associated with inhibition of breast cancer growth.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal recessive genetic disease of the Caucasian population. Although reports of cancer frequency in CF have emphasized an elevated observed-to-expected ratio of 6.5 for digestive tract cancers, these studies also show a significantly decreased observed-to-expected ratio for other malignancies including breast cancer. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as an ATP channel. We found that heterozygous and homozygous CFTR knockout mice had elevated blood ATP concentrations. Elevated extracellular ATP is known to inhibit tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Using double mutant mice created by F2 generation crosses of CFTR knockout and nude mice, we observed reduced breast tumor implantability in CFTR homozygous nude animals. Decreased tumor growth rate was observed in both CFTR heterozygous and homozygous nude animals. Extracellular ATP reduced human breast tumor cell growth rate in vitro, and a breast tumor transfected with human CFTR that had high extracellular ATP concentrations in vitro correspondingly had a slower growth rate in vivo. The results suggest that both CFTR heterozygosity and homozygosity suppress breast cancer growth and that elevated extracellular ATP can account for this phenomenon.","Abraham, E H;Vos, P;Kahn, J;Grubman, S A;Jefferson, D M;Ding, I;Okunieff, P"
8616718,1996,Nature medicine,Involvement of the CD95 (APO-1/FAS) receptor/ligand system in drug-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.,"Cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy of leukemias and solid tumors cause apoptosis in target cells. In lymphoid cells the CD95 (APO-1/Fas)/CD95 ligand (CD95-L) system is a key regulator of apoptosis. Here we describe that doxorbicin induces apoptosis via the CD95/CD95-L system in human leukemia T-cell lines. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by inhibition of gene expression and protein synthesis. Also, doxorbicin strongly stimulates CD95-L messenger RNA expression in vitro at concentrations relevant for therapy in vivo. CEM and jurkat cells resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis were also resistant to doxorbicin-induced apoptosis . Furthermore, doxorbicin-induced apoptosis was inhibited by blocking F(ab')2 anti-APO-1 (anti-CD95) antibody fragments. Expression of CD95-L mRNA and protein in vitro was also stimulated by other cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate. The finding that apoptosis caused by anticancer drugs may be mediated via the CD95 system provides a new molecular insight into resistance and sensitivity toward chemotherapy in malignancies.","Friesen, C;Herr, I;Krammer, P H;Debatin, K M"
8616717,1996,Nature medicine,Viral vector transduction of the human deoxycytidine kinase cDNA sensitizes glioma cells to the cytotoxic effects of cytosine arabinoside in vitro and in vivo.,"Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is a cytidine analog that incorporates into replicating DNA and induces lethal DNA strand breaks. Although ara-C is a potent antitumor agent for hematologic malignancies, it has only minimal activity against most solid tumors. The rate-limiting step in intracellular ara-C activation is phosphorylation of the prodrug by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). The present results demonstrate that both retroviral and adenoviral vector-mediated transduction of the dCK cDNA results in marked sensitization of glioma cells lines to the cytotoxic effects of ara-C in vitro. We also demonstrate that ara-C treatment of established intradermal and intracerebral gliomas transduced with dCK results in significant antitumor effects in vivo. These data suggest that viral vector transduction of the dCK gene followed by treatment with ara-C represents a new chemosensitization strategy for cancer gene therapy.","Manome, Y;Wen, P Y;Dong, Y;Tanaka, T;Mitchell, B S;Kufe, D W;Fine, H A"
8616716,1996,Nature medicine,Effects of a selective inhibitor of the Abl tyrosine kinase on the growth of Bcr-Abl positive cells.,"The bcr-abl oncogene, present in 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), has been implicated as the cause of this disease. A compound, designed to inhibit the Abl protein tyrosine kinase, was evaluated for its effects on cells containing the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Cellular proliferation and tumor formation by Bcr-Abl-expressing cells were specifically inhibited by this compound. In colony-forming assays of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with CML, there was a 92-98% decrease in the number of bcr-abl colonies formed but no inhibition of normal colony formation. This compound may be useful in the treatment of bcr-abl-positive leukemias.","Druker, B J;Tamura, S;Buchdunger, E;Ohno, S;Segal, G M;Fanning, S;Zimmermann, J;Lydon, N B"
8597962,1996,Nature medicine,Phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography for observing biological soft tissues.,"Biological soft tissues are almost transparent to hard X rays and therefore cannot be investigated without enhancement with a contrast medium, such as iodine. On the other hand, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is sensitive to light elements (1-8). This is because the X-ray phase shift cross section is almost thousand times larger than the X-ray absorption cross section for light elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (4,5). Hence, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is a promising technique for observing the structure inside biological soft tissues without the need for staining and without serious radiation exposure. We have devised a means of observing biological tissues in three dimensions using a novel X-ray computed tomography (CT) by modifying the phase-contrast technique. To generate appropriate CT input data, we used phase-mapping images obtained using an X-ray interferometer (6) and computer analysis of interference patterns (9). Now, we present a three-dimensional observation result of a nonstained sample of a cancerous rabbit liver, using a synchrotron X-ray source. Phase-contrast X-ray CT was able to clearly differentiate the cancer lesion from the normal tissue. Moreover, fine structures corresponding to cancerous degeneration and fibrous tissues were clearly depicted.","Momose, A;Takeda, T;Itai, Y;Hirano, K"
8597958,1996,Nature medicine,Matrix metalloproteinase-1 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest malignant tumors and has a relatively poor prognosis. The outcome depends on the extent of local and particularly metastatic tumor spread. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of closely related enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix and are considered to be important in facilitating tumor invasion and spread (1-3). Using immunohistochemistry we have investigated the occurrence in colorectal cancer of MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase). Our monoclonal antibody was prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an amino acid sequence specific for MMP-1 and was selected to react in formalin-fixed wax-embedded sections, thus allowing use in diagnostic histopathology and also enabling access to archival material. We found that the presence of MMP-1 in colorectal cancer is associated with a poor prognosis (P = 0.006) and has prognostic value independent of Dukes stage. One MMP inhibitor that strongly inhibits MMP-1 has already been shown to inhibit growth of human colon cancer xenografts in nude mice (4). Our results suggest that treatment of those individuals whose colon tumors produce MMP-1 with MMP inhibitors is a therapeutic strategy worth pursuing.","Murray, G I;Duncan, M E;O'Neil, P;Melvin, W T;Fothergill, J E"
8597957,1996,Nature medicine,Acute alcohol intoxication suppresses natural killer cell activity and promotes tumor metastasis.,"Alcohol consumption is associated with increased morbidity and mortality related to infectious diseases and malignancy (1-5), although immune mediation of these relationships is controversial. Specifically, the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are involved in the resistance to infections and metastasis, can be suppressed in the presence of ethanol in vitro. However, acute consumption or infusion of ethanol in vivo exerts no effects on NK activity assessed in vitro thereafter. Therefore, we have developed and used a method to study the effects of ethanol on NK activity in living rats by using an NK-sensitive metastatic process and selective depletion of NK cells in vivo. Acute ethanol intoxication caused a marked suppression of NK activity in vivo and a tenfold increase in the number of MADB106 tumor metastases. Ethanol had no effect in rats selectively depleted of NK cells or when an NK-insensitive tumor (C4047) was used. These findings suggest that even acute ethanol intoxication markedly suppresses NK activity in the living organism. This suppression may underlie some aspects of the association between alcoholism, infectious disease and malignancies.","Ben-Eliyahu, S;Page, G G;Yirmiya, R;Taylor, A N"
8612238,1996,Nature medicine,Treatment of advanced solid tumors with immunotoxin LMB-1: an antibody linked to Pseudomonas exotoxin.,"Immunotoxin LMB-1 is composed of monoclonal antibody B3 chemically linked to PE38, a genetically engineered form of Pseudomonas exotoxin. B3 recognizes a carbohydrate antigen (Le(Y)) present on many human solid tumors. LMB-1 has excellent antitumor activity in nude mice bearing Le(Y)-positive tumors. We conducted a phase I study of 38 patients with solid tumors who failed conventional therapy and whose tumors expressed the Le(Y) antigen. Objective antitumor activity was observed in 5 patients, 18 had stable disease, 15 progressed. A complete remission was observed in a patient with metastatic breast cancer to supraclavicular nodes. A greater than 75% tumor reduction and resolution of all clinical symptoms lasting for more than six months was observed in a colon cancer patient with extensive retroperitoneal and cervical metastasis. Three patients (two colon, one breast cancer) had minor responses. The maximum tolerated dose of LMB-1 is 75 microgram/kg given intravenously three times every other day. The major toxicity is vascular leak syndrome manifested by hypoalbuminemia, fluid retention, hypotension and, in one case, pulmonary edema. Although immunotoxins have been evaluated in clinical studies for more than two decades, this is the first report of antitumor activity in epithelial tumors.","Pai, L H;Wittes, R;Setser, A;Willingham, M C;Pastan, I"
8612236,1996,Nature medicine,Lytic growth of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) in culture.,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the leading neoplasm of AIDS patients, and HIV infection is known to be a major risk factor for its development. However, KS can occur in the absence of HIV infection and the risk of KS development varies widely even among HIV-infected patients, with homosexual men with AIDS being 20 times more likely to develop KS than AIDS-afflicted children or hemophiliacs. These and other data strongly suggest that a sexually transmitted agent or co-factor may be involved in KS pathogenesis. Recently, DNA sequences corresponding to the genome of a novel member of the herpesvirus family have been identified within AIDS-KS biopsies, and several reports indicate that these sequences are also present in all forms of HIV-negative KS. These and other findings suggest this new agent, referred to as KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), as a candidate for the putative etiologic cofactor. However, the role of this agent in KS remains hotly debated. Further progress in understanding its biology has been severely hampered by the lack of a cell culture system for virus growth. Here we report the development of a system for the lytic growth of this virus in a latently infected B cell line and present the first ultrastructural visualization of the virus. This system will facilitate the detailed study of the molecular biology of viral replication, the testing of antiviral drugs and the development of diagnostic tests for viral infection.","Renne, R;Zhong, W;Herndier, B;McGrath, M;Abbey, N;Kedes, D;Ganem, D"
8612233,1996,Nature medicine,HMG-CoA reductase mediates the biological effects of retinoic acid on human neuroblastoma cells: lovastatin specifically targets P-glycoprotein-expressing cells.,"The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, involved in de novo cholesterol synthesis and cell-cycle progression, was identified as a potential mediator of the growth inhibitory effects of retinoic acid on human neuroblastoma. Lovastatin, a nonreversible inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induced extensive cytotoxicity that was restricted to drug-resistant P-glycoprotein-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines. This response was potentiated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP but not retinoic acid. Patients with advanced-stage metastatic neuroblastoma often display an acquired chemoresistant phenotype, which may in part be mediated by P-glycoprotein. Our studies support the application or use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of these patients who are refractory to chemotherapy.","Dimitroulakos, J;Yeger, H"
8612232,1996,Nature medicine,"Accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of human brain tumors by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","Although conventional proton magnetic resonance imaging has increased our ability to detect brain tumors, it has not enhanced to nearly the same degree our ability to diagnose tumor type. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a safe, noninvasive means of performing biochemical analysis in vivo. Using this technique, we characterized and classified tissue from normal brains, as well as tissue from the five most common types of adult supratentorial brain tumors. These six tissue types differed in their pattern across the six metabolites measured. 'Leaving-one-out' linear discriminant analyses based on these resonance profiles correctly classified 104 of 105 spectra, and, whereas conventional preoperative clinical diagnosis misclassified 20 of 91 tumors, the linear discriminant analysis approach missed only 1. Thus, we have found that a pattern-recognition analysis of the biochemical information obtained from proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can enable accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of the most prevalent types of supratentorial brain tumors.","Preul, M C;Caramanos, Z;Collins, D L;Villemure, J G;Leblanc, R;Olivier, A;Pokrupa, R;Arnold, D L"
8574972,1996,Nature medicine,Retinoic acid normalizes the increased gene transcription rate of TGF-alpha and EGFR in head and neck cancer cell lines.,"Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be effective in eradicating premalignant lesions and preventing second primary malignancies in patients cured of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in clinical trials. The basis for this effect is unclear. We have previously demonstrated that messenger RNA from tumor growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and its receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGFR), is unregulated in tumors and histologically normal mucosal samples from patients with SCCHN compared with control normal mucosa from patients without cancer, implicating this ligand-receptor pair in an autocrine growth pathway early in the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. In this report, we examined the hypothesis that the action of RA on the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract is mediated via downregulation of steady-state TGF-alpha and/or EGFR mRNA levels. Following exposure to all-trans-RA, a series of SCCHN cell lines demonstrated a 35.4% reduction in TGF-alpha mRNA expression (P = 0.022) and 58.5% reduction in EGFR mRNA (P = 0.0027). Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that the RA-mediated reduction of TGF-alpha and EGFR steady-state mRNA levels was a result of decreased gene transcription. These results suggest that the clinical effects of RA in SCCHN patients may be due to a downmodulation of TGF-alpha and EGFR mRNA production.","Rubin Grandis, J;Zeng, Q;Tweardy, D J"
8574967,1996,Nature medicine,In situ detection of tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells: correlation with the malignant phenotype of human breast disease.,"Expression of tissue factor (TF) in the endothelium has been observed only rarely in human disease and has been thought to be elaborated on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in vitro as an artifact of tissue culture. Using monoclonal antibodies and a novel probe for functional TF, we have localized TF to the VECs (and tumor cells) within the tumors of seven patients with invasive breast cancer but not in the VECs (or tumor cells) of benign tumors from ten patients with fibrocystic disease of the breast. The potent procoagulant TF was shown to be a marker of the initiation of angiogenesis in human breast cancer. Further evidence that the TF was the demonstration of a similar distribution of cross-linked fibrin only in the VECs of the malignant tumors. We interpret these data as further support for the concept that tumor cells can activate nearby VECs and regulate blood vessel growth in vivo. Large clinical pathologic studies will be necessary to determine whether TF is a useful marker for the ""switch"" to the angiogenic phenotype"" in human breast disease and/or correlates with the thromboembolic complications of breast cancer.","Contrino, J;Hair, G;Kreutzer, D L;Rickles, F R"
8574961,1996,Nature medicine,Analysis of mismatch repair genes in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer patients.,"Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the early onset of colorectal cancer and linked to germline defects in at least four mismatch repair genes. Although much has been learned about the molecular pathogenesis of this disease, questions related to effective presymptomatic diagnosis are largely unanswered because of its genetic complexity. In this study, we evaluated tumors from 74 HNPCC kindreds for genomic instability characteristic of a mismatch repair deficiency and found such instability in 92% of the kindreds. The entire coding regions of the five known human mismatch repair genes were evaluated in 48 kindreds with instability, and mutations were identified in 70%. This study demonstrates that a combination of techniques can be used to genetically diagnose tumor susceptibility in the majority of HNPCC kindreds and lays the foundation for genetic testing of this relatively common disease.","Liu, B;Parsons, R;Papadopoulos, N;Nicolaides, N C;Lynch, H T;Watson, P;Jass, J R;Dunlop, M;Wyllie, A;Peltomäki, P;de la Chapelle, A;Hamilton, S R;Vogelstein, B;Kinzler, K W"

Four patients with follicular B-cell lymphoma received a series of three or four infusions of antigen-pulsed dendritic cells followed, in each instance, by subcutaneous injections of soluble antigen two weeks later.

7489412,1995,Nature medicine,Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pulsed with synthetic tumour peptides elicit protective and therapeutic antitumour immunity.,"Dendritic cells, the most potent 'professional' antigen-presenting cells, hold promise for improving the immunotherapy of cancer. In three different well-characterized tumour models, naive mice injected with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells prepulsed with tumour-associated peptides previously characterized as being recognized by class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, developed a specific T-lymphocyte response and were protected against a subsequent lethal tumour challenge. Moreover, in the C3 sarcoma and the 3LL lung carcinoma murine models, treatment of animals bearing established macroscopic tumours (up to 1 cm2 in size) with tumour peptide-pulsed dendritic cells resulted in sustained tumour regression and tumour-free status in more than 80% of cases. These results support the clinical use of tumour peptide-pulsed dendritic cells as components in developing effective cancer vaccines and therapies.","Mayordomo, J I;Zorina, T;Storkus, W J;Zitvogel, L;Celluzzi, C;Falo, L D;Melief, C J;Ildstad, S T;Kast, W M;Deleo, A B"

Recently, sequences of a new human herpesvirus, KSHV/HHV-8, have been identified in both HIV-associated and classical KS. We sought to identify the target cell of this virus in KS tumour tissue. Using PCR in situ hybridization (PCR-ISH) we show that KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the flat endothelial cells lining vascular spaces of KS lesions as well as in typical KS spindle cells. These findings show that KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the cell types thought to represent neoplastic cells in these lesions.","Boshoff, C;Schulz, T F;Kennedy, M M;Graham, A K;Fisher, C;Thomas, A;McGee, J O;Weiss, R A;O'Leary, J J"

Using in situ hybridizations on a cohort of 94 biopsy lesions, quantitatively increased cyclin D mRNA expression levels were observed in only 18% of benign lesions, which confer no or slightly increased breast cancer risk, and 18% of premalignant atypical ductal hyperplasias, which confer a four to fivefold increase in breast cancer risk. The transition to carcinoma was accompanied by frequent cyclin D mRNA overexpression in 76% of low-grade ductal carcinomas in situ, 87% of higher grade comedo ductal carcinomas in situ and 83% of infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas. The data identify a molecular event that may separate benign and premalignant human breast lesions from any form of breast carcinoma.","Weinstat-Saslow, D;Merino, M J;Manrow, R E;Lawrence, J A;Bluth, R F;Wittenbel, K D;Simpson, J F;Page, D L;Steeg, P S"
7584999,1995,Nature medicine,Radiotherapy for genes that cause cancer.,"Many approaches to cancer gene radiotherapy are possible. Even existing strategies, devised with other goals in mind, can cause radiosensitization by altering the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumour cells or by modifying the tumour microenvironment. Small increases in the levels of radiosensitization could, over a fractionated radiation course, have major effects on the probability of tumour cure. The clinical application of gene radiotherapy will require use of in vivo gene delivery systems that still need validation but, because radiation is effective at decreasing tumour burden, genes will not have to be expressed in all cells in order to achieve a cure.","McBride, W H;Dougherty, G J"

Mutation 1, originally detected as a 165-base pair deletion in MLH1 cDNA comprising exon 16, was shown to consist of a 3.5-kilobase genomic deletion most likely resulting from Alu-mediated recombination. Mutation 2 destroys the splice acceptor site of exon 6. A simple diagnostic test based on polymerase chain reaction was designed for both mutations. Our results show that these two ancestral founding mutations account for a majority of Finnish HNPCC kindreds and represent the first report of Alu-mediated recombination causing a prevalent, dominantly inherited predisposition to cancer.","Nyström-Lahti, M;Kristo, P;Nicolaides, N C;Chang, S Y;Aaltonen, L A;Moisio, A L;Järvinen, H J;Mecklin, J P;Kinzler, K W;Vogelstein, B"
7584991,1995,Nature medicine,Regression of established murine carcinoma metastases following vaccination with tumour-associated antigen peptides.,"The cure of micrometastases following surgery is the major goal of cancer immunotherapy. We have recently isolated tumour-associated antigen (TAA) peptides, MUT 1 and MUT 2, derived from a mutated connexin 37 gap-junction protein, from the malignant 3LL-D122 murine lung carcinoma. We now report that synthetic MUT 1 or MUT 2 induces effective antitumour cytoxic T lymphocytes. Peptide vaccines protect mice from spontaneous metastases of 3LL-D122 tumours. Moreover, peptide vaccines reduce metastatic loads in mice carrying pre-established micrometastases. Tumour-specific immunity was primarily mediated by CD8+ T cells. This is the first evidence that peptide therapy may be effective in treatment of residual tumours and provides a rationale for the development of peptide vaccines as a modality for cancer therapy.","Mandelboim, O;Vadai, E;Fridkin, M;Katz-Hillel, A;Feldman, M;Berke, G;Eisenbach, L"

In follow-up studies conducted with athymic mice carrying human melanomas, tumour growth was completely inhibited without toxicity. As judged by a variety of cellular responses, antitumour activity was mediated by the induction of apoptosis.

Purification and characterization revealed the inhibitor to be spermine, a polyamine known to be locally abundant in the prostate. These results suggest that endogenous polyamine can negatively regulate the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site in vivo and may explain the slow rate of primary tumour expansion in the prostate.","Smith, R C;Litwin, M S;Lu, Y;Zetter, B R"
7489359,1995,Nature medicine,Individual development and uPA-receptor expression of disseminated tumour cells in bone marrow: a reference to early systemic disease in solid cancer.,"It is unclear whether disseminated tumour cells detected in bone marrow in early stages of solid cancers indicate a subclinical systemic disease component determining the patient's fate or simply represent mainly irrelevant shed cells. Moreover, characteristics differentiating high and low metastatic potential of disseminated tumour cells are not defined. We performed repeated serial bone marrow biopsies during follow-up in operated gastric cancer patients. Most patients with later tumour relapse revealed either an increase or a constantly high number of tumour cells. In contrast, in patients without recurrence, either clearance of tumour cells or negative or low cell counts were seen. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-receptor expression on disseminated tumour cells was significantly correlated with increasing tumour cell counts and clinical prognosis. These results demonstrate a systemic component in early solid cancer, indicated by early systemically disseminated tumour cells, which may predict individual disease development.","Heiss, M M;Allgayer, H;Gruetzner, K U;Funke, I;Babic, R;Jauch, K W;Schildberg, F W"

Endothelin-1, more commonly known as a potent vasoconstrictor, is a normal ejaculate protein that also stimulates osteoblasts. We show here that plasma immunoreactive endothelin concentrations are significantly elevated in men with metastatic prostate cancer and that every human prostate cancer cell line tested produces endothelin-1 messenger RNA and secretes immunoreactive endothelin. Exogenous endothelin-1 is a prostate cancer mitogen in vitro and increases alkaline phosphatase activity in new bone formation, indicating that ectopic endothelin-1 may be a mediator of the osteoblastic response of bone to metastatic prostate cancer.","Nelson, J B;Hedican, S P;George, D J;Reddi, A H;Piantadosi, S;Eisenberger, M A;Simons, J W"

G207 has deletions at both gamma 34.5 (RL1) loci and a lacZ gene insertion inactivating the ICP6 gene (UL39). G207 kills human glioma cells in monolayer cultures. In nude mice harbouring subcutaneous or intracerebral U-87MG gliomas, intraneoplastic inoculation with G207 causes decreased tumour growth and/or prolonged survival. G207 is avirulent upon intracerebral inoculation of mice and HSV-sensitive non-human primates. These results suggest that G207 should be considered for clinical evaluation in the treatment of glioblastomas.","Mineta, T;Rabkin, S D;Yazaki, T;Hunter, W D;Martuza, R L"
7585215,1995,Nature medicine,Microallelotyping defines the sequence and tempo of allelic losses at tumour suppressor gene loci during colorectal cancer progression.,"Microallelotyping of many regions from individual colorectal tumours was used to determine the sequence and tempo of allelic loss on 5q, 17p and 18q during neoplastic progression. No allelic losses were found in normal tissues surrounding colorectal neoplasms, but losses occurred abruptly on 5q at the transition from normal colonic epithelium to the benign adenoma, and on 17p at the transition from adenoma to carcinoma, indicating an essential role for these losses in tumour progression. Allelic losses were uniform throughout extensively microdissected benign adenomas and carcinomas. However, substantial allelic heterogeneity was found in high-grade dysplasia, the transition lesion between adenoma and carcinoma. Thus, allelic losses on 5q and 17p are associated with abrupt waves of clonal neoplastic expansion, and high-grade dysplasia is characterized by a high degree of allelic heterogeneity.","Boland, C R;Sato, J;Appelman, H D;Bresalier, R S;Feinberg, A P"
7585188,1995,Nature medicine,Evidence of an X-linked or recessive genetic component to prostate cancer risk.,"We used data from a population-based cohort study of blacks, Hispanics, Japanese and whites to examine the frequency of prevalent prostate and breast cancer by family history status of first-degree relatives (parents and siblings). Independent of race, the age-adjusted relative risk for prevalent prostate cancer in subjects with affected brothers was approximately two times that in subjects with affected fathers (P < 0.00005). No such excess risk for breast cancer was observed among subjects with affected sisters compared to those with affected mothers (age- and race-adjusted relative risk = 1.10, P = 0.34). The magnitude of the relative risk for prostate cancer in sibling- versus parent-affected groups was significantly different from that of the comparable relative risk for breast cancer (P < 0.00005). An excess risk of prostate cancer in men with affected brothers compared to those with affected fathers is consistent with the hypothesis of an X-linked, or recessive, model of inheritance.","Monroe, K R;Yu, M C;Kolonel, L N;Coetzee, G A;Wilkens, L R;Ross, R K;Henderson, B E"

Mutation or loss of both VHL alleles has been documented in sporadic renal cell carcinomas and in the neoplasms that arise in von Hippel-Lindau kindreds. We have determined that the protein product of the VHL gene is an approximately 30 kilodalton cytoplasmic protein. The renal carcinoma cell line 786-O is known to harbour a VHL mutation and, as shown here, fails to produce a wild-type VHL protein. Reintroduction of wild-type, but not mutant, VHL into these cells had no demonstrable effect on their growth in vitro but inhibited their ability to form tumours in nude mice.","Iliopoulos, O;Kibel, A;Gray, S;Kaelin, W G"
7585182,1995,Nature medicine,Inhibition of farnesyltransferase induces regression of mammary and salivary carcinomas in ras transgenic mice.,"For Ras oncoproteins to transform mammalian cells, they must be post-translationally modified with a farnesyl group in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase). Inhibitors of FPTase have therefore been proposed as anti-cancer agents. We show that L-744,832, which mimics the CaaX motif to which the farnesyl group is added, is a potent and selective inhibitor of FPTase. In MMTV-v-Ha-ras mice bearing palpable tumours, daily administration of L-744,832 caused tumour regression. Following cessation of treatment, tumours reappeared, the majority of which regressed upon retreatment. No systemic toxicity was found upon necropsy of L-744,832-treated mice. This first demonstration of anti-FPTase-mediated tumour regression suggests that FPTase inhibitors may be safe and effective anti-tumour agents in some cancers.","Kohl, N E;Omer, C A;Conner, M W;Anthony, N J;Davide, J P;deSolms, S J;Giuliani, E A;Gomez, R P;Graham, S L;Hamilton, K"

Combined treatment with Ad5.Egr-TNF and 5,000 cGy (rad) resulted in increased intratumoral TNF-alpha production and increased tumour control compared with treatment with Ad5.Egr-TNF alone or with radiation alone. The increase in tumour control was achieved without an increase in normal tissue damage when compared to tissue injury from radiation alone. Control of gene transcription by ionizing radiation in vivo represents a novel method of spatial and temporal regulation of gene-based medical treatments.","Hallahan, D E;Mauceri, H J;Seung, L P;Dunphy, E J;Wayne, J D;Hanna, N N;Toledano, A;Hellman, S;Kufe, D W;Weichselbaum, R R"
7585156,1995,Nature medicine,A role for a new herpes virus (KSHV) in different forms of Kaposi's sarcoma.,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a previously rare, tumour-like lesion of controversial biological nature. KS has since the early 1980s become frequent in patients with AIDS, particularly in homosexuals. KS is also endemic in Central Africa predominantly in otherwise healthy men but also in women and children. Recently, evidence for the presence of novel, herpes virus DNA sequences in more than 90% of AIDS Kaposi lesions (AKS) was presented. This DNA was identified using representational difference analysis (RDA) generating short, unique sequences with variable homology to several herpes virus, but no intact virus was recovered. If these DNA-sequences are also present in other, non-HIV-associated forms of Kaposi's sarcoma this would strongly suggest a specific, aetiopathological involvement of this putative new herpes virus in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, rather than a contamination of yet another opportunistic virus in immunosuppressed AIDS patients.","Schalling, M;Ekman, M;Kaaya, E E;Linde, A;Biberfeld, P"
7585154,1995,Nature medicine,Serum p53 antibodies as early markers of lung cancer.,"The p53 alteration is the most common alteration found in human cancer. It usually involves missense mutations that stabilize the p53 protein, which in turn accumulates, reaching levels detectable by immunohistochemistry. We and others have demonstrated that this overexpression of mutant p53 protein can induce a specific humoral response in cancer patients. This result was assessed by the presence of p53 antibodies in sera of patients with various types of cancers, whereas normal populations do not exhibit such antibodies. In lung cancer, the prevalence of p53 antibodies is high (30%) and is correlated with a very high rate of p53 mutations in this cancer (60-70%). We show that these antibodies are always present at the time of diagnosis, but never appear during tumour development, an observation strengthened by the fact that these antibodies are mostly IgG, corresponding to a secondary immune response. These results suggest that the humoral response is an early event and that p53 antibodies can be used as a precocious marker of p53 alteration before clinical manifestation of the disease.","Lubin, R;Zalcman, G;Bouchet, L;Trédanel, J;Legros, Y;Cazals, D;Hirsch, A;Soussi, T"
7585145,1995,Nature medicine,Targeting antigen into the phagocytic pathway in vivo induces protective tumour immunity.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill neoplastic or virally infected cells after recognizing on their surface antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. These peptides are derived from antigens that are degraded in the cytosol of the affected cell. Because exogenous proteins cannot enter the cytosol, immunizations with killed pathogens or their proteins do not generally elicit CTLs. However, antigens that are internalized into phagocytic cells can enter the cytosol and be processed for class I presentation. Here we show that immunization with a purified antigen on an avidly phagocytized particle primes CTLs, which in turn protect animals from subsequent challenge with tumours transfected with the antigen gene. Interestingly, these animals also become immune to other antigens expressed by the tumour. This approach could be exploited to develop tumour and viral vaccines.","Falo, L D;Kovacsovics-Bankowski, M;Thompson, K;Rock, K L"
7585144,1995,Nature medicine,Prevention of breast tumour development in vivo by downregulation of the p185neu receptor.,"Certain strains of transgenic mice that express the rat neu oncogene (neuT) in mammary epithelial cells develop breast tumours at an average of 44 weeks of age. In this study, intraperitoneal injection of a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody specific for the rat neuT oncogene product dramatically affected tumour development in these transgenic mice in a dose-dependent manner. A significant proportion (50%) of mice, when injected with anti-receptor antibodies, did not develop tumours even after 90 weeks of age. The phosphotyrosine levels of the membrane fraction of breast tissues in the anti-receptor antibody-treated mice were almost completely abolished when a higher dose of antibodies was used. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that immunologic manipulation of an oncogene product can effectively prevent the development of tumours in a rodent transgenic model.","Katsumata, M;Okudaira, T;Samanta, A;Clark, D P;Drebin, J A;Jolicoeur, P;Greene, M I"
7585143,1995,Nature medicine,"Effects of the MYC oncogene antagonist, MAD, on proliferation, cell cycling and the malignant phenotype of human brain tumour cells.","To investigate how overexpression of MAD, an antagonist of MYC oncogenes influences the malignant phenotype of human cancer cells, an adenovirus vector system was used to transfer the human MAD gene (AdMAD) into human astrocytoma cells. Decreased growth potential of AdMAD-infected cells was evidenced by a decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation, an increase in cell doubling time and alteration of cell-cycle distribution. Diminished malignant potential of AdMAD-infected cells was manifested by their loss of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and by their inability, in general, to induce tumorigenesis in a xenograft animal model. These studies indicate that adenovirus constructs encoding MAD dramatically inhibit the proliferation and tumorigenicity of human astrocytoma cells and support the use of MAD for gene therapy of human tumours.","Chen, J;Willingham, T;Margraf, L R;Schreiber-Agus, N;DePinho, R A;Nisen, P D"
7585118,1995,Nature medicine,A single-injection protein kinase A-directed antisense treatment to inhibit tumour growth.,"Expression of the RI alpha subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I is enhanced in human cancer cell lines, in primary tumours, in cells after transformation and in cells upon stimulation of growth. We have investigated the effect of sequence-specific inhibition of RI alpha gene expression on in vivo tumour growth. We report that single injection RI alpha antisense treatment results in a reduction in RI alpha expression and inhibition of tumour growth. Tumour cells behaved like untransformed cells by making less protein kinase type I. The RI alpha antisense, which produces a biochemical imprint for growth control, requires infrequent dosing to halt neoplastic growth in vivo.","Nesterova, M;Cho-Chung, Y S"
7585097,1995,Nature medicine,A recombinant Listeria monocytogenes vaccine expressing a model tumour antigen protects mice against lethal tumour cell challenge and causes regression of established tumours.,"Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular organism that has the unusual ability to live in the cytoplasm of the cell. It is thus a good vector for targeting protein antigens to the cellular arm of the immune response. Here we use a model system, consisting of colon and renal carcinomas that express the influenza virus nucleoprotein and a recombinant L. monocytogenes that secrets this antigen, to test the potential of this organism as a cancer immunotherapeutic agent. We show that this recombinant organism can not only protect mice against lethal challenge with tumour cells that express the antigen, but can also cause regression of established macroscopic tumours in an antigen-specific T-cell-dependent manner.","Pan, Z K;Ikonomidis, G;Lazenby, A;Pardoll, D;Paterson, Y"
7585096,1995,Nature medicine,The association of an HPV16 oncogene variant with HLA-B7 has implications for vaccine design in cervical cancer.,"HLA-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogene products may be important in the control of the HPV infections associated with the development of cervical cancer. We have identified, in HLA-B7 individuals, a consistent variation in the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein sequence, which alters an HLA-B7 peptide binding epitope in a way likely to influence immune recognition by CTLs. These results illustrate a biologically relevant mechanism for escape from immune surveillance of HPV16 in HLA-B7 individuals. Thus, both HLA type and HPV16 strain variation need to be considered in the screening of at-risk individuals and for the rational design of anti-HPV vaccines.","Ellis, J R;Keating, P J;Baird, J;Hounsell, E F;Renouf, D V;Rowe, M;Hopkins, D;Duggan-Keen, M F;Bartholomew, J S;Young, L S"
7585065,1995,Nature medicine,Genetic instability occurs in the majority of young patients with colorectal cancer.,"Replication errors (RER) associated with genetic instability have been found in cancers of several different types and particularly in the tumours of patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). We have here determined the prevalence of such instability in relation to age among patients without HNPCC. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) in the majority of patients 35 years of age or younger exhibited instability (58% of 31 patients), whereas CRCs from patients older than 35 uncommonly did (12% of 158, p < 0.0001). Twelve of the patients under 35 with instability were evaluated for alterations of mismatch repair genes, and five were found to harbour germline mutations. These data suggest that the mechanisms underlying tumour development in young CRC patients differ from those in most older patients, regardless of HNPCC status. The results have important implications for genetic testing and management of young CRC patients and their families.","Liu, B;Farrington, S M;Petersen, G M;Hamilton, S R;Parsons, R;Papadopoulos, N;Fujiwara, T;Jen, J;Kinzler, K W;Wyllie, A H;Vogelstein, B;Dunlop, M G"

7585044,1995,Nature medicine,Rotenoids mediate potent cancer chemopreventive activity through transcriptional regulation of ornithine decarboxylase.,"For the discovery of new cancer chemopreventive agents, we have studied the potential of plant extracts to inhibit phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in cell culture. Four active rotenoids were obtained from the African plant Mundulea sericea (Leguminosae). These isolates were highly potent when evaluated for inhibition of chemically induced preneoplastic lesions in mammary organ culture and inhibition of papillomas in the two-stage mouse skin model, and they appear to function by a unique mechanism at the level of ODC messenger RNA expression. Based on our findings, rotenoids can be regarded as promising new chemopreventive or anticancer agents.","Gerhäuser, C;Mar, W;Lee, S K;Suh, N;Luo, Y;Kosmeder, J;Luyengi, L;Fong, H H;Kinghorn, A D;Moriarty, R M"
7585042,1995,Nature medicine,Correlating telomerase activity levels with human neuroblastoma outcomes.,"Telomerase activity was analysed in 100 neuroblastoma cases. Although telomerase activity was not detected in normal adrenal tissues or benign ganglioneuromas, almost all neuroblastomas (94%) did express it, suggesting an important role for telomerase in neuroblastoma development. Neuroblastomas with high telomerase activity had other genetic changes (for example, N-myc amplification) and an unfavourable prognosis, whereas tumours with low telomerase activity were devoid of such genetic alterations and were associated with a favourable prognosis. Three neuroblastomas lacking telomerase activity regressed (stage IVS). Thus telomerase expression may be required as a critical step in the multigenetic process of tumorigenesis, and two different pathways may exist for the development of neuroblastoma.","Hiyama, E;Hiyama, K;Yokoyama, T;Matsuura, Y;Piatyszek, M A;Shay, J W"
7585012,1995,Nature medicine,Dormancy of micrometastases: balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the presence of angiogenesis suppression.,"In cancer patients, dormant micrometastases are often asymptomatic and clinically undetectable, for months or years, until relapse. We have studied dormant lung metastases under angiogenesis suppression in mice. The metastases exhibited rapid growth when the inhibition of angiogenesis was removed. Tumour cell proliferation, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemical staining proliferating cell nuclear antigen, was not significantly different in dormant and growing metastases. However, tumour cells of dormant metastases exhibited a more than threefold higher incidence of apoptosis. These data show that metastases remain dormant when tumour cell proliferation is balanced by an equivalent rate of cell death and suggest that angiogenesis inhibitors control metastatic growth by indirectly increasing apoptosis in tumour cells.","Holmgren, L;O'Reilly, M S;Folkman, J"
7584960,1995,Nature medicine,"Elimination of Ehrlich tumours by ATP-induced growth inhibition, glutathione depletion and X-rays.","ATP-induced tumour growth inhibition is accompanied by a selective decrease in the content of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) within the cancer cells in vivo. Depletion of cellular GSH sensitizes tumours to chemotherapy and radiation, but the usefulness of this depletion depends on whether the levels of GSH can be reduced in the tumour relative to normal tissues. We report here that administration of ATP in combination with diethylmaleate and X-rays leads to complete regression of 95% of Ehrlich ascites tumours in mice. This shows that an aggressive tumour can be eliminated by using a therapy based on modulation of GSH levels in cancer cells.","Estrela, J M;Obrador, E;Navarro, J;Lasso De la Vega, M C;Pellicer, J A"
7584955,1995,Nature medicine,Microsatellite instability in primary neoplasms from HIV + patients.,"AIDS is associated with a high risk of certain malignancies, notably Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The pathogenesis of these malignancies is not fully understood. One mechanism of malignant transformation recently described in colon tumorigenesis results from defects in DNA mismatch repair, manifest as widespread microsatellite instability. We demonstrate a high rate of microsatellite instability in KS and aggressive lymphomas obtained from HIV-infected patients, whereas there is no evidence of instability in similar lesions from HIV-negative patients. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for HIV-associated instability in primary tumours may provide insight into the pathogenesis of these AIDS-related neoplasms.","Bedi, G C;Westra, W H;Farzadegan, H;Pitha, P M;Sidransky, D"

It is now helpful to think of the switch to the angiogenic phenotype as a net balance of positive and negative regulators of blood vessel growth. The extent to which the negative regulators are decreased during this switch may dictate whether a primary tumour grows rapidly or slowly and whether metastases grow at all.","Folkman, J"
