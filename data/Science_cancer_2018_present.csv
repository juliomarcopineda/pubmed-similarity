The mechanisms underlying tumor LN metastasis are poorly understood. By using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN-metastatic tumors in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that tumor cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN-metastatic tumors, leading to the up-regulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids accumulated to high levels in the metastatic LNs, and these bile acids activated YAP in tumor cells, likely through the nuclear vitamin D receptor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating tumor metastasis to LNs.","Lee, Choong-Kun;Jeong, Seung-Hwan;Jang, Cholsoon;Bae, Hosung;Kim, Yoo Hyung;Park, Intae;Kim, Sang Kyum;Koh, Gou Young"

We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model. Therefore, molecularly targeted agents capable of inducing senescence can produce tumor control through non-cell autonomous mechanisms involving NK cell surveillance.","Ruscetti, Marcus;Leibold, Josef;Bott, Matthew J;Fennell, Myles;Kulick, Amanda;Salgado, Nelson R;Chen, Chi-Chao;Ho, Yu-Jui;Sanchez-Rivera, Francisco J;Feucht, Judith;Baslan, Timour;Tian, Sha;Chen, Hsuan-An;Romesser, Paul B;Poirier, John T;Rudin, Charles M;de Stanchina, Elisa;Manchado, Eusebio;Sherr, Charles J;Lowe, Scott W"

Its clinical course ranges from spontaneous tumor regression to fatal progression. To investigate the molecular features of the divergent tumor subtypes, we performed genome sequencing on 416 pretreatment neuroblastomas and assessed telomere maintenance mechanisms in 208 of these tumors. We found that patients whose tumors lacked telomere maintenance mechanisms had an excellent prognosis, whereas the prognosis of patients whose tumors harbored telomere maintenance mechanisms was substantially worse. Survival rates were lowest for neuroblastoma patients whose tumors harbored telomere maintenance mechanisms in combination with RAS and/or p53 pathway mutations. Spontaneous tumor regression occurred both in the presence and absence of these mutations in patients with telomere maintenance-negative tumors. On the basis of these data, we propose a mechanistic classification of neuroblastoma that may benefit the clinical management of patients.","Ackermann, Sandra;Cartolano, Maria;Hero, Barbara;Welte, Anne;Kahlert, Yvonne;Roderwieser, Andrea;Bartenhagen, Christoph;Walter, Esther;Gecht, Judith;Kerschke, Laura;Volland, Ruth;Menon, Roopika;Heuckmann, Johannes M;Gartlgruber, Moritz;Hartlieb, Sabine;Henrich, Kai-Oliver;Okonechnikov, Konstantin;Altmüller, Janine;Nürnberg, Peter;Lefever, Steve;de Wilde, Bram;Sand, Frederik;Ikram, Fakhera;Rosswog, Carolina;Fischer, Janina;Theissen, Jessica;Hertwig, Falk;Singhi, Aatur D;Simon, Thorsten;Vogel, Wenzel;Perner, Sven;Krug, Barbara;Schmidt, Matthias;Rahmann, Sven;Achter, Viktor;Lang, Ulrich;Vokuhl, Christian;Ortmann, Monika;Büttner, Reinhard;Eggert, Angelika;Speleman, Frank;O'Sullivan, Roderick J;Thomas, Roman K;Berthold, Frank;Vandesompele, Jo;Schramm, Alexander;Westermann, Frank;Schulte, Johannes H;Peifer, Martin;Fischer, Matthias"

Using optimized single-cell multiomics sequencing together with multiregional sampling of the primary tumor and lymphatic and distant metastases, we developed insights beyond intratumoral heterogeneity. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 patients whose DNA we sequenced. The cancer cells' DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue and those of repetitive element long interspersed nuclear element 1.

We report the evaluation of >300 patient samples across 22 tumor types from four KEYNOTE clinical trials. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a T cell-inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) exhibited joint predictive utility in identifying responders and nonresponders to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. TMB and GEP were independently predictive of response and demonstrated low correlation, suggesting that they capture distinct features of neoantigenicity and T cell activation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed TMB and GEP to have a low correlation, and analysis by joint stratification revealed biomarker-defined patterns of targetable-resistance biology. These biomarkers may have utility in clinical trial design by guiding rational selection of anti-PD-1 monotherapy and combination immunotherapy regimens.","Cristescu, Razvan;Mogg, Robin;Ayers, Mark;Albright, Andrew;Murphy, Erin;Yearley, Jennifer;Sher, Xinwei;Liu, Xiao Qiao;Lu, Hongchao;Nebozhyn, Michael;Zhang, Chunsheng;Lunceford, Jared K;Joe, Andrew;Cheng, Jonathan;Webber, Andrea L;Ibrahim, Nageatte;Plimack, Elizabeth R;Ott, Patrick A;Seiwert, Tanguy Y;Ribas, Antoni;McClanahan, Terrill K;Tomassini, Joanne E;Loboda, Andrey;Kaufman, David"

SCNC patients have a dismal prognosis due in part to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving this malignancy and the lack of effective treatments. Here, we demonstrate that a common set of defined oncogenic drivers reproducibly reprograms normal human prostate and lung epithelial cells to small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively.

30262472,2018.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice.,"Cancer cells from a primary tumor can disseminate to other tissues, remaining dormant and clinically undetectable for many years. Little is known about the cues that cause these dormant cells to awaken, resume proliferating, and develop into metastases. Studying mouse models, we found that sustained lung inflammation caused by tobacco smoke exposure or nasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide converted disseminated, dormant cancer cells to aggressively growing metastases. Sustained inflammation induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and these were required for awakening dormant cancer. Mechanistic analysis revealed that two NET-associated proteases, neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9, sequentially cleaved laminin. The proteolytically remodeled laminin induced proliferation of dormant cancer cells by activating integrin α3β1 signaling. Antibodies against NET-remodeled laminin prevented awakening of dormant cells. Therapies aimed at preventing dormant cell awakening could potentially prolong the survival of cancer patients.","Albrengues, Jean;Shields, Mario A;Ng, David;Park, Chun Gwon;Ambrico, Alexandra;Poindexter, Morgan E;Upadhyay, Priya;Uyeminami, Dale L;Pommier, Arnaud;Küttner, Victoria;Bružas, Emilis;Maiorino, Laura;Bautista, Carmelita;Carmona, Ellese M;Gimotty, Phyllis A;Fearon, Douglas T;Chang, Kenneth;Lyons, Scott K;Pinkerton, Kent E;Trotman, Lloyd C;Goldberg, Michael S;Yeh, Johannes T-H;Egeblad, Mikala"

Although genomic heterogeneity within primary tumors is associated with relapse, heterogeneity among treatment-naïve metastases has not been comprehensively assessed. We analyzed sequencing data for 76 untreated metastases from 20 patients and inferred cancer phylogenies for breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, lung, melanoma, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. We found that within individual patients, a large majority of driver gene mutations are common to all metastases. Further analysis revealed that the driver gene mutations that were not shared by all metastases are unlikely to have functional consequences. A mathematical model of tumor evolution and metastasis formation provides an explanation for the observed driver gene homogeneity. Thus, single biopsies capture most of the functionally important mutations in metastases and therefore provide essential information for therapeutic decision-making.","Reiter, Johannes G;Makohon-Moore, Alvin P;Gerold, Jeffrey M;Heyde, Alexander;Attiyeh, Marc A;Kohutek, Zachary A;Tokheim, Collin J;Brown, Alexia;DeBlasio, Rayne M;Niyazov, Juliana;Zucker, Amanda;Karchin, Rachel;Kinzler, Kenneth W;Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A;Vogelstein, Bert;Nowak, Martin A"

To enable dynamic encoding, temporal information must be accurately transmitted from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. We used optogenetic profiling to show that both oncogenic B-Raf mutations and B-Raf inhibitors can cause corruption of this transmission, so that short pulses of input Ras activity are distorted into abnormally long Erk outputs. These changes can reshape downstream transcription and cell fates, resulting in improper decisions to proliferate. These findings illustrate how altered dynamic signal transmission properties, and not just constitutively increased signaling, can contribute to cell proliferation and perhaps cancer, and how optogenetic profiling can dissect mechanisms of signaling dysfunction in disease.","Bugaj, L J;Sabnis, A J;Mitchell, A;Garbarino, J E;Toettcher, J E;Bivona, T G;Lim, W A"

Antitumor immunity was mediated mainly by natural killer (NK) cells through activation of NKG2D and CD16 Fc receptors. This approach prevents the loss of important immunostimulatory ligands by human cancers and reactivates antitumor immunity.","Ferrari de Andrade, Lucas;Tay, Rong En;Pan, Deng;Luoma, Adrienne M;Ito, Yoshinaga;Badrinath, Soumya;Tsoucas, Daphne;Franz, Bettina;May, Kenneth F;Harvey, Christopher J;Kobold, Sebastian;Pyrdol, Jason W;Yoon, Charles;Yuan, Guo-Cheng;Hodi, F Stephen;Dranoff, Glenn;Wucherpfennig, Kai W"

Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the bloodstream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded blood vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct. These results suggest that the lymph node blood vessels can serve as an exit route for systemic dissemination of cancer cells in experimental mouse models. Whether this form of tumor cell spreading occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.","Brown, M;Assen, F P;Leithner, A;Abe, J;Schachner, H;Asfour, G;Bago-Horvath, Z;Stein, J V;Uhrin, P;Sixt, M;Kerjaschki, D"

This can be achieved by antibodies blocking the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway, either alone or in combination. The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse.

We find that perturbation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in humans elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detected by peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2). In the oligomeric state, PRDX2 forms a replisome-associated ROS sensor, which binds the fork accelerator TIMELESS when exposed to low levels of ROS. Elevated ROS levels generated by RNR attenuation disrupt oligomerized PRDX2 to smaller subunits, whose dissociation from chromatin enforces the displacement of TIMELESS from the replisome. This process instantly slows replication fork progression, which mitigates pathological consequences of replication stress. Thus, redox signaling couples fluctuations of dNTP biogenesis with replisome activity to reduce stress during genome duplication.

Its mechanism of action and the basis for its selectivity have so far been unknown. Here we show that indisulam promotes the recruitment of RBM39 (RNA binding motif protein 39) to the CUL4-DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to RBM39 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mutations in RBM39 that prevent its recruitment to CUL4-DCAF15 increase RBM39 stability and confer resistance to indisulam's cytotoxicity. RBM39 associates with precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing factors, and inactivation of RBM39 by indisulam causes aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. Many cancer cell lines derived from hematopoietic and lymphoid lineages are sensitive to indisulam, and their sensitivity correlates with DCAF15 expression levels. Two other clinically tested sulfonamides, tasisulam and chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide, share the same mechanism of action as indisulam. We propose that DCAF15 expression may be a useful biomarker to guide clinical trials of this class of drugs, which we refer to as SPLAMs (splicing inhibitor sulfonamides).","Han, Ting;Goralski, Maria;Gaskill, Nicholas;Capota, Emanuela;Kim, Jiwoong;Ting, Tabitha C;Xie, Yang;Williams, Noelle S;Nijhawan, Deepak"

This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor SOX2, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting SOX2 expression.

Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients.

Suppression of MYC in mouse tumors and human tumor cells caused a reduction in the levels of CD47 and PD-L1 messenger RNA and protein. MYC was found to bind directly to the promoters of the Cd47 and Pd-l1 genes. MYC inactivation in mouse tumors down-regulated CD47 and PD-L1 expression and enhanced the antitumor immune response. In contrast, when MYC was inactivated in tumors with enforced expression of CD47 or PD-L1, the immune response was suppressed, and tumors continued to grow.

We report that increases in intracellular levels of the second messenger, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and the subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) induce a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in mesenchymal human mammary epithelial cells. PKA activation triggers epigenetic reprogramming of TICs by the histone demethylase PHF2, which promotes their differentiation and loss of tumor-initiating ability.

By interrogating data from a large-scale short hairpin RNA-mediated screen across 390 cancer cell line models, we found that the viability of MTAP-deficient cancer cells is impaired by depletion of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. MTAP-deleted cells accumulate the metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA), which we found to inhibit PRMT5 methyltransferase activity. Deletion of MTAP in MTAP-proficient cells rendered them sensitive to PRMT5 depletion. Conversely, reconstitution of MTAP in an MTAP-deficient cell line rescued PRMT5 dependence. Thus, MTA accumulation in MTAP-deleted cancers creates a hypomorphic PRMT5 state that is selectively sensitized toward further PRMT5 inhibition.

Consequently, drugs targeting the inactive or guanosine 5'-diphosphate-bound conformation are not expected to be effective. We describe a mechanism that enables such drugs to inhibit KRAS(G12C) signaling and cancer cell growth. Inhibition requires intact GTPase activity and occurs because drug-bound KRAS(G12C) is insusceptible to nucleotide exchange factors and thus trapped in its inactive state. Indeed, mutants completely lacking GTPase activity and those promoting exchange reduced the potency of the drug. Suppressing nucleotide exchange activity downstream of various tyrosine kinases enhanced KRAS(G12C) inhibition, whereas its potentiation had the opposite effect. These findings reveal that KRAS(G12C) undergoes nucleotide cycling in cancer cells and provide a basis for developing effective therapies to treat KRAS(G12C)-driven cancers.

This could in principle explain how Ub-Fancd2 promotes ICL repair, but we show that recruitment of Fan1 by Ub-Fancd2 is dispensable for ICL repair. Instead, Fan1 recruitment--and activity--restrains DNA replication fork progression and prevents chromosome abnormalities from occurring when DNA replication forks stall, even in the absence of ICLs. Accordingly, Fan1 nuclease-defective knockin mice are cancer-prone. Moreover, we show that a Fan1 variant in high-risk pancreatic cancers abolishes recruitment by Ub-Fancd2 and causes genetic instability without affecting ICL repair.

This effect is due to increased uptake of the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Increased DHA uptake causes oxidative stress as intracellular DHA is reduced to vitamin C, depleting glutathione.

Biopsy of bone metastases is challenging; hence, sampling circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may reveal drug-resistance mechanisms. We established single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiles of 77 intact CTCs isolated from 13 patients (mean six CTCs per patient), by using microfluidic enrichment. Single CTCs from each individual display considerable heterogeneity, including expression of AR gene mutations and splicing variants. Retrospective analysis of CTCs from patients progressing under treatment with an AR inhibitor, compared with untreated cases, indicates activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling (P = 0.0064). Ectopic expression of Wnt5a in prostate cancer cells attenuates the antiproliferative effect of AR inhibition, whereas its suppression in drug-resistant cells restores partial sensitivity, a correlation also evident in an established mouse model. Thus, single-cell analysis of prostate CTCs reveals heterogeneity in signaling pathways that could contribute to treatment failure.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CIN still remain elusive. We found that a number of CIN(+) cell lines have impairments in the integrity of the conserved inner centromere-shugoshin (ICS) network, which coordinates sister chromatid cohesion and kinetochore-microtubule attachment. These defects are caused mostly by the loss of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at centromeres and sometimes by a reduction in chromatin-associated cohesin; both pathways separately sustain centromeric shugoshin stability. Artificial restoration of the ICS network suppresses chromosome segregation errors in a wide range of CIN(+) cells, including RB- and BRCA1-deficient cells. Thus, dysfunction of the ICS network might be a key mechanism underlying CIN in human tumorigenesis.

RAB35 functions downstream of growth factor receptors and upstream of PDK1 and mTORC2 and copurifies with PI3K in immunoprecipitation assays. Two somatic RAB35 mutations found in human tumors generate alleles that constitutively activate PI3K/AKT signaling, suppress apoptosis, and transform cells in a PI3K-dependent manner.

Multiple cancer types, including up to 83% of glioblastomas (GBMs), harbor highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations of unknown function but specific to two nucleotide positions. We identified the functional consequence of these mutations in GBMs to be recruitment of the multimeric GA-binding protein (GABP) transcription factor specifically to the mutant promoter. Allelic recruitment of GABP is consistently observed across four cancer types, highlighting a shared mechanism underlying TERT reactivation.

These ""dark CPDs"" constitute the majority of CPDs and include the cytosine-containing CPDs that initiate UV-signature C→T mutations. Dark CPDs arise when UV-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species combine to excite an electron in fragments of the pigment melanin. This creates a quantum triplet state that has the energy of a UV photon but induces CPDs by energy transfer to DNA in a radiation-independent manner. Melanin may thus be carcinogenic as well as protective against cancer.

In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself.

There was pronounced intratumor heterogeneity in copy number alterations, translocations, and mutations associated with APOBEC cytidine deaminase activity. Despite maintained carcinogen exposure, tumors from smokers showed a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-associated mutations.

Here, we analyzed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by prostate cancer-associated mutations of SPOP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding protein. SPOP mutants impaired ubiquitylation of a subset of proteins in a dominant-negative fashion. Of these, DEK and TRIM24 emerged as effector substrates consistently up-regulated by SPOP mutants. We highlight DEK as a SPOP substrate that exhibited decreases in ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation resulting from heteromeric complexes of wild-type and mutant SPOP protein. DEK stabilization promoted prostate epithelial cell invasion, which implicated DEK as an oncogenic effector. More generally, these results provide a framework to decipher tumorigenic mechanisms linked to dysregulated ubiquitylation.

L1 elements propagate through RNA intermediates. In the germ line, neighboring, nonrepetitive sequences are occasionally mobilized by the L1 machinery, a process called 3' transduction. Because 3' transductions are potentially mutagenic, we explored the extent to which they occur somatically during tumorigenesis. Studying cancer genomes from 244 patients, we found that tumors from 53% of the patients had somatic retrotranspositions, of which 24% were 3' transductions. Fingerprinting of donor L1s revealed that a handful of source L1 elements in a tumor can spawn from tens to hundreds of 3' transductions, which can themselves seed further retrotranspositions. The activity of individual L1 elements fluctuated during tumor evolution and correlated with L1 promoter hypomethylation. The 3' transductions disseminated genes, exons, and regulatory elements to new locations, most often to heterochromatic regions of the genome.

There, these bacteria stimulate the generation of a specific subset of ""pathogenic"" T helper 17 (pT(H)17) cells and memory T(H)1 immune responses. Tumor-bearing mice that were germ-free or that had been treated with antibiotics to kill Gram-positive bacteria showed a reduction in pT(H)17 responses, and their tumors were resistant to cyclophosphamide. Adoptive transfer of pT(H)17 cells partially restored the antitumor efficacy of cyclophosphamide.

In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after CpG-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapy require an intact commensal microbiota that mediates its effects by modulating myeloid-derived cell functions in the tumor microenvironment.

To become motile and invasive, embryonic epithelial cells undergo a process of mesenchymal conversion known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Likewise, EMT can be seen in cancer cells as they leave the primary tumor and disseminate to other parts of the body to colonize distant organs and form metastases. In addition, through the reverse process (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition), both normal and carcinoma cells revert to the epithelial phenotype to, respectively, differentiate into organs or form secondary tumors. The parallels in phenotypic plasticity in normal morphogenesis and cancer highlight the importance of studying the embryo to understand tumor progression and to aid in the design of improved therapeutic strategies.

Mouse cells disrupted for the RTEL1-PCNA interaction (PIP mutant) exhibited accelerated senescence, replication fork instability, reduced replication fork extension rates, and increased origin usage. Although T-loop disassembly at telomeres was unaffected in the mutant cells, telomere replication was compromised, leading to fragile sites at telomeres. RTEL1-PIP mutant mice were viable, but loss of the RTEL1-PCNA interaction accelerated the onset of tumorigenesis in p53-deficient mice.

Although progress has been made in identifying positive regulators of the Rags, it is unknown if negative factors also exist. Here, we identify GATOR as a complex that interacts with the Rags and is composed of two subcomplexes we call GATOR1 and -2. Inhibition of GATOR1 subunits (DEPDC5, Nprl2, and Nprl3) makes mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. In contrast, inhibition of GATOR2 subunits (Mios, WDR24, WDR59, Seh1L, and Sec13) suppresses mTORC1 signaling, and epistasis analysis shows that GATOR2 negatively regulates DEPDC5. GATOR1 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for RagA and RagB, and its components are mutated in human cancer. In cancer cells with inactivating mutations in GATOR1, mTORC1 is hyperactive and insensitive to amino acid starvation, and such cells are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Thus, we identify a key negative regulator of the Rag GTPases and reveal that, like other mTORC1 regulators, Rag function can be deregulated in cancer.","Bar-Peled, Liron;Chantranupong, Lynne;Cherniack, Andrew D;Chen, Walter W;Ottina, Kathleen A;Grabiner, Brian C;Spear, Eric D;Carter, Scott L;Meyerson, Matthew;Sabatini, David M"

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), silences gene expression via its histone methyltransferase activity. We found that the oncogenic function of EZH2 in cells of castration-resistant prostate cancer is independent of its role as a transcriptional repressor. Instead, it involves the ability of EZH2 to act as a coactivator for critical transcription factors including the androgen receptor. This functional switch is dependent on phosphorylation of EZH2 and requires an intact methyltransferase domain. Hence, targeting the non-PRC2 function of EZH2 may have therapeutic efficacy for treating metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer.","Xu, Kexin;Wu, Zhenhua Jeremy;Groner, Anna C;He, Housheng Hansen;Cai, Changmeng;Lis, Rosina T;Wu, Xiaoqiu;Stack, Edward C;Loda, Massimo;Liu, Tao;Xu, Han;Cato, Laura;Thornton, James E;Gregory, Richard I;Morrissey, Colm;Vessella, Robert L;Montironi, Rodolfo;Magi-Galluzzi, Cristina;Kantoff, Philip W;Balk, Steven P;Liu, X Shirley;Brown, Myles"

However, it remains unknown whether cells within single genetic clones are functionally equivalent. By combining DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling, sequencing, and lentiviral lineage tracking, we followed the repopulation dynamics of 150 single lentivirus-marked lineages from 10 human colorectal cancers through serial xenograft passages in mice. CNA and mutational analysis distinguished individual clones and showed that clones remained stable upon serial transplantation. Despite this stability, the proliferation, persistence, and chemotherapy tolerance of lentivirally marked lineages were variable within each clone. Chemotherapy promoted the dominance of previously minor or dormant lineages. Thus, apart from genetic diversity, tumor cells display inherent functional variability in tumor propagation potential, which contributes to both cancer growth and therapy tolerance.","Kreso, Antonija;O'Brien, Catherine A;van Galen, Peter;Gan, Olga I;Notta, Faiyaz;Brown, Andrew M K;Ng, Karen;Ma, Jing;Wienholds, Erno;Dunant, Cyrille;Pollett, Aaron;Gallinger, Steven;McPherson, John;Mullighan, Charles G;Shibata, Darryl;Dick, John E"

These SNPs may affect cancer development through altered regulation of MYC expression, but this hypothesis has been difficult to confirm. We generated mice deficient in Myc-335, a putative MYC regulatory element that contains rs6983267, a SNP accounting for more human cancer-related morbidity than any other genetic variant or mutation. In Myc-335 null mice, Myc transcripts were expressed in the intestinal crypts in a pattern similar to that in wild-type mice but at modestly reduced levels.

Expression of a Beclin 1 mutant resistant to Akt-mediated phosphorylation increased autophagy, reduced anchorage-independent growth, and inhibited Akt-driven tumorigenesis. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 enhanced its interactions with 14-3-3 and vimentin intermediate filament proteins, and vimentin depletion increased autophagy and inhibited Akt-driven transformation. Thus, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 functions in autophagy inhibition, oncogenesis, and the formation of an autophagy-inhibitory Beclin 1/14-3-3/vimentin intermediate filament complex. These findings have broad implications for understanding the role of Akt signaling and intermediate filament proteins in autophagy and cancer.","Wang, Richard C;Wei, Yongjie;An, Zhenyi;Zou, Zhongju;Xiao, Guanghua;Bhagat, Govind;White, Michael;Reichelt, Julia;Levine, Beth"

Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype.

Upon glucose starvation, cellular SAICAR concentration increased in an oscillatory manner and stimulated PKM2 activity in cancer cells. Changes in SAICAR amounts in cancer cells altered cellular energy level, glucose uptake, and lactate production. The SAICAR-PKM2 interaction also promoted cancer cell survival in glucose-limited conditions. SAICAR accumulation was not observed in normal adult epithelial cells or lung fibroblasts, regardless of glucose conditions.

Hyperploid, calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content. In contrast, hyperploid cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure.

Patients with highly primed cancers exhibited superior clinical response to chemotherapy. In contrast, chemoresistant cancers and normal tissues were poorly primed.

21960636,2011.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Chromosome segregation errors as a cause of DNA damage and structural chromosome aberrations.,"Various types of chromosomal aberrations, including numerical (aneuploidy) and structural (e.g., translocations, deletions), are commonly found in human tumors and are linked to tumorigenesis. Aneuploidy is a direct consequence of chromosome segregation errors in mitosis, whereas structural aberrations are caused by improperly repaired DNA breaks. Here, we demonstrate that chromosome segregation errors can also result in structural chromosome aberrations. Chromosomes that missegregate are frequently damaged during cytokinesis, triggering a DNA double-strand break response in the respective daughter cells involving ATM, Chk2, and p53. We show that these double-strand breaks can lead to unbalanced translocations in the daughter cells. Our data show that segregation errors can cause translocations and provide insights into the role of whole-chromosome instability in tumorigenesis.","Janssen, Aniek;van der Burg, Marja;Szuhai, Karoly;Kops, Geert J P L;Medema, René H"

A diverse range of tumor types were found to harbor deletions or inactivating mutations of STAG2, a gene encoding a subunit of the cohesin complex, which regulates the separation of sister chromatids during cell division. Because STAG2 is on the X chromosome, its inactivation requires only a single mutational event. Studying a near-diploid human cell line with a stable karyotype, we found that targeted inactivation of STAG2 led to chromatid cohesion defects and aneuploidy, whereas in two aneuploid human glioblastoma cell lines, targeted correction of the endogenous mutant alleles of STAG2 led to enhanced chromosomal stability. Thus, genetic disruption of cohesin is a cause of aneuploidy in human cancer.","Solomon, David A;Kim, Taeyeon;Diaz-Martinez, Laura A;Fair, Joshlean;Elkahloun, Abdel G;Harris, Brent T;Toretsky, Jeffrey A;Rosenberg, Steven A;Shukla, Neerav;Ladanyi, Marc;Samuels, Yardena;James, C David;Yu, Hongtao;Kim, Jung-Sik;Waldman, Todd"

Although agonistic CD40 antibodies have been developed for immunotherapy, their clinical efficacy has been limited. We have found that coengagement of the Fc domain of agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the inhibitory Fcγ receptor FcγRIIB is required for immune activation. Direct comparison of mAbs to CD40 enhanced for activating FcγR binding, hence capable of cytotoxicity, or for inhibitory FcγRIIB binding, revealed that enhancing FcγRIIB binding conferred immunostimulatory activity and considerably greater anti-tumor responses. This unexpected requirement for FcγRIIB in enhancing CD40-mediated immune activation has direct implications for the design of agonistic antibodies to TNFR as therapeutics.","Li, Fubin;Ravetch, Jeffrey V"

Treated samples showed distinct, structure-specific near-infrared fluorescence at wavelengths 10 to 15% longer than displayed by pristine semiconducting SWCNTs. Dopant sites harvest light energy absorbed in undoped nanotube regions by trapping mobile excitons. The oxygen-doped SWCNTs are much easier to detect and image than pristine SWCNTs because they give stronger near-infrared emission and do not absorb at the shifted emission wavelength.","Ghosh, Saunab;Bachilo, Sergei M;Simonette, Rebecca A;Beckingham, Kathleen M;Weisman, R Bruce"

A stromal cell type that was first identified in human cancers expresses fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP). We created a transgenic mouse in which FAP-expressing cells can be ablated. Depletion of FAP-expressing cells, which made up only 2% of all tumor cells in established Lewis lung carcinomas, caused rapid hypoxic necrosis of both cancer and stromal cells in immunogenic tumors by a process involving interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Depleting FAP-expressing cells in a subcutaneous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma also permitted immunological control of growth. Therefore, FAP-expressing cells are a nonredundant, immune-suppressive component of the tumor microenvironment.","Kraman, Matthew;Bambrough, Paul J;Arnold, James N;Roberts, Edward W;Magiera, Lukasz;Jones, James O;Gopinathan, Aarthi;Tuveson, David A;Fearon, Douglas T"

20847263,2010.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Evidence for an alternative glycolytic pathway in rapidly proliferating cells.,"Proliferating cells, including cancer cells, require altered metabolism to efficiently incorporate nutrients such as glucose into biomass. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes the metabolism of glucose by aerobic glycolysis and contributes to anabolic metabolism. Paradoxically, decreased pyruvate kinase enzyme activity accompanies the expression of PKM2 in rapidly dividing cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrate for pyruvate kinase in cells, can act as a phosphate donor in mammalian cells because PEP participates in the phosphorylation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1) in PKM2-expressing cells. We used mass spectrometry to show that the phosphate from PEP is transferred to the catalytic histidine (His11) on human PGAM1. This reaction occurred at physiological concentrations of PEP and produced pyruvate in the absence of PKM2 activity. The presence of histidine-phosphorylated PGAM1 correlated with the expression of PKM2 in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Thus, decreased pyruvate kinase activity in PKM2-expressing cells allows PEP-dependent histidine phosphorylation of PGAM1 and may provide an alternate glycolytic pathway that decouples adenosine triphosphate production from PEP-mediated phosphotransfer, allowing for the high rate of glycolysis to support the anabolic metabolism observed in many proliferating cells.","Vander Heiden, Matthew G;Locasale, Jason W;Swanson, Kenneth D;Sharfi, Hadar;Heffron, Greg J;Amador-Noguez, Daniel;Christofk, Heather R;Wagner, Gerhard;Rabinowitz, Joshua D;Asara, John M;Cantley, Lewis C"

To explore the genetic origin of OCCC, we determined the exomic sequences of eight tumors after immunoaffinity purification of cancer cells. Through comparative analyses of normal cells from the same patients, we identified four genes that were mutated in at least two tumors. PIK3CA, which encodes a subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and KRAS, which encodes a well-known oncoprotein, had previously been implicated in OCCC. The other two mutated genes were previously unknown to be involved in OCCC: PPP2R1A encodes a regulatory subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 2, and ARID1A encodes adenine-thymine (AT)-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A, which participates in chromatin remodeling. The nature and pattern of the mutations suggest that PPP2R1A functions as an oncogene and ARID1A as a tumor-suppressor gene. In a total of 42 OCCCs, 7% had mutations in PPP2R1A and 57% had mutations in ARID1A.

The cooperative effects of AKT, ERG, and androgen receptor in basal cells recapitulated the histological and molecular features of human prostate cancer, with loss of basal cells and expansion of luminal cells expressing prostate-specific antigen and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.

Systemic injection with iRGD improved the therapeutic index of drugs of various compositions, including a small molecule (doxorubicin), nanoparticles (nab-paclitaxel and doxorubicin liposomes), and a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab).

We studied LSCs in mouse models of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) induced either by coexpression of the Hoxa9 and Meis1a oncogenes or by the fusion oncoprotein MLL-AF9. We show that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is required for self-renewal of LSCs that are derived from either hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or more differentiated granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). Because the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is normally active in HSCs but not in GMP, these results suggest that reactivation of beta-catenin signaling is required for the transformation of progenitor cells by certain oncogenes. beta-catenin is not absolutely required for self-renewal of adult HSCs; thus, targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway may represent a new therapeutic opportunity in AML.","Wang, Yingzi;Krivtsov, Andrei V;Sinha, Amit U;North, Trista E;Goessling, Wolfram;Feng, Zhaohui;Zon, Leonard I;Armstrong, Scott A"

Many cancers secrete CCL21, a chemoattractant for various leukocytes and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, which drive lymphoid neogenesis. CCL21 expression by melanoma tumors in mice was associated with an immunotolerant microenvironment, which included the induction of lymphoid-like reticular stromal networks, an altered cytokine milieu, and the recruitment of regulatory leukocyte populations. In contrast, CCL21-deficient tumors induced antigen-specific immunity. CCL21-mediated immune tolerance was dependent on host rather than tumor expression of the CCL21 receptor, CCR7, and could protect distant, coimplanted CCL21-deficient tumors and even nonsyngeneic allografts from rejection. We suggest that by altering the tumor microenvironment, CCL21-secreting tumors shift the host immune response from immunogenic to tolerogenic, which facilitates tumor progression.","Shields, Jacqueline D;Kourtis, Iraklis C;Tomei, Alice A;Roberts, Joanna M;Swartz, Melody A"

Receptor-ligand binding, clustering, and subsequent lateral transport within this junction were observed. EphA2 transport can be blocked by physical barriers nanofabricated onto the underlying substrate. This physical reorganization of EphA2 alters the cellular response to ephrin-A1, as observed by changes in cytoskeleton morphology and recruitment of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10.

To investigate the cellular origin of LMO2-induced leukemia, we used cell fate mapping to study mice in which the Lmo2 gene was constitutively expressed in the thymus. Lmo2 induced self-renewal of committed T cells in the mice more than 8 months before the development of overt T-ALL. These self-renewing cells retained the capacity for T cell differentiation but expressed several genes typical of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that Lmo2 might reactivate an HSC-specific transcriptional program. Forced expression of one such gene, Hhex, was sufficient to initiate self-renewal of thymocytes in vivo. Thus, Lmo2 promotes the self-renewal of preleukemic thymocytes, providing a mechanism by which committed T cells can then accumulate additional genetic mutations required for leukemic transformation.","McCormack, Matthew P;Young, Lauren F;Vasudevan, Sumitha;de Graaf, Carolyn A;Codrington, Rosalind;Rabbitts, Terence H;Jane, Stephen M;Curtis, David J"

By studying human prostate cancer cells with fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that androgen signaling induces proximity of the TMPRSS2 and ERG genomic loci, both located on chromosome 21q22.2. Subsequent exposure of the cells to gamma irradiation, which causes DNA double-strand breaks, facilitates the formation of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

P-REX2a mRNA was more abundant in human cancer cells and significantly increased in tumors with wild-type PTEN that expressed an activated mutant of PIK3CA encoding the p110 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase subunit alpha (PI3Kalpha). P-REX2a inhibited PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and stimulated the PI3K pathway only in the presence of PTEN. P-REX2a stimulated cell growth and cooperated with a PIK3CA mutant to promote growth factor-independent proliferation and transformation. Depletion of P-REX2a reduced amounts of phosphorylated AKT and growth in human cell lines with intact PTEN.

To evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to GDC-0449, we determined the mutational status of Hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. We identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of SMO that had no effect on Hh signaling but disrupted the ability of GDC-0449 to bind SMO and suppress this pathway.

The mutant cells exhibited enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis and survived in low-glucose conditions, phenotypes that all required GLUT1 expression. In contrast, when cells with wild-type KRAS alleles were subjected to a low-glucose environment, very few cells survived. Most surviving cells expressed high levels of GLUT1, and 4% of these survivors had acquired KRAS mutations not present in their parents.

Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production.

Forced expression of mutant IDH1 in cultured cells reduces formation of the enzyme product, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), and increases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor subunit HIF-1alpha, a transcription factor that facilitates tumor growth when oxygen is low and whose stability is regulated by alpha-KG. The rise in HIF-1alpha levels was reversible by an alpha-KG derivative. HIF-1alpha levels were higher in human gliomas harboring an IDH1 mutation than in tumors without a mutation.

To help distinguish between these two classes of alterations, we used a transposon-based genetic screen in mice to identify candidate genes for CRC. Mice harboring mutagenic Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons were crossed with mice expressing SB transposase in gastrointestinal tract epithelium. Most of the offspring developed intestinal lesions, including intraepithelial neoplasia, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas. Analysis of over 16,000 transposon insertions identified 77 candidate CRC genes, 60 of which are mutated and/or dysregulated in human CRC and thus are most likely to drive tumorigenesis.

Applying dynamic in vivo imaging to a mouse model, we show that leukemic cell growth disrupts normal hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) bone marrow niches and creates abnormal microenvironments that sequester transplanted human CD34+ (HPC-enriched) cells. CD34+ cells in leukemic mice declined in number over time and failed to mobilize into the peripheral circulation in response to cytokine stimulation. Neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells inhibited CD34+ cell migration into malignant niches, normalized CD34+ cell numbers, and restored CD34+ cell mobilization in leukemic mice. These data suggest that the tumor microenvironment causes HPC dysfunction by usurping normal HPC niches and that therapeutic inhibition of HPC interaction with tumor niches may help maintain normal progenitor cell function in the setting of malignancy.","Colmone, Angela;Amorim, Maria;Pontier, Andrea L;Wang, Sheng;Jablonski, Elizabeth;Sipkins, Dorothy A"

The diagnosis and relapse samples typically showed different patterns of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), with the CNAs acquired at relapse preferentially affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and B cell development. Most relapse samples lacked some of the CNAs present at diagnosis, which suggests that the cells responsible for relapse are ancestral to the primary leukemia cells. Backtracking studies revealed that cells corresponding to the relapse clone were often present as minor subpopulations at diagnosis.

Analysis of human prostate tumors revealed that miR-101 expression decreases during cancer progression, paralleling an increase in EZH2 expression. One or both of the two genomic loci encoding miR-101 were somatically lost in 37.5% of clinically localized prostate cancer cells (6 of 16) and 66.7% of metastatic disease cells (22 of 33).

Human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion or mutation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), which also activates mTOR.

Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes.

ASE results in reduced expression of the gene, is dominantly inherited, segregates in families, and occurs in sporadic CRC cases. Although subtle, the reduction in constitutive TGFBR1 expression alters SMAD-mediated TGF-beta signaling.

In the presence of a chemokine gradient, this Wnt-mediated receptor-actin-myosin polarity (W-RAMP) structure accumulates asymmetrically at the cell periphery, where it triggers membrane contractility and nuclear movement in the direction of membrane retraction. The process requires endosome trafficking, is associated with multivesicular bodies, and is regulated by Wnt5a through the small guanosine triphosphatases Rab4 and RhoB.

Using assays of metastasis in mice, we found that the recipient tumor cells acquired the metastatic potential of the transferred mtDNA. The mtDNA conferring high metastatic potential contained G13997A and 13885insC mutations in the gene encoding NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6). These mutations produced a deficiency in respiratory complex I activity and were associated with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

One might have, therefore, anticipated that a sizable number of DNA DSBs would be incompatible with cell proliferation. Yet recent experimental findings suggest that, in both precancerous lesions and cancers, activated oncogenes induce stalling and collapse of DNA replication forks, which in turn leads to formation of DNA DSBs. This continuous formation of DNA DSBs may contribute to the genomic instability that characterizes the vast majority of human cancers. In addition, in precancerous lesions, these DNA DSBs activate p53, which, by inducing apoptosis or senescence, raises a barrier to tumor progression. Breach of this barrier by various mechanisms, most notably by p53 mutations, that impair the DNA damage response pathway allows cancers to develop. Thus, oncogene-induced DNA damage may explain two key features of cancer: genomic instability and the high frequency of p53 mutations.","Halazonetis, Thanos D;Gorgoulis, Vassilis G;Bartek, Jiri"

Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network.

Furthermore, ablation of IL-6 abolished the gender differences in hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. DEN exposure promoted production of IL-6 in Kupffer cells (KCs) in a manner dependent on the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88, ablation of which also protected male mice from DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Estrogen inhibited secretion of IL-6 from KCs exposed to necrotic hepatocytes and reduced circulating concentrations of IL-6 in DEN-treated male mice.

These proteins have disparate roles in regulating the biology of embryonic stem cells and tumor suppression, and they help define the selection of cell fate and the progression of differentiation along a lineage. Here we illustrate their roles in embryonic stem cells and in the differentiation of neural, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and gastrointestinal epithelial stem cells.","Mishra, Lopa;Derynck, Rik;Mishra, Bibhuti"

To study the role of collagen VII in these cancers, we examined Ras-driven tumorigenesis in RDEB keratinocytes. Cells devoid of collagen VII did not form tumors in mice, whereas those retaining a specific collagen VII fragment (the amino-terminal noncollagenous domain NC1) were tumorigenic. Forced NC1 expression restored tumorigenicity to collagen VII-null epidermis in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Fibronectin-like sequences within NC1 (FNC1) promoted tumor cell invasion in a laminin 5-dependent manner and were required for tumorigenesis. Tumor-stroma interactions mediated by collagen VII thus promote neoplasia, and retention of NC1 sequences in a subset of RDEB patients may contribute to their increased susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma.","Ortiz-Urda, Susana;Garcia, John;Green, Cheryl L;Chen, Lei;Lin, Qun;Veitch, Dallas P;Sakai, Lynn Y;Lee, Hyangkyu;Marinkovich, M Peter;Khavari, Paul A"

Here, I review emerging evidence supporting an alternative hypothesis-that certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently ""normalize"" the abnormal structure and function of tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery. Drugs that induce vascular normalization can alleviate hypoxia and increase the efficacy of conventional therapies if both are carefully scheduled. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization may ultimately lead to more effective therapies not only for cancer but also for diseases with abnormal vasculature, as well as regenerative medicine, in which the goal is to create and maintain a functionally normal vasculature.","Jain, Rakesh K"

Protein interaction between BCL-2 members is a prominent mechanism of control and is mediated through the amphipathic alpha-helical BH3 segment, an essential death domain. We used a chemical strategy, termed hydrocarbon stapling, to generate BH3 peptides with improved pharmacologic properties. The stapled peptides, called ""stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains"" (SAHBs), proved to be helical, protease-resistant, and cell-permeable molecules that bound with increased affinity to multidomain BCL-2 member pockets. A SAHB of the BH3 domain from the BID protein specifically activated the apoptotic pathway to kill leukemia cells. In addition, SAHB effectively inhibited the growth of human leukemia xenografts in vivo.

This study shows that AML1-ETO, as well as ETO, inhibits transcriptional activation by E proteins through stable interactions that preclude recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivators. These interactions are mediated by a conserved ETO TAF4 homology domain and a 17-amino acid p300/CBP and ETO target motif within AD1 activation domains of E proteins. In t(8;21) leukemic cells, very stable interactions between AML1-ETO and E proteins underlie a t(8;21) translocation-specific silencing of E protein function through an aberrant cofactor exchange mechanism.

NSCLC cells expressing mutant EGFRs underwent extensive apoptosis after small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the mutant EGFR or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt and STAT signaling and were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, mutant EGFRs selectively transduce survival signals on which NSCLCs become dependent; inhibition of those signals by gefitinib may contribute to the drug's efficacy.","Sordella, Raffaella;Bell, Daphne W;Haber, Daniel A;Settleman, Jeffrey"

MNCs and CD34+/c-kit+ cells were co-cultured with mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under a two-step expansion. The expanded cells were then transplanted into sublethally irradiated BDF1 mice. Results showed that the co-culture with MSCs resulted in expansions of median total nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, GM-CFC and HPP-CFC respectively by 10.8-, 4.8-, 65.9- and 38.8-fold for the mononuclear cell culture, and respectively by 76.1-, 2.9-, 71.7- and 51.8-fold for the CD34+/c-kit+ cell culture. The expanded cells could rapidly engraft in the sublethally irradiated mice and reconstitute their hematopoiesis. Co-cultures with MSCs in conjunction with two-step expansion increased expansions of total nucleated cells, GM-CFC and HPP-CFC, which led us to conclude MSCs may create favorable environment for expansions of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

The expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, CD44v6, HER2/neu and p53 was found in cancer cells in 87.01%, 85.71%, 68.18%, 98.05%, 55.19% and 50.65% cases respectively. Linear regression and correlation analysis revealed that there was close positive relationship (P<0.05) between the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, TIMP-1 and CD44v6, HER2/neu and MMP-9, MMP-2 and p53. Up-regulation of MMP-2 was accompanied by advanced T stage (P<0.01). There was also a trend of MMP-2 expression being related with tumor metastasis. Increased expression of HER2/neu was found in patients with tumor recurrence(P<0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 was higher in laryngeal cancer than that in pharyngeal cancer, and higher in keratinizing and non-keratinizing SCC than that in basaloid SCC(P<0.05). These findings suggested that MMP-2 and MMP-9, HER2/neu and MMP-9, MMP-2 and p53 had a coordinate function in aggression of tumor; that MMP-2 had a more important function than MMP-9 in tumor invasion and metastasis; and that HER2/neu might serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis in HNSCC.","Xu, Ya-Ping;Zhao, Xue-Qun;Sommer, K;Moubayed, P"

MCA/129 fibrosarcomas and B16F1 melanomas grown in apoptosis-resistant acid sphingomyelinase (asmase)-deficient or Bax-deficient mice displayed markedly reduced baseline microvascular endothelial apoptosis and grew 200 to 400% faster than tumors on wild-type microvasculature. Thus, endothelial apoptosis is a homeostatic factor regulating angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth. Moreover, these tumors exhibited reduced endothelial apoptosis upon irradiation and, unlike tumors in wild-type mice, they were resistant to single-dose radiation up to 20 grays (Gy).

Science,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression is related to angiogenesis, bcl-2 and cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma.","In this study, we examined the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemical staining in 76 tissue sections collected from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hepatectomy. Microvascular density (MVD) was determined by counting endothelial cells immunostained using anti-CD34 antibody. We performed DNA-flow cytometric analyses to elucidate the impact of iNOS and VEGF expression on the cell cycle of HCC. Most of the HCC cells that invaded stroma were markedly immunostained by iNOS antibody. The iNOS stain intensity of the liver tissue close to the tumor edge was stronger than that of HCC tissue, and the strongest was the hepatocytes closer to the tumor tissue. However, iNOS expression in 10 normal hepatic samples was undetectable. VEGF positive expression ratio was 84.8% in iNOS positive expression cases, and the ratio was 35.3% in negative cases. There was significant correlation (P = 0.000) between iNOS and VEGF expression. Moreover, iNOS expression was significantly associated with bcl-2 and MVD, but without p53 expression. DNA-flow cytometric analyses showed that combined expression of iNOS and VEGF had significant impact on the cell cycle in HCC. PI (Proliferating Index) and SPF (S-phase fraction) in the combined positive expression of iNOS and VEGF group was significantly higher than that in the combined negative group. The present findings suggested that iNOS expression was significantly associated with angiogenesis, bcl-2 and cell proliferation of HCC.","Peng, Jia-Ping;Zheng, Shu;Xiao, Zuo-Xiang;Zhang, Su-Zhan"

We used a conditional transgenic mouse model for MYC-induced tumorigenesis to demonstrate that brief inactivation of MYC results in the sustained regression of tumors and the differentiation of osteogenic sarcoma cells into mature osteocytes. Subsequent reactivation of MYC did not restore the cells' malignant properties but instead induced apoptosis. Thus, brief MYC inactivation appears to cause epigenetic changes in tumor cells that render them insensitive to MYC-induced tumorigenesis.

Through use of a conditional (cre/lox) allele, we show that loss of NF1 in the Schwann cell lineage is sufficient to generate tumors. In addition, complete NF1-mediated tumorigenicity requires both a loss of NF1 in cells destined to become neoplastic as well as heterozygosity in non-neoplastic cells.

These Ras-responsive transcription factors are required for transformation, but the mechanisms by which these proteins facilitate oncogenesis have not been fully established. Oncogenic Ras was shown to initiate a p53-independent apoptotic response that was suppressed through the activation of NF-kappaB. These results provide an explanation for the requirement of NF-kappaB for Ras-mediated oncogenesis and provide evidence that Ras-transformed cells are susceptible to apoptosis even if they do not express the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product.","Mayo, M W;Wang, C Y;Cogswell, P C;Rogers-Graham, K S;Lowe, S W;Der, C J;Baldwin, A S"

This is illustrated by molecular epidemiologic studies of environmental carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines. Individual genetic screening for rare high-risk traits or for more common, low-penetrant susceptibility genes is problematic and not routinely recommended. However, knowledge of the full spectrum of both genetic and acquired susceptibility in the population will be instrumental in developing health and regulatory policies that increase protection of the more susceptible groups from risks of environmental carcinogens. This will necessitate revision of current risk assessment methodologies to explicitly account for individual variation in susceptibility to environmental carcinogens.","Perera, F P"

Intravenous administration of the antibody-tTF complex to mice with large neuroblastomas resulted in complete tumor regressions in 38 percent of the mice.","Huang, X;Molema, G;King, S;Watkins, L;Edgington, T S;Thorpe, P E"

Resveratrol was found to act as an antioxidant and antimutagen and to induce phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (anti-initiation activity); it mediated anti-inflammatory effects and inhibited cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase functions (antipromotion activity); and it induced human promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation (antiprogression activity). In addition, it inhibited the development of preneoplastic lesions in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in culture and inhibited tumorigenesis in a mouse skin cancer model.

This evolution is facilitated in cancer cells by loss of fidelity in the processes that replicate, repair, and segregate the genome. Recent advances in our understanding of the cell cycle reveal how fidelity is normally achieved by the coordinated activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, checkpoint controls, and repair pathways and how this fidelity can be abrogated by specific genetic changes. These insights suggest molecular mechanisms for cellular transformation and may help to identify potential targets for improved cancer therapies.","Hartwell, L H;Kastan, M B"

A direct genetic strategy was developed to isolate subchromosomal transferable fragments (STFs) from any chromosome, each containing a selectable marker within the human DNA, that could be transferred to any mammalian cell. As a test of the method, several overlapping STFs from 11p15 were shown to cause in vitro growth arrest of rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

To study the functional significance of these mutations, the activated Ki-ras genes in two human colon carcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT 116, were disrupted by homologous recombination. Compared with parental cells, cells disrupted at the activated Ki-ras gene were morphologically altered, lost the capacity for anchorage-independent growth, grew more slowly both in vitro and in nude mice, and showed reduced expression of c-myc. Thus, the activated Ki-ras gene plays a key role in colorectal tumorigenesis through altered cell differentiation and cell growth.","Shirasawa, S;Furuse, M;Yokoyama, N;Sasazuki, T"

In tumorigenic cells, gene amplification occurs at a very high frequency, whereas in normal diploid fibroblasts the event is undetectable by the clonogenic assay. To investigate genetic control of gene amplification, amplification frequency was measured in hybrids of tumorigenic cells and normal diploid cells. The ability to amplify an endogenous gene behaved as a recessive genetic trait, and control of gene amplification potential segregated independently of tumorigenicity and immortality.","Tlsty, T D;White, A;Sanchez, J"

However, animals that rejected the IL-4-transfected tumors developed T cell-dependent systemic immunity to the parental tumor. This systemic immunity was tumor-specific and primarily mediated by CD8+ T cells. Established parental tumors could be cured by the systemic immune response generated by injection of the genetically engineered tumors.

Further analysis of the 5.71 cosmid revealed two regions that were highly conserved in rodent DNA. These sequences were used to identify a gene, MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer), which encodes an 829-amino acid protein with a short region of similarity to the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The rearrangement in the tumor disrupted the coding region of the MCC gene. Moreover, two colorectal tumors were found with somatically acquired point mutations in MCC that resulted in amino acid substitutions.

Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53.

Nine CpG islands, constituting a ""CpG island archipelago,"" were identified, including three islands that were not apparent by conventional pulsed-field mapping, and thus were at least partially methylated. Three distinct transcriptional units were found closely associated with a CpG island within the boundaries of a homozygous DNA deletion in a Wilms tumor.","Bonetta, L;Kuehn, S E;Huang, A;Law, D J;Kalikin, L M;Koi, M;Reeve, A E;Brownstein, B H;Yeger, H;Williams, B R"

Expression of WIT-1 and WIT-2 was restricted to kidney and spleen. RNase protection revealed divergent transcription of WIT-1 and WIT-2, originating from a DNA region of less than 600 bp. Both transcripts were present at high concentrations in fetal kidney and at much reduced amounts in 5-year-old and adult kidneys.

An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome. Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia. Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man. Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas. These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation. A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes.","Glaser, T;Lane, J;Housman, D"

A tumor-derived mouse p53 variant is now described, whose site of mutation corresponds to a hot spot for p53 in human tumors. While absolutely nonsuppressing, it is only weakly transforming and exhibits no detectable hsc70 binding.

These mutations, which activate alpha s by inhibiting its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, are found in codons for either of two amino acids, each of which is completely conserved in all known G protein alpha chains. The likelihood that similar mutations would activate other G proteins prompted a survey of human tumors for mutations that replace either of these two amino acids in other G protein alpha chain genes. The first gene so far tested, which encodes the alpha chain of Gi2, showed mutations that replaced arginine-179 with either cysteine or histidine in 3 of 11 tumors of the adrenal cortex and 3 of 10 endocrine tumors of the ovary. The mutant alpha i2 gene is a putative oncogene, referred to as gip2. In addition, gsp mutations were found in 18 of 42 GH-secreting pituitary tumors and in an autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma.

The chromosome location of the NF1 gene has been previously mapped genetically to 17q11.2, and data from two NF1 patients with balanced translocations in this region have further narrowed the candidate interval. The use of chromosome jumping and yeast artificial chromosome technology has now led to the identification of a large (approximately 13 kilobases) ubiquitously expressed transcript (denoted NF1LT) from this region that is definitely interrupted by one and most likely by both translocations. Previously identified candidate genes, which failed to show abnormalities in NF1 patients, are apparently located within introns of NF1LT, on the antisense strand. A new mutation patient with NF1 has been identified with a de novo 0.5-kilobase insertion in the NF1LT gene.

Identifying molecular mediators of this phenomenon should yield important clues to the mechanisms involved in RSV tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that TGF-beta is present locally shortly after wounding, but not unwounded controls. In addition, subcutaneous administration of recombinant transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) could substitute completely for wounding in tumor induction. A treatment protocol of four doses of 800 nanograms of TGF-beta resulted in v-src-expressing tumors with 100% frequency; four doses of only 10 nanograms still led to tumor formation in 80% of the animals. This effect was specific, as other growth factors with suggested roles in wound healing did not elicit the same response. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or TGF-alpha had no effect, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) yielded only occasional tumors after longer latency. TGF-beta release during the wound-healing response may thus be a critical event that creates a conducive environment for RSV tumorigenesis and may act as a cofactor for transformation in this system.","Sieweke, M H;Thompson, N L;Sporn, M B;Bissell, M J"

Yet, these observations do not define the timing of ras oncogene activation in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. To ascertain the timing of ras oncogene activation, an animal model system was devised that involves the induction of mammary carcinomas in rats exposed at birth to the carcinogen nitrosomethylurea. High-resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified ras sequences revealed the presence of both H-ras and K-ras oncogenes in normal mammary glands 2 weeks after carcinogen treatment and at least 2 months before the onset of neoplasia. These ras oncogenes can remain latent within the mammary gland until exposure to estrogens, demonstrating that activation of ras oncogenes can precede the onset of neoplasia and suggesting that normal physiological proliferative processes such as estrogen-induced mammary gland development may lead to neoplasia if the targeted cells harbor latent ras oncogenes.","Kumar, R;Sukumar, S;Barbacid, M"

To explore the possibility of a similar activity in a common adult tumor, RB expression was examined in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines. One of these, DU145, contained an abnormally small protein translated from an RB messenger RNA transcript that lacked 105 nucleotides encoded by exon 21. To assess the functional consequences of this mutation, normal RB expression was restored in DU145 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Cells that maintained stable exogenous RB expression lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice, although their growth rate in culture was apparently unaltered. These results suggest that RB inactivation can play a significant role in the genesis of a common adult neoplasm and that restoration of normal RB-encoded protein in tumors could have clinical utility.","Bookstein, R;Shew, J Y;Chen, P L;Scully, P;Lee, W H"

A contiguous stretch of DNA comprising 370 kilobase pairs (kb) has now been cloned from a region of chromosome 18q suspected to reside near this gene. Potential exons in the 370-kb region were defined by human-rodent sequence identities, and the expression of potential exons was assessed by an ""exon-connection"" strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction. Expressed exons were used as probes for cDNA screening to obtain clones that encoded a portion of a gene termed DCC; this cDNA was encoded by at least eight exons within the 370-kb genomic region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA specified a protein with sequence similarity to neural cell adhesion molecules and other related cell surface glycoproteins. While the DCC gene was expressed in most normal tissues, including colonic mucosa, its expression was greatly reduced or absent in most colorectal carcinomas tested. Somatic mutations within the DCC gene observed in colorectal cancers included a homozygous deletion of the 5' end of the gene, a point mutation within one of the introns, and ten examples of DNA insertions within a 0.17-kb fragment immediately downstream of one of the exons.

The majority of t(1;19)(q23;p13)-carrying leukemias and cell lines studied contained rearrangements of E2A as determined by DNA blot analyses. The rearrangements altered the E2A transcriptional unit, resulting in the synthesis of a transcript larger than the normal-sized E2A mRNAs in one of the cell lines with this translocation. These observations indicate that the gene for a transcription factor is located at the breakpoint of a consistently recurring chromosomal translocation in many acute leukemias and suggest a direct role for alteration of such factors in the pathogenesis of some malignancies.","Mellentin, J D;Murre, C;Donlon, T A;McCaw, P S;Smith, S D;Carroll, A J;McDonald, M E;Baltimore, D;Cleary, M L"

One monoclonal antibody, anti-APO-1, reacted with a 52-kilodalton antigen (APO-1) on a set of activated human lymphocytes, on malignant human lymphocyte lines, and on some patient-derived leukemic cells. Nanogram quantities of anti-APO-1 completely blocked proliferation of cells bearing APO-1 in vitro in a manner characteristic of a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Cell death was preceded by changes in cell morphology and fragmentation of DNA. This process was distinct from antibody- and complement-dependent cell lysis and was mediated by the antibody alone. A single intravenous injection of anti-APO-1 into nu/nu mice carrying a xenotransplant of a human B cell tumor induced regression of this tumor within a few days. Histological thin sections of the regressing tumor showed that anti-APO-1 was able to induce apoptosis in vivo. Thus, induction of apoptosis as a consequence of a signal mediated through cell surface molecules like APO-1 may be a useful therapeutic approach in treatment of malignancy.","Trauth, B C;Klas, C;Peters, A M;Matzku, S;Möller, P;Falk, W;Debatin, K M;Krammer, P H"

The functional consequences of activating a brain-specific neurotransmitter receptor, the serotonin 5HT1c receptor, in the unnatural environment of a fibroblast were examined. Introduction of functional 5HT1c receptors into NIH 3T3 cells results, at high frequency, in the generation of transformed foci. Moreover, the generation and maintenance of transformed foci requires continued activation of the serotonin receptor. In addition, the injection of cells derived from transformed foci into nude mice results in the generation of tumors. The serotonin 5HT1c receptor therefore functions as a protooncogene when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.","Julius, D;Livelli, T J;Jessell, T M;Axel, R"

The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene is amplified in 25 to 30 percent of human primary breast cancers and this alteration is associated with disease behavior. In this report, several similarities were found in the biology of HER-2/neu in breast and ovarian cancer, including a similar incidence of amplification, a direct correlation between amplification and over-expression, evidence of tumors in which overexpression occurs without amplification, and the association between gene alteration and clinical outcome. A comprehensive study of the gene and its products (RNA and protein) was simultaneously performed on a large number of both tumor types. This analysis identified several potential shortcomings of the various methods used to evaluate HER-2/neu in these diseases (Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) and provided information regarding considerations that should be addressed when studying a gene or gene product in human tissue. The data presented further support the concept that the HER-2/neu gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human cancers.","Slamon, D J;Godolphin, W;Jones, L A;Holt, J A;Wong, S G;Keith, D E;Levin, W J;Stuart, S G;Udove, J;Ullrich, A"

Clonal genetic variants of mouse epidermal JB6 cells that are genetically susceptible (P+) or resistant (P-) to promotion of transformation by TPA were transfected with 3XTRE-CAT, a construct that has AP-1 cis-enhancer sequences attached to a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Transfected JB6 P+, but not P- variants, showed TPA-inducible CAT synthesis.

Expression of the alpha-amylase gene had previously been thought to be confined to the liver parotid, and pancreas; however, analysis of white and brown adipose tissue from nontransgenic mice revealed expression of the endogenous Amy-1a gene in these tissues. Gene constructs driven by the Amy-1a liver promoter thus provide a means of targeting gene expression to the adipocyte cell lineage in transgenic mice.

Twenty chromosome 17p markers were used to localize the common region of deletion in these tumors to a region contained within bands 17p12 to 17p13.3. This region contains the gene for the transformation-associated protein p53. Southern and Northern blot hybridization experiments provided no evidence for gross alterations of the p53 gene or surrounding sequences. As a more rigorous test of the possibility that p53 was a target of the deletions, the p53 coding regions from two tumors were analyzed; these two tumors, like most colorectal carcinomas, had allelic deletions of chromosome 17p and expressed considerable amounts of p53 messenger RNA from the remaining allele. The remaining p53 allele was mutated in both tumors, with an alanine substituted for valine at codon 143 of one tumor and a histidine substituted for arginine at codon 175 of the second tumor. Both mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene that was previously found to be mutated in murine p53 oncogenes.

Three major conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (i) Allelic deletions were remarkably common; one of the alleles of each polymorphic marker tested was lost in at least some tumors, and some tumors lost more than half of their parental alleles. (ii) In addition to allelic deletions, new DNA fragments not present in normal tissue were identified in five carcinomas; these new fragments contained repeated sequences of the variable number of tandem repeat type. (iii) Patients with more than the median percentage of allelic deletions had a considerably worse prognosis than did the other patients, although the size and stage of the primary tumors were very similar in the two groups.

Changing cysteine at position 186 to serine in oncogenic forms produces a nonpalmitylated protein that fails to associate with membranes and does not transform NIH 3T3 cells. Nonpalmitylated p21Ras derivatives were constructed that contained myristic acid at their amino termini to determine if a different form of lipid modification could restore either membrane association or transforming activity. An activated p21Ras, altered in this way, exhibited both efficient membrane association and full transforming activity. Surprisingly, myristylated forms of normal cellular Ras were also transforming. This demonstrates that Ras must bind to membranes in order to transmit a signal for transformation, but that either myristate or palmitate can perform this role. However, the normal function of cellular Ras is diverted to transformation by myristate and therefore must be regulated ordinarily by some unique property of palmitate that myristate does not mimic. Myristylation thus represents a novel mechanism by which Ras can become transforming.","Buss, J E;Solski, P A;Schaeffer, J P;MacDonald, M J;Der, C J"

S1 nuclease protection assays revealed that transfection of full-length raf complementary DNA in the antisense orientation (AS) leads to a specific reduction (greater than tenfold) of steady-state levels of the endogenous c-raf-1 sense (S) transcript in SQ-20B cells. In nude mice, the malignant potential of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (S) was significantly increased relative to that of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (AS). SQ-20B cells containing transfected raf (S) maintained a radiation-resistant phenotype as compared to those cells harboring the AS version, which appeared to have enhanced radiation sensitivity.

To search for more subtle mutations, the ribonuclease protection method was used to analyze 4.7R messenger RNA from RB tumors. Five of 11 RB tumors, which exhibit normal 4.7R DNA and normal-sized RNA transcripts, showed abnormal ribonuclease cleavage patterns. Three of the five mutations affected the same region of the messenger RNA, consistent with an effect on splicing involving an as yet unidentified 5' exon. The high frequency of mutations in 4.7R supports the identification of 4.7R as the RB1 gene. However, the unusual nature of some of the abnormalities of 4.7 R alleles indicates that the accepted sequence of genetic events involved in the genesis of RB may require reevaluation.","Dunn, J M;Phillips, R A;Becker, A J;Gallie, B L"

3137658,1988.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Tumor formation dependent on proteoglycan biosynthesis.,"The role proteoglycans play in tumor formation was examined by measuring the tumorigenicity of proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants in nude mice. When 10(7) cells were injected subcutaneously, mutants with less than about 15% of the wild-type level of proteoglycan synthesis did not produce tumors. Mutants defective in the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans also did not form tumors, whereas mutants with altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were tumorigenic. Tumors arose from mixtures of wild-type and nontumorigenic mutant cells and contained both cell types, suggesting that wild-type cell proteoglycans enabled mutant cells to survive. The failure of heparan sulfate-deficient mutants to form tumors depended on the ability of the host to mount a B cell-mediated immune reaction.","Esko, J D;Rostand, K S;Weinke, J L"

Since allelic loss can be erroneously scored in nonhomogeneous samples, tumor cell populations were first microdissected from 24 colorectal carcinomas, an additional nine cancers were engrafted in nude mice, and nuclei were flow-sorted from an additional two. Of 31 cancers informative for chromosome 5 markers, only 6 (19%) showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 5 alleles, compared to 19 of 34 (56%) on chromosome 17, and 17 of 33 (52%) on chromosome 18. Therefore, it appears that (i) FPC is a true dominant for adenomatosis but not a common recessive gene for colon cancer; and (ii) simple Mendelian models involving loss of alleles at a single locus may be inappropriate for understanding common human solid tumors.","Law, D J;Olschwang, S;Monpezat, J P;Lefrançois, D;Jagelman, D;Petrelli, N J;Thomas, G;Feinberg, A P"

To determine whether the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) localized at 13q14, might be the target of recessive mutations in lung cancer, eight primary SCLC tumors and 50 cell lines representing all major histologic types of lung cancer were examined with the Rb complementary DNA probe. Structural abnormalities within the Rb gene were observed in 1/8 (13%) primary SCLC tumors, 4/22 (18%) SCLC lines, and 1/4 (25%) pulmonary carcinoid lines (comparable to the 20 to 40% observed in retinoblastoma), but were not detected in other major types of lung cancer. Rb messenger RNA expression was absent in 60% of the SCLC lines and 75% of pulmonary carcinoid lines, including all samples with DNA abnormalities. In contrast, Rb transcripts were found in 90% of non-SCLC lung cancer lines and in normal human lung. The finding of abnormalities of the Rb gene in SCLC and pulmonary carcinoids (both neuroendocrine tumors) suggests that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of a common adult malignancy.","Harbour, J W;Lai, S L;Whang-Peng, J;Gazdar, A F;Minna, J D;Kaye, F J"

This gene is now shown to be inactivated in two of nine human breast cancer cell lines examined. The RB gene of one cell line had a homozygous internal duplication of a 5-kilobase region containing exons 5 and 6. The RB messenger RNA transcript was correspondingly lengthened, and its translation was probably terminated prematurely due to a shifted reading frame. The other cell line had a homozygous deletion of the RB gene that removed the entire gene beyond exon 2. The RB gene product, pp110RB, was not detectable in either cell line by immuno-precipitation with specific antibodies.

By means of MPO complementary DNA clones for in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, the effect of this specific translocation on the MPO gene was examined. In all cases of M3 examined, MPO is translocated to chromosome 15. Genomic blot analyses indicate rearrangement of MPO in leukemia cells of two of four cases examined.

Mammary carcinomas induced by a single carcinogenic insult in pubescent rats was selected as an in vivo model system with direct relevance to human breast cancer. Acquisition of hormone-independent growth in these carcinogen-induced tumors was found to be independent of the activation of ras oncogenes during the early stages of carcinogenesis. In agreement with these observations, introduction of a human ras oncogene into human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells did not abrogate their hormonal dependency for growth in vivo.

Binding assays and affinity labeling of these cells with radioiodinated TGF-beta 1 revealed that the cells did not have TGF-beta receptors. The retinoblastoma cells lacked the three affinity-labeled proteins of 65, 95, and 300 kilodaltons typically seen in human cell lines and thus differed from normal retinal cells and from other types of neuroectodermal tumors that display the normal pattern of receptors.

The precursor mu RNA is either polyadenylated at the upstream poly(A) site (for the secreted form) or spliced (for the membrane-bound form) in a mutually exclusive manner. When the mouse mu gene linked to the SV40/HSV-TK hybrid promoter was microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, the mu messenger RNA (mRNA) was altered by coinjection of nuclei of mouse surface IgM-bearing B-lymphoma cells to include the synthesis of the membrane-bound form. An increase in the membrane-bound form was not observed when nuclei of IgM-secreting hybridoma cells or fibroblast cells were coinjected. Deletion of the upstream poly(A) site did not eliminate the effect of B-lymphoma nuclei suggesting that membrane-specific splicing is stimulated. Further, splicing of other mu gene introns was not affected by coinjection of B-lymphoma nuclei. These results suggest that mature B cells contain one or more transacting nuclear factors that stimulate splicing specific for membrane-bound mu mRNA.","Tsurushita, N;Ho, L;Korn, L J"

Evidence for this hypothesis was derived from experiments in vitro and in vivo with myeloid leukemia of rat. The following results were obtained: (i) in vitro, the percentage of cell differentiation at a fixed concentration of DF was inversely related to the concentration of cells; (ii) leukemic cell inoculates that were lethal to 7-day-old rats were rejected by 21-day-old rats; (iii) leukemic cells in diffusion chambers underwent differentiation in 21-day-old rats but not in 7-day-old rats; (iv) organs from 21-day-old rats contained more DF activity than those of 7-day-old rats; (v) treatment of rats with DF in diffusion chambers resulted in leukemic cell differentiation inside the chamber; and (vi) the development of leukemia in 7-day-old rats was aborted by treatment with DF. These results show that the differentiation of rat leukemia cells requires the appropriate level of DF. The proliferation of transplanted leukemia cells in 7-day-old rats goes unchecked because of inadequate generation of DF.

Transforming oncogenes of the ras family were capable of converting fibroblast cell lines to fully metastatic tumors. Cell lines transformed by the kinase oncogenes mos, raf, src, fes, and fms formed experimental metastases and (in some cases) these genes were more efficient at metastatic conversion than a mutant ras gene. In contrast, cells transformed by either of two nuclear oncogenes, myc or p53, were tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously but were virtually nonmetastatic after intravenous injection. These data demonstrate that, in addition to ras, a structurally divergent group of kinase oncogenes can induce the metastatic phenotype.","Egan, S E;Wright, J A;Jarolim, L;Yanagihara, K;Bassin, R H;Greenberg, A H"

The results presented here demonstrate a loss of heterozygosity of several genes on chromosome 11 in primary breast tumors. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of these DNAs further suggests that the most frequent loss of sequences in breast tumors occurs between the beta-globin and parathyroid hormone loci on the short arm of chromosome 11. The loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 11 loci has a significant association with tumors that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors, grade III tumors, and distal metastasis.","Ali, I U;Lidereau, R;Theillet, C;Callahan, R"

First, X-linked RFLPs were used to examine the pattern of X chromosome inactivation in colorectal tumors of females. All 50 tumors examined showed monoclonal patterns of X chromosome inactivation; these tumors included 20 carcinomas as well as 30 adenomas of either familial or spontaneous type. Second, RFLPs of autosomes were used as clonal markers to detect the somatic loss or gain of specific chromosomal sequences in colorectal tumors. Among other changes, it was found that somatic loss of chromosome 17p sequences occurred in over 75 percent of the carcinomas examined, but such loss was rare in adenomas. These data support a monoclonal origin for colorectal neoplasms, and suggest that a gene on the short arm of chromosome 17 may be associated with progression from the benign to the malignant state.","Fearon, E R;Hamilton, S R;Vogelstein, B"

A developmental analysis suggests at least a two-stage process in the ontogeny of this disease. The first stage is a T antigen-induced, preneoplastic state characterized by a progression from hyperplasia to dysplasia of the exocrine pancreas, by an increased percentage of tetraploid cells, and by an arrest in acinar cell differentiation. The second stage is characterized by the formation of tumor nodules that appear to be monoclonal, because they have discrete aneuploid DNA contents. The cells within the nodules as compared to normal pancreatic tissue have less total RNA by a factor of 5, less pancreas-specific messenger RNA by a factor of about 50, and increased levels of T-antigen messenger RNA. A tumor cell line has been derived that retains both pancreatic and neoplastic properties.","Ornitz, D M;Hammer, R E;Messing, A;Palmiter, R D;Brinster, R L"

In each hematopoietic lineage examined, expression of the c-myb gene is markedly downregulated during hematopoietic maturation. However, the mechanism by which differential expression of the c-myb gene is regulated is not known. In murine B-lymphoid tumor cell lines, the amount of steady-state c-myb mRNA is 10 to more than 100 times greater in pre-B cell lymphomas than in B cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas. The downregulation of c-myb mRNA correlates with events at the pre-B cell-B cell junction. Differential expression of c-myb mRNA levels detected between a pre-B cell lymphoma and a mature B cell lymphoma is now shown to be mediated by a block to transcription elongation in the first intron of the c-myb locus. In addition, this developmentally regulated difference in transcriptional activity is correlated with alterations in higher order chromatin structure as reflected by changes in the patterns of hypersensitivity to deoxyribonuclease I at the 5' end of the c-myb transcription unit. Regulation of transcription elongation may provide a more sensitive mechanism for rapidly increasing and decreasing mRNA levels in response to external stimuli than regulation of the initiation of transcription.","Bender, T P;Thompson, C B;Kuehl, W M"

The ability to distinguish between promotion of background tumors versus a genotoxic mechanism of tumor initiation by chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of rodent carcinogenesis data. Activated oncogenes in chemically induced and spontaneously occurring mouse liver tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased incidence of mouse liver tumors. Data suggest that furan and furfural caused an increased incidence in mouse liver tumors at least in part by induction of novel weakly activating point mutations in ras genes even though both chemicals did not induce mutations in Salmonella assays. In addition to ras oncogenes, two activated raf genes and four non-ras transforming genes were detected. The B6C3F1 mouse liver may thus provide a sensitive assay system to detect various classes of proto-oncogenes that are susceptible to activation by carcinogenic insult. As illustrated with mouse liver tumors, analysis of activated oncogenes in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced rodent tumors will provide information at a molecular level to aid in the use of rodent carcinogenesis data for risk assessment.","Reynolds, S H;Stowers, S J;Patterson, R M;Maronpot, R R;Aaronson, S A;Anderson, M W"

Simple serologic tests that unambiguously distinguish among infections by these retroviruses are essential. To that end, a partially conserved immunoreactive epitope was identified in the transmembrane glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2. Synthetic peptides derived from these conserved domains were used in sensitive and specific immunoassays that detect antibodies in sera from patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2. By making single amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 peptide, it was possible to demonstrate HIV-1 strain-specific antibody responses to this epitope. Such custom-designed peptides synthesized from this domain are likely to detect newly discovered HIV types, define infection with specific HIV strains, and allow detection of group-common antibodies.","Gnann, J W;McCormick, J B;Mitchell, S;Nelson, J A;Oldstone, M B"

The tat gene of HTLV-1 under control of its own long terminal repeat is capable of inducing tumors in transgenic mice. The morphologic and biologic properties of these tumors indicate their close resemblance to human neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen's disease), the most common single gene disorder to affect the nervous system. The high spontaneous incidence of this disease, together with the diverse clinical and pathologic features associated with it, suggests that environmental factors may account for some of the observed cases. Multiple tumors developed simultaneously in the transgenic tat mice at approximately 3 months of age, and the phenotype was successfully passed through three generations. The tumors arise from the nerve sheaths of peripheral nerves and are composed of perineural cells and fibroblasts. Tumor cells from these mice adapt easily to propagation in culture and continue to express the tat protein in significant amounts. When transplanted into nude mice, these cultured cells efficiently induce tumors. Evidence of HTLV-1 infection in patients with neural and other soft tissue tumors is needed in order to establish a link between infection by this human retrovirus and von Recklinghausen's disease and other nonlymphoid tumors.","Hinrichs, S H;Nerenberg, M;Reynolds, R K;Khoury, G;Jay, G"

One of the viral genes encodes a protein (tat) that not only results in transactivation of viral gene expression but may also regulate the expression of certain cellular genes that are important for cell growth. Transgenic mice that expressed the authentic tat protein under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat were generated, and cell types that are permissive for the viral promoter and the effects of the tat gene on these cells were studied. Three of eight founder mice with high levels of expression of the transgene in muscle were bred and then analyzed. All developed soft tissue tumors at multiple sites between 13 to 17 weeks of age. This phenotype was transmitted to nine of nine offspring that inherited the tat gene and were available for analysis. The remaining five founders expressed the transgene in the thymus, as well as in muscle. This second group of mice all exhibited extensive thymic depletion and growth retardation; in all of these mice, death occurred between 3 to 6 weeks of age before tumors became macroscopically visible. The tat gene under the control of the HTLV-1 regulatory region showed tissue-specific expression and the tat protein efficiently induced mesenchymal tumors.

A high incidence (six out of six) of raf sequences was found in transfected NIH/3T3 clones and the tumorigenic potential of SQ-20B DNA could be linked to genomic fragments that represent most of the kinase domain of human c-raf-1. An apparently unaltered 3.5-kilobase pair (kb) human c-raf transcript was identified in SQ-20B cells but was not observed in the transfected NIH/3T3 cell clones. Two new transcripts (4.2 kb and 2.6 kb) were found in tumorigenic clones; the large transcript was missing in a very poorly tumorigenic clone. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that the normal autosomes of chromosome 3 were absent in SQ-20B karyotypes and had formed apparently stable marker chromosomes. Unlike the recipient NIH/3T3 cell line, 30 percent of the transformed clone-1 metaphases had minute and double-minute chromosomes representative of amplified DNA sequences. The frequency of the c-raf-1 identification by NIH/3T3 transfection of SQ-20B DNA suggests the presence of some genetic abnormality within this locus.","Kasid, U;Pfeifer, A;Weichselbaum, R R;Dritschilo, A;Mark, G E"

During the course of these experiments, a transforming recombinant of bcr/abl was isolated which fuses gag determinants derived from helper virus to the NH2-terminus of the bcr/abl protein.

The ""suicide"" of these neoplastic T cells upon stimulation with antigen suggested the possibility that activation via the antigen-specific receptor could also inhibit the growth of neoplastic T cells in vivo. To test this, mice were subcutaneously inoculated with antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas and then treated intraperitoneally with antigen. Administration of the appropriate antigen immediately after inoculation with the T-cell hybridoma abrogated tumor formation; antigen administered after tumors had become established decreased the tumor burden and, in a substantial fraction of animals, led to long-term survival. The efficacy of antigen therapy was due to both a direct inhibitory effect on tumor growth and the induction of host immunity. These studies demonstrate the utility of cellular activation as a means of inhibiting neoplastic T-cell growth in vivo and provide a rationale for studying the use of less selective reagents that can mimic the activating properties of antigen, such as monoclonal antibodies, in the treatment of T-cell neoplasms of unknown antigen specificity.","Ashwell, J D;Longo, D L;Bridges, S H"

Cells from two HTLV-I seropositive Jamaican patients with CLL were fused with a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line.

Glycosylation mutants of a metastatic tumor cell line were selected that are deficient in both beta 1-6 GlcNAc transferase V activity and metastatic potential in situ. Moreover, induction of increased beta 1-6 branching in clones of a nonmetastatic murine mammary carcinoma correlated strongly with acquisition of metastatic potential.

To test the validity of the proposed origin of v-erbB and to investigate the functional significance of the deleted extracellular sequences, a chimeric gene encoding the extracellular and the transmembrane domain of the human EGF receptor joined to sequences coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the avian erbB oncogene product was constructed. When expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts, this reconstituted gene product (HER-erbB) was transported to the cell surface and bound EGF. Its autophosphorylation activity was stimulated by interaction with the ligand. Expression of the HER-erbB chimera led to anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and EGF-induced focus formation in Rat1 monolayers.

Acute myelomonocytic leukemia is characterized by neoplastic chromosome rearrangements involving band 16q22 in patients who carry the rare fragile site at 16q22. This specific leukemic breakpoint is within the metallothionein gene cluster, which is here shown to be proximal to the rare fragile site (FRA16B) and to a common fragile site (FRA16C) in this region. Hence neither of these fragile sites are at the breakpoint in this leukemic chromosomal rearrangement.","Simmers, R N;Sutherland, G R;West, A;Richards, R I"

Transgenic mice carrying a hybrid gene comprising the murine alpha A-crystallin promoter (-366 to +46) fused to the coding sequence of the SV40 T antigens developed lens tumors, which obliterated the eye cavity and even invaded neighboring tissue, thus establishing that the lens is not refractive to oncogenesis. Large-T antigen was detected early in lens development; it elicited morphological changes and specifically interfered with differentiation of lens fiber cells. Both alpha- and beta-crystallins persisted in many of the lens tumor cells, while gamma-crystallin was selectively reduced. Accessibility, characteristic morphology, and defined protein markers make this transparent epithelial eye tissue a potentially useful system for testing tumorigenicity of oncogenes and for studying malignant transformation from its inception until death of the animal.","Mahon, K A;Chepelinsky, A B;Khillan, J S;Overbeek, P A;Piatigorsky, J;Westphal, H"

This suppression of class I antigen expression, which contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype of the transformed cells, has also been observed in some naturally occurring cancers. In the present study, the rate of transcription initiation of class I genes was measured by a nuclear run-on assay in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed cells of three different types. The rate of transcription was the same in all three. The stability of the class I messenger RNA was also examined and found to be the same in all three cell types. The results indicate that in Ad12-transformed cells the suppression is caused by an inhibition of the post-transcriptional processing of class I MHC messenger RNA in the nucleus.","Vaessen, R T;Houweling, A;van der Eb, A J"

To study the molecular mechanism by which transporter activity is altered, cultured rodent fibroblasts transfected with activated myc, ras, or src oncogenes were used. In myc-transfected cells, the rate of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was unchanged. However, in cells transfected with activated ras and src oncogenes, the rate of glucose uptake was markedly increased. The increased transport rate in ras- and src-transfected cells was paralleled by a marked increase in the amount of glucose transporter protein, as assessed by immunoblots, as well as by a markedly increased abundance of glucose transporter messenger RNA. Exposure of control cells to the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 18 hours had a similar effect of increasing the rate of glucose transport and the abundance of transporter messenger RNA. For ras, src, and TPA, the predominant mechanism responsible for activation of the transport system is increased expression of the structural gene encoding the glucose transport protein.","Flier, J S;Mueckler, M M;Usher, P;Lodish, H F"

Five- to tenfold increases in total cellular glucose transporter protein in response to transformation were accompanied by similar increases in transporter messenger RNA levels. This, in turn, was preceded by an absolute increase in the rate of glucose transporter gene transcription within 30 minutes after shift of the temperature-sensitive FSV-transformed cells to the permissive temperature. The transporter messenger RNA levels in transformed fibroblasts were higher than those found in proliferating cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature. The activation of transporter gene transcription by transformation represents one of the earliest known effects of oncogenesis on the expression of a gene encoding a protein of well-defined function.","Birnbaum, M J;Haspel, H C;Rosen, O M"

A gene encoding a messenger RNA (mRNA) of 4.6 kilobases (kb), located in the proximity of esterase D, was identified as the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of this gene was abnormal in six of six retinoblastomas examined: in two tumors, RB mRNA was not detectable, while four others expressed variable quantities of RB mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. DNA from retinoblastoma cells had a homozygous gene deletion in one case and hemizygous deletion in another case, while the remainder were not grossly different from normal human control DNA. The gene contains at least 12 exons distributed in a region of over 100 kb. Sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones yielded a single long open reading frame that could encode a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids. A computer-assisted search of a protein sequence database revealed no closely related proteins. Features of the predicted amino acid sequence include potential metal-binding domains similar to those found in nucleic acid-binding proteins.

The c-myb proto-oncogene has been mapped to region 6q21-24, which suggests that it could be involved in the 6q- aberrations. By means of in situ chromosomal hybridization on cells from six hematopoietic malignancies, it was demonstrated that the c-myb locus is not deleted, but is retained on band q22, which is consistently bordered by the chromosomal breakpoints in both interstitial and terminal 6q- deletions. The deletion breakpoints were located at some distance from the myb locus since no rearrangement of c-myb sequences was found. In one case, however, amplification of the entire c-myb locus was detectable. Furthermore, in all cases tested that carry 6q- deletions, myb messenger RNA levels were significantly higher than in normal cells or in malignant cells matched for lineage and stage of differentiation but lacking the 6q- marker. These results indicate that 6q- deletions are accompanied by structural and functional alterations of the c-myb locus and that these alterations may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and lymphomas.","Barletta, C;Pelicci, P G;Kenyon, L C;Smith, S D;Dalla-Favera, R"

Antigen-negative cells within the population can escape detection and therapy by their failure to bind the appropriate antibody. Therefore, the extent of antigenic heterogeneity is an important consideration when designing protocols for the management of cancer by administration of monoclonal antibodies. One approach to counteracting the effect of antigenic heterogeneity is the use of clone A of recombinant human leukocyte interferon (Hu-IFN-alpha A). Administration of Hu-IFN-alpha A in vivo effectively increased the amount of tumor antigen expressed by a human colon xenograft in situ and augmented the localization of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to the tumor site. Concomitant administration of Hu-IFN-alpha A and monoclonal antibody may thus be effective in overcoming the antigenic heterogeneity of carcinoma cell populations and in enhancing the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the detection and treatment of carcinoma lesions.","Greiner, J W;Guadagni, F;Noguchi, P;Pestka, S;Colcher, D;Fisher, P B;Schlom, J"

Only 17% of the induced plasmacytomas that were karyotyped showed the characteristic chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus. Instead, all of the translocation-negative tumors demonstrated characteristic J-3 virus integration sites that were actively transcribed.

Furthermore, in chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus, tsNY68, the acylation of vinculin at the permissive temperature was less than one-third that at the nonpermissive temperature. Thus, the covalent binding of lipid to vinculin is a transformation-sensitive event. The covalent modification of vinculin by lipids could be directly or indirectly involved in its reversible association with membranes. This modification may also provide a mechanism to alter the organization of vinculin within cells and thereby play a regulatory role in anchoring or stabilizing microfilament bundles at plasma membranes.","Burn, P;Burger, M M"

HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer.

Signal sequences for V-J joining occurred at the breakpoint positions on both chromosomes 14 and 8, suggesting that the translocation occurs during TCR gene rearrangement and that it is catalyzed by the enzymatic systems involved in V-J joining reactions. The involvement of c-myc in the translocation and the association of joining signals at the breakpoints provides a parallel to the situation observed in the translocations involving c-myc and the immunoglobulin loci in B-cell neoplasms and suggests that common mechanisms of translocation and oncogene deregulation are involved in B- and T-cell malignancies.","Finger, L R;Harvey, R C;Moore, R C;Showe, L C;Croce, C M"

Fourteen of the patients had middle copy tumors, but this was almost always a result of chromosome duplication rather than the amplification of a small genetic locus. In contrast, five patients had high copy tumors, with the increased copy number in each case due to gene amplification. The amplification did not occur in a heterogeneous fashion within individual patients, since all metastatic lesions from patients with high copy lung tumors were also high copy, while none of 41 metastatic lesions from the other patients were high copy.

3486470,1986.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Deregulation of c-myc by translocation of the alpha-locus of the T-cell receptor in T-cell leukemias.,"Two human T-cell leukemias carrying a t(8;14)(q24;q11) chromosome translocation were studied for rearrangements and expression of the c-myc oncogene. For one leukemia, rearrangement was detected in a region immediately distal (3') to the c-myc locus; no rearrangements of c-myc were observed in the second case (DeF). However, studies with hybrids between human and mouse leukemic T cells indicated that in the leukemic cells of DeF, the breakpoint in chromosome 14 occurred between genes for the variable (V alpha) and the constant (C alpha) regions for the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor. The C alpha locus had translocated to a region more than 38 kilobases 3' to the involved c-myc oncogene. Since human c-myc transcripts were expressed only in hybrids carrying the 8q+ chromosome but not in hybrids containing the normal chromosome 8, it is concluded that the translocation of the C alpha locus 3' to the c-myc oncogene can result in its transcriptional deregulation.","Erikson, J;Finger, L;Sun, L;ar-Rushdi, A;Nishikura, K;Minowada, J;Finan, J;Emanuel, B S;Nowell, P C;Croce, C M"
3008337,1986.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)","The structure, function, and expression of interleukin-2 receptors on normal and malignant lymphocytes.","Antigen or mitogen-induced activation of resting T cells induces the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as well as the expression of specific cell surface receptors for this lymphokine. Failure of the production of either IL-2 or its receptor results in a failure of the T-cell immune response. The receptor is composed of a 33,000-dalton (251-amino acid) peptide precursor that is post-translationally glycosylated into the mature 55,000-dalton form. In contrast to resting T cells, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 receptors. Because IL-2 receptors are present on the malignant T cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia are treated with a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-2 receptor.","Waldmann, T A"
3457471,1986.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Human multidrug-resistant cell lines: increased mdr1 expression can precede gene amplification.,"The development of simultaneous resistance to multiple structurally unrelated drugs is a major impediment to cancer chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance in human KB carcinoma cells selected in colchicine, vinblastine, or Adriamycin is associated with amplification of specific DNA sequences (the multidrug resistance locus, mdr1). During colchicine selection resistance is initially accompanied by elevated expression of a 4.5-kilobase mdr1 messenger RNA (mRNA) without amplification of the corresponding genomic sequences. During selection for increased levels of resistance, expression of this mRNA is increased simultaneously with amplification of mdr1 DNA. Increased expression and amplification of mdr1 sequences were also found in multidrug-resistant sublines of human leukemia and ovarian carcinoma cells. These results suggest that increased expression of mdr1 mRNA is a common mechanism for multidrug resistance in human cells. Activation of the mdr1 gene by mutations or epigenetic changes may precede its amplification during the development of resistance.","Shen, D W;Fojo, A;Chin, J E;Roninson, I B;Richert, N;Pastan, I;Gottesman, M M"

A complementary DNA for the T lymphocyte-derived lymphokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been cloned, and recombinant GM-CSF protein has been expressed in yeast and purified to homogeneity. This purified human recombinant GM-CSF stimulated peripheral blood monocytes in vitro to become cytotoxic for the malignant melanoma cell line A375. Another T cell-derived lymphokine, gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), also stimulated peripheral blood monocytes to become tumoricidal against this malignant cell line.

When transformed cells were injected intravenously, all the ras single-gene transformants gave rise to many metastatic lung nodules. In contrast, cell lines transformed with ras and E1a did not generate metastases after subcutaneous injection and gave rise to very few metastatic lung nodules after intravenous injection.

In contrast, cycloheximide had little or no effect on the transcription of LTR driven genes in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts treated with the drug. These results suggest that a labile, cell type-specific protein may interact with the retroviral LTR and regulate transcription of genes under LTR control. Further, the results demonstrate that the increase in intracellular concentration of c-myc RNA induced by cycloheximide treatment of normal cells is the result of stabilization of this message.","Linial, M;Gunderson, N;Groudine, M"

After incubation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with [3H]myristic acid for 4 hours, the 36-kD protein contained covalently bound myristic acid by several criteria: (i) the radioactively labeled material comigrated with the 36-kD protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in one and two dimensions, (ii) the labeled material was insoluble in chloroform-methanol, and (iii) radioactively labeled myristate could be recovered from the purified 36-kD protein. The resistance of the acyl fatty acid moiety to hydrolysis by hydroxylamine suggested that the covalent linkage to the 36-kD protein may be through an amide linkage. The [3H]myristic-acid labeling of the 36-kD protein in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF showed a reduction of up to 45 percent when compared to an identical amount of 36-kD protein derived from normal cells; this reduction was not due to general changes in myristic acid metabolism in transformed cells.","Soric, J;Gordon, J A"

Replication-incompetent retrovirus particles (helper virus-free containing genomes that express the transforming envelope gene of SFFV (gp52) transformed bone marrow cells in vitro and, after direct intravenous introduction of the vector, induced malignant erythroid disease in vivo. Disease induction was dependent on prior treatment of mice with phenylhydrazine, which probably increased the availability of erythroid target cells. Since there was no evidence of virus particle expression in mice with malignant disease, this study demonstrates the acute oncogenic potential of a limited number of erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp52. Direct inoculation of animals with nonreplicating retroviral vectors containing transforming genes may be useful in study the oncogenic effects of such genes.","Wolff, L;Ruscetti, S"

Two of the probes detected DNA rearrangements in approximately 60 percent of the cases of follicular lymphoma screened. In follicular lymphoma, most of the breakpoints in band q21 of chromosome 18 were clustered within a short stretch of DNA, approximately 2.1 kilobases in length.

Comparison with normal T cells shows that neither IL-2 receptor gene organization nor IL-2 receptor messenger RNA processing are altered in the leukemic cells.

The mechanism for the gradual development of the transformed phenotype (a process termed ""progression"") was studied in type 5 adenovirus (Ad5)-transformed rat embryo cells. Progression was not correlated with major changes in the pattern of integration of viral DNA sequences. Instead, it was associated with an increased methylation of integrated viral sequences other than those corresponding to the E1 transforming genes of Ad5. A single exposure of progressed cells to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (Aza) resulted in a stable reversion to the unprogressed state of the original parental clone. A further selection of cells after growth in agar allowed the isolation of Aza-treated clones that had regained the progressed phenotype. These observations indicate that progression is a reversible process and suggest that progression may be associated with changes in the state of methylation of one or more specific genes.","Babiss, L E;Zimmer, S G;Fisher, P B"

The human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, which requires estradiol for tumor formation in vivo and shows growth stimulation in response to estradiol in vitro, is a model for hormone-responsive tumors. The v-rasH onc gene was transfected into MCF-7 cells. The cloned MCF-7ras transfectants, which expressed the v-rasH messenger RNA and v-rasH p21 protein (21,000 daltons), were characterized. In contrast to the parental cell line, MCF-7ras cells no longer responded to exogenous estrogen in culture and their growth was minimally inhibited by exogenous antiestrogens. When tested in the nude mouse, the MCF-7ras cells were fully tumorigenic in the absence of estrogen supplementation. Thus, cells acquiring an activated onc gene can bypass the hormonal regulatory signals that trigger the neoplastic growth of a human breast cancer cell line.","Kasid, A;Lippman, M E;Papageorge, A G;Lowy, D R;Gelmann, E P"

Because of this relationship these genes are now widely believed to be potential cancer genes. In some tumors, proto-onc genes are mutated or expressed more than in normal cells. Under these conditions, proto-onc genes are hypothesized to be active cancer genes in one of two possible ways: The one gene-one cancer hypothesis suggests that one activated proto-onc gene is sufficient to cause cancer. The multigene-one cancer hypothesis suggests that an activated proto-onc gene is a necessary but not a sufficient cause of cancer. However, mutated or transcriptionally activated proto-onc genes are not consistently associated with the tumors in which they are occasionally found and do not transform primary cells. Further, no set of an activated proto-onc gene and a complementary cancer gene with transforming function has yet been isolated from a tumor. Thus, there is still no proof that activated proto-onc genes are sufficient or even necessary to cause cancer.","Duesberg, P H"

Several naturally occurring tumors and virally transformed cells show an overall suppression of these surface antigens. Since the class I molecules are required in the presentation of neoantigens on tumor cells to the cytotoxic T lymphocytes, their absence from the cell surface may lead to the escape of these tumors from immunosurveillance. To test this possibility, a functional class I gene was transfected into human adenovirus 12-transformed mouse cells that do not express detectable levels of class I antigens; the transformants were tested for expression of the transfected gene and for changes in oncogenicity. The expression of a single class I gene, introduced by DNA-mediated gene transfer into highly tumorigenic adenovirus 12-transformed cells, was sufficient to abrogate the oncogenicity of these cells. This finding has important implications for the regulation of the malignant phenotype in certain tumors and for the potential modulation of oncogenicity through derepression of the endogenous class I genes.","Tanaka, K;Isselbacher, K J;Khoury, G;Jay, G"

This result contrasts with the findings that the decapitated c-myc gene, translocated to an immunoglobulin switch mu or alpha region, is transcriptionally silent in lymphoblastoid hybrids. Thus, there may be at least two distinct enhancer-like elements capable of deregulating c-myc transcription in lymphomas and leukemias with t(8;14) chromosome translocations. In addition, since the Daudi X lymphoblastoid hybrids express both the translocated and the normal c-myc gene, the c-myc gene product does not autoregulate c-myc transcription.","Croce, C M;Erikson, J;Huebner, K;Nishikura, K"

Prooxidant states can be caused by different classes of agents, including hyperbaric oxygen, radiation, xenobiotic metabolites and Fenton-type reagents, modulators of the cytochrome P-450 electron-transport chain, peroxisome proliferators, inhibitors of the antioxidant defense, and membrane-active agents. Many of these agents are promoters or complete carcinogens. They cause chromosomal damage by indirect action, but the role of this damage in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Prooxidant states can be prevented or suppressed by the enzymes of the cellular antioxidant defense and low molecular weight scavenger molecules, and many antioxidants are antipromoters and anticarcinogens. Finally, prooxidant states may modulate the expression of a family of prooxidant genes, which are related to cell growth and differentiation, by inducing alterations in DNA structure or by epigenetic mechanisms, for example, by polyadenosine diphosphate-ribosylation of chromosomal proteins.","Cerutti, P A"

Percentages of each cell subpopulation in these spheroids were estimated with the sister chromatid exchange assay and were found to be approximately the same as those used to initiate spheroids. Spheroids grown from 9L cells alone had a higher growth rate than spheroids grown from R3 cells alone. However, the growth rate of mixed-cell spheroids was essentially the same as that of pure 9L spheroids and was independent of the percentages of R3 cells in mixed-cell spheroids. The sensitivity of 9L cells in mixed-cell spheroids treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, estimated by changes in the number of sister chromatid exchanges per metaphase induced by treatment, decreased as the percentage of R3 cells increased. These effects are probably the result of an interaction between the two cell subpopulations held in three-dimensional contact, a situation similar to that in tumors in situ. The results suggest why one cell subpopulation of tumors does not become dominant during growth and indicate that interactions between cell subpopulations can influence the sensitivity of one subpopulation to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea.","Tofilon, P J;Buckley, N;Deen, D F"

Their genomes are relatively simple, containing the genes gag, pol, env, and a 3' region termed ""X."" This 3' region may be responsible for the transforming potential of the viruses. The existence of proteins encoded by the 3' region has been postulated on the basis of multiple open reading frames. In the present study this region is shown to contain a gene encoding a protein of 40 kilodaltons in HTLV-I and 37 kilodaltons in HTLV-II. It is proposed that these proteins be called, respectively, p40xI and p37xII.","Slamon, D J;Shimotohno, K;Cline, M J;Golde, D W;Chen, I S"

This report describes the cloning of a fragment of the mouse K-ras oncogene containing the first exon from both a transformant in rat-2 cells and the brain of the same mouse that developed the tumor. Hybrid constructs containing one of the two pieces were made and only the plasmid including the first exon from the transformant gave rise to foci in NIH 3T3 cells. There was only a single base difference (G----A) in the exonic sequence, which changed glycine to aspartic acid in the transformant. By use of a synthetic oligonucleotide the presence of the mutation was demonstrated in the original tumor, ruling out modifications during DNA-mediated gene transfer and indicating that the alteration was present in the thymic lymphoma but absent from other nonmalignant tissue. The results are compatible with gamma radiation being a source of point mutations.","Guerrero, I;Villasante, A;Corces, V;Pellicer, A"

A transforming gene present in late passages of PA1 cells was isolated as a biologically active molecular clone and is a new isolate of the human rasN locus. Its transforming activity is due to a single G---A (G, guanine; A, adenine) point mutation at the codon for amino acid 12 which changes the codon for glycine so that an aspartic acid residue is expressed. In contrast to late passage PA1 cells (passages 106, 330, and 338), DNA from the PA1 cell line at early passages (passage 36) does not yield rasN foci in DNA transfection assays.

The loss or inactivation of both alleles of this gene appears to be a primary mechanism in the development of retinoblastoma. Such a mechanism is in direct contrast to that of putative human oncogenes which are thought to induce tumorigenesis following activation or alteration. The high incidence of second primary tumors among patients who inherit one inactive retinoblastoma allele also suggests that this cancer gene plays a key role in the etiology of several other primary malignancies. Finally, the observation that extra nonrandom copies of specific chromosomal regions occur in some of these tumors provides circumstantial evidence that an ""expressor"" gene (possibly an oncogene) may be involved in retinoblastoma development.","Murphree, A L;Benedict, W F"

This mutation creates a restriction enzyme polymorphism that can be used to screen human cells for transforming K-ras genes. This approach was used to identify the mutational event responsible for the malignant activation of a K-ras oncogene in a squamous cell lung carcinoma of a 66-year-old man; this point mutation was not present in either the normal bronchial or parenchymal tissue or in the blood lymphocytes. Hence, malignant activation of a ras oncogene appears to be specifically associated with the development of a human neoplasm.","Santos, E;Martin-Zanca, D;Reddy, E P;Pierotti, M A;Della Porta, G;Barbacid, M"

Translocations between chromosomes 8 and 22 have occurred in all three lines, but the cells synthesize immunoglobulin M with light chains of the kappa type, in contrast to the usual concordance between a translocation involving chromosome 22 and lambda chain synthesis. Both kappa genes and one lambda gene are rearranged. These findings indicate either that translocation may occur as a separate event from immunoglobulin gene rearrangement or that the proposed hierarchical sequence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements is not always adhered to.

In the case of Burkitt lymphoma, such a translocation joins the cellular oncogene, c-myc, to a region encoding one of the immunoglobulin genes. In at least one example, the coding sequence of the rearranged c-myc gene is identical to that of the normal gene, implying that the gene must be quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, altered in its expression if it is to play a role in transformation. One might expect to find the rearranged c-myc gene in a configuration that would allow it to take advantage of one of the known immunoglobulin promoters or enhancer elements. However, the rearranged c-myc gene is often placed so that it can utilize neither of these structures. Since the level of c-myc messenger RNA is often elevated in Burkitt cells, the translocation may lead to a deregulation of the c-myc gene. Further, since the normal allele in a Burkitt cell is often transcriptionally silent in the presence of a rearranged allele, a model for c-myc regulation is suggested that involves a trans-acting negative control element that might use as its target a highly conserved portion of the c-myc gene encoding two discrete transcriptional promoters.","Leder, P;Battey, J;Lenoir, G;Moulding, C;Murphy, W;Potter, H;Stewart, T;Taub, R"

6336310,1983.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",The chromosomal basis of human neoplasia.,"High-resolution banding techniques for the study of human chromosomes have revealed that the malignant cells of most tumors analyzed have characteristic chromosomal defects. Translocations of the same chromosome segments with precise breakpoints occur in many leukemias and lymphomas, and a specific chromosome band is deleted in several carcinomas. Trisomy, or the occurrence of a particular chromosome in triplicate, is the only abnormality observed in a few neoplasias. It is proposed that chromosomal rearrangements play a central role in human neoplasia and may exert their effects through related genomic mechanisms. Thus, a translocation could serve to place an oncogene next to an activating DNA sequence, a deletion to eliminate an oncogene repressor, and trisomy to carry extra gene dosage.","Yunis, J J"

The factor's ability to induce plasminogen activator was insensitive to treatment with nucleases, but its activity was destroyed by digestion with proteases. It is proposed that such a factor would play a role in malignancy if it would recruit normal cells that were adjacent to transformed cells to produce plasminogen activator which could result in tumor-promoted proteolysis.","Davies, R L;Rifkin, D B;Tepper, R;Miller, A;Kucherlapati, R"

When the mice were inoculated subcutaneously with melanoma cells at 10 to 11 months of age, the primary tumor grew more slowly in obese than in lean littermates and the frequency of lung metastasis was greatly reduced. When the mice were injected with the cells at 4 to 7 months, the primary tumor grew at the same rate in obese and lean mice, but the obese mice again showed a significantly reduced frequency of lung metastasis. That this effect was related to an enhanced immunocompetence in obese mice was supported by the finding that splenic lymphocytes of ob/ob mice showed three times the proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A compared with the proliferative response of lean control mice. The ob/ob mouse may provide a model for the study of enhanced immunocompetence in obese individuals.","Thompson, C I;Kreider, J W;Black, P L;Schmidt, T J;Margules, D L"

Mouse B16 melanoma sublines were used to determine the relation between metastatic properties and the ability of the sublines to degrade enzymatically the sulfated glycosaminoglycans present in the extracellular matrix of cultured vascular endothelial cells. Highly invasive and metastatic B16 sublines degraded matrix glycosaminoglycans faster than did sublines of lower metastatic potential. The main products of this matrix degradation were heparan sulfate fragments. Intact B16 cells (or their cell-free homogenates) with a high potential for lung colonization degraded purified heparan sulfate from bovine lung at higher rates than did B16 cells with a poor potential for lung colonization. Analysis of the degradation fragments indicated that B16 cells have a heparan sulfate endoglycosidase. Thus the abilities of B16 melanoma cells to extravasate and successfully colonize the lung may be related to their capacities to degrade heparan sulfate in the walls of pulmonary blood vessels.","Nakajima, M;Irimura, T;Di Ferrante, D;Di Ferrante, N;Nicolson, G L"

For chemicals with metabolites that interact with DNA, it may be more meaningful to relate tumor response to the concentration of the DNA adducts in the target organ rather than to the applied dose. Many data suggest that the relation between tumor response and concentration of DNA adducts in the target organ may be linear. This implies that the nonlinearities of the dose-response curve for tumor induction may be due to the kinetic processes involved in the formation of carcinogen metabolite--DNA adducts. Of particular importance is the possibility that the kinetic processes may show a nonlinear ""hockey-stick"" like behavior which results from saturation of detoxification or DNA repair processes. The mathematical models typically used for low-dose extrapolation are shown potentially to overestimate risk by several orders of magnitude when nonlinear kinetics are present.","Hoel, D G;Kaplan, N L;Anderson, M W"

The known virus isolates from the United States and Japan are closely related and are found in adults with an acute malignancy of mature T cells. A related retrovirus has been found in a patient (Mo) with a somewhat different disease (a T-cell variant of relatively benign hairy cell leukemia). Serum from Mo contains antibodies to the major internal core protein (p24) of HTLV. A T-cell line established from the spleen of Mo expresses HTLV antigens. However, HTLV from Mo is significantly different from all previous HTLV isolates in immunological cross-reactivity tests of p24. The usual prototype HTLV isolate is represented as HTLV-I, and the HTLV from Mo is represented as HTLV-II. Individual members of each subgroup may then be identified by subscript initials of the patient [for example, HTLV-I(CR), HTLV-I(MB), and HTLV-II(Mo)].","Kalyanaraman, V S;Sarngadharan, M G;Robert-Guroff, M;Miyoshi, I;Golde, D;Gallo, R C"

Since most connective tissue planes in the breast radiate toward the nipple, compound scans from the sides of the breast record normal interfaces more consistently and reveal greater symmetries in normal portions of relatively full breasts than do conventional scans in sagittal or transverse planes. Simultaneous acquisition of the pulse echo images and images representing the local ultrasound attenuation coefficient and speed of ultrasound suggested complementary role for reflection and through-transmission images in breast cancer detection. The high quality of pulse echo images in coronal planes provides the potential for more complete pulse echo diagnosis and the basis for spatial correlation of lesions viewed in pulse echo and ultrasonic computed tomograms. These observations may permit routine ultrasonic computed tomography of the breast in the clinical setting.","Carson, P L;Meyer, C R;Scherzinger, A L;Oughton, T V"
7302565,1981.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Ranking animal carcinogens: a proposed regulatory approach.,"The nature and extent of positive evidence associated with animal carcinogens vary widely, yet present regulatory policy does not permit adequate discrimination among the many carcinogenic substances. Most are treated as if they pose equal potential risk to humans, and this is not consistent with the available data. Without knowledge of carcinogenic mechanisms, the evaluation of responses in intact mammalian surrogates best reflects the potential levels of human risk. An example of a scoring system is proposed by which animal carcinogens are ranked according to the most relevant toxicological evidence derived from animal and genotoxicity studies. Different classes of animal carcinogens could thus be recognized and would permit several regulatory options and provide a means to establish priorities for public and scientific concerns.","Squire, R A"

Immunocytochemical tests show that they contain both immunoreactive renin and angiotensin; direct radioimmunoassays show that they are positive for renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II; enzymatic assays show that they contain angiotensinogen and converting enzyme as well. The renin appears to be present in an enzymatically inactive form that can be activated by trypsin and then blocked by antiserum to purified mouse submaxillary renin. Renin concentration and activity are increased by enhancing cellular differentiation with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate or by serum withdrawal. These findings demonstrate a complete renin-angiotensin system within these neuron-like cells, and suggest that activation of intracellular renin could generate angiotensin II.","Fishman, M C;Zimmerman, E A;Slater, E E"

Considerable knowledge of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis has accrued in the last 20 years, particularly concepts on the metabolic activation of chemicals to reactive electrophilic compounds that can interact with nucleophilic including DNA. These developments, in turn, have yielded a framework for integrating into carcinogen testing the determination of genetic effects of chemicals. A systematic decision point approach to carcinogen testing has been developed which entails a sequential decision-making process as specific tests are performed and evaluated prior to initiation of higher order, more complex tests. Compared to conventional bioassays in rodents, this approach provides knowledge based on mechanisms of carcinogenesis, yields a substantial amount of data at minimal cost, and forms a solid base for eventual heath risk assessment.","Weisburger, J H;Williams, G M"

Arginine acted synergistically with dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (10(-6) molar) to enhance the growth inhibitory effect: the cell replication ceased completely within 2 days after treatment. The growth arrest accompanied a change in cell morphology and was preceded by increases in the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP, adenylate cyclase, and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activities as well as a decrease of estrogen binding activity. The results suggest that growth of human breast cancer cells is subject to cyclic AMP-mediated regulation and that arginine may play a specific role in this process.","Cho-Chung, Y S;Clair, T;Bodwin, J S;Berghoffer, B"

The results revealed that the development of retinoblastoma was associated with a constitutional chromosome deletion del(13)(q13.1q14.5) and that the unaffected transmitting state was associated with a balanced insertional translocation. These findings indicate that predisposition to retinoblastoma may be attributed to the loss of specific genetic material and that a chromosomal mechanism may explain apparent lack of gene penetrance in certain families. The development of unilateral, and not bilateral, retinoblastoma suggests either that the chromosome deletion is different from the mutation of heritable retinoblastoma in general, or that the chromosome deletion lessens the probability of subsequent somatic carcinogenic events.","Strong, L C;Riccardi, V M;Ferrell, R E;Sparkes, R S"

Second, precise estimates of low-dose risks based largely on high-dose data, for which the sample size requirements are more easily satisfied, must depend heavily on assumptions about the shape of the dose-response curve, even when only a few of the parameters of the theoretical form of the curve are unknown.","Land, C E"

Previous observations that halothane anesthesia plus hind-limb amputation increases the number of metastases were confirmed. Amputation under the analgesia of electrical stimulation of the midbrain was found to increase metastatic activity. However, the stimulus-produced analgesia alone also increased the number of metastases. Systemically administered naloxone blocked the analgesic effect of midbrain stimulation but did not block the increase in the number of pulmonary metastases.","Simon, R H;Lovett, E J;Tomaszek, D;Lundy, J"

Paradoxically, in nude mice, growth of these cells and formation of solid tumors are dependent on estrogen. Tumors fail to develop in ovariectomized mice, but do develop in intact mice and in ovariectomized mice given estrogen. Primary cultures derived from MCF-7 tumors revert to unresponsiveness to estrogen. However, when these cultures are again transplanted into nude mice, estrogen is required for tumor formation. The continuous culture, the solid tumor, and the primary cultures therefrom have similar estrogen-binding capacities and affinities. These results indicate that mammary carcinoma cell growth in vivo is subject to inhibition that can be overcome by estrogen.","Shafie, S M"

Although there may be such influence, supplementary hypotheses are also possible. The nickeliferous ores from at least one major smelter in New Caledonia (excess numbers of cancers have been found in these smelter workers) are derived from serpentinized host rocks which contain large amounts of chrysotile asbestos. Analysis indicates that nickel ores from this area are heavily contaminated by these fibers. The deposits are mined for their nickel content, but workers may be exposed to the asbestos fibers contained in the deposits. Hygiene measures limited to the avoidance of nickel may be inadequate under such circumstances and should be reevaluated so as to prevent the inhalation of asbestos-containing dusts.","Langer, A M;Rohl, A N;Selikoff, I J;Harlow, G E;Prinz, M"

The postulated susceptibility allele in these families may be chromosomally linked to the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.2, alanine aminotransferase) locus. Confirmation of this linkage in other families would establish the existence of a gene increasing susceptibility to breast cancer.

Similar relations displaced by species-dependent response ratios also provide satisfactory descriptions of the reported data on deaths from primary bone cancers in people and mice exposed to radium-226. The median cumulative doses (or times) leading to death from bone tumors are 2.9 times larger for dogs than for mice and 3.6 times larger for people than for dogs. These response ratios are well correlated with the normal life expectancies. The cumulative radiation dose required to give significant risk of bone cancer is found to be much less at lower dose rates than at higher rates, but the time required for the tumors to be manifested is longer. At low dose rates, this time exceeds the normal life-span and appears as a practical threshold, which for bone cancer is estimated to occur at an average cumulative radiation dose to the skeleton of about 50 to 110 rads for the three species.","Raabe, O G;Book, S A;Parks, N J"

It is well established that smooth-surfaced foreign bodies, regardless of their chemical composition, will produce sarcomas when transplanted subcutaneously in rodents.

The malignant neoplasms exhibit fast, autonomous growth, loss of the capacity for differentiation, increased mobility and invasiveness, lethality in situ and after transplantation, and histological, fine structural, and karyotypic abnormalities. Intermediate neoplasms are also found. These combine both benign and malignant qualities. They grow in a noninvasive, compact fashion, typical of benign tumors, yet they also exhibit malignant qualities such as fast, autonomous, and lethal growth, loss of differentiation capacity, changes in cellular morphology, and lethal growth after transplantation into wild-type hosts.

When this occurs, a new nonhistone protein species becomes the predominant endogenous substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the tumor nuclei. Phosphorylation of this regression-associated protein ceases when resumption of tumor growth is induced by either the injection of 17 beta-estradiol or cessation of dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment. Thus phosphorylation of regression-associated protein may play a role in the regression of hormone-dependent mammary tumors.","Cho-Chung, Y S;Redler, B H"

Both this lipid peroxidation and cardiac toxicity of adriamycin are reduced by prior treatment of the animals with the free radical scavenger tocopherol. Such treatment with tocopherol does not, however, alter the magnitude or duration of the adriamycin-induced suppression of DNA synthesis in P388 ascites tumor, nor does it diminish the antitumor responsiveness of P388 ascites tumor. These results suggest that adriamycin has at least two mechanisms of tissue damage: one, which involves lipid peroxidation, is blocked by tocopherol and results in cardiac toxicity; the other, which involves binding to DNA, is not antagonized by tocopherol and is responsible for tumor response.","Myers, C E;McGuire, W P;Liss, R H;Ifrim, I;Grotzinger, K;Young, R C"

A direct relationship was observed between the amount of serum protein-bound sialic acid and serum sialyltransferase activity in all rats studied. Serum sialyltransferase activity in rats with a representative metastasizing mammary tumor, SMT-2A, was also correlated with tumor age. Microsomes prepared from the SMT-2A tumor have a sixfold higher sialyltransferase activity than do microsomes prepared from the nonmetastasizing mammary tumor MT-W9B. Normal rat liver microsomes have the same level of activity as microsomes prepared from livers of animals with either SMT-2A or MT-W9B tumors. The data indicate that spontaneously metastasizing mammary tumor cells have an increased production and release, perhaps through cell surface shedding, of a sialyltransferase. It is suggested that this sialyltransferase may increase the serum half-life of certain tumor-specific circulating glycoconjugates by increasing the content of protein-bound sialic acid and may thereby play a role in the immune escape mechanism of metastasizing tumor cells.","Bernacki, R J;Kim, U"

959840,1976.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",The clonal evolution of tumor cell populations.,"It is proposed that most neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin, and tumor progression results from acquired genetic variability within the original clone allowing sequential selection of more aggressive sublines. Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment. More research should be directed toward understanding and controlling the evolutionary process in tumors before it reaches the late stage usually seen in clinical cancer.","Nowell, P C"

Whereas splenocytes from normal noninfected animals showed the expected morphologic classes of lymphocytes, including those with smooth surfaces and with numerous villous projections, an alteration of cell type was evident within a few days after infection. Friend leukemia virus caused a rapid decrease in the number of villous cells, with a concomitant increase in the number of cells with smoother surfaces. By the end of the first 1 to 12 weeks after infection the majority of cells were smooth, many showing distinct morphologic changes, including ""holes"" and a spongy appearance. Nearly all of the splenocytes were abnormal in appearance by days 17 to 30 after infection, with most showing a spongy topography. These changes paralleled the marked immunosuppression induced by Friend leukemia virus infection, as well as the appearance of virus-associated surface antigen on individual splenocytes. Topographic changes evident by examination with scanning electron microscopy were not readily apparent by either standard histology or transmission electron microscopy.","Farber, P;Specter, S;Friedman, H"

On the reasoning that anchorage dependence might also apply in vivo, each of nine mice were subcutaneously inoculated with an average of 15,400 Balb/3T3 cells attached to two glass beads 3 millimeters in diameter. After 8 weeks, all the mice had developed large bloody tumors that microscopically proved to be hemangioendotheliomas. Ther inoculation of Balb/3T3 cells alone or beads alone produced no tumors. Transplants of each tumor into normal mice grew to kill the animal within 6 weeks. Tumor cells from collagenase-disaggregated tumor tissue had a plating efficiency of 21.2 percent compared to that of normal adult subcutaneous fibroblasts of less than 0.1 percent. The tumor cells in vitro closely resembled Balb/3T3 cells in appearance and were tumorigenic at a dose of 10-4 cells. A second, repeat experiment produced the same type of tumors grossly and microscopically in 17 of 25 mice between 99 and 211 days after inoculation of the Balb/3T3 cells attached to glass beads.

Studies of populations exposed to radiation in childhood show a dose response over a wide dose range.,"The incidence of thyroid carcinoma and of clinically palpable thyroid nodules is compared in three groups of individuals many years after exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood or infancy. The estimated mean cumulative doses to the thyroid gland ranged from 20 rad in the Ann Arbor series irradiated with x-rays as infants for thymic enlargement upward to 1225 rad of mixed radiation (including that from ingested radioiodine) in the Marshallese children. Intermediate between these extremes is the high-risk subgroup in the Rochester series of persons irradiated for thymic enlargement; they received an estimated mean thyroid dose of 335 rad. A plot of the incidence of thyroid nodularity against the total cumulative thyroid dose gives what could be a linear dose response with no threshold or, at least, a threshold below 20 rad. The risk of developing carcinoma in the three studies ranges from 0 to 5.5 cases and that for nodularity 38 to 52 cases per 106 persons exposed per rad (thyroid dose) per year. There is evidence dence from animal experimentation that the biologically effective dose in the case of the Marshallese would have been considerably lower than the cumulative physical dose; hence, the dose response might actually be curvilinear at least in the higher dose range. In view of the uncertainties regarding dose and the assumptions made in my study, the risk values may not be exact; however, these values reflect the trends regarding risks estimated from the best available data in man. Furthermore, the estimated risk values apply only if radiation exposure occurred in childhood.","Hempelmann, L H"

Its growth can be sustained and propagated by hormonal function in the host which is not unusual in kind or exaggerated in rate but which is operating at normal or even subnormal levels. Hormones, or synthetic substances inducing physiologic effects similar thereto, are of crucial significance for survival of several kinds of hormone-responsive cancers in man and animals. Opposite sorts of change of the hormonal status can induce regression and, in some instances, cure such cancers. These modifications are deprivation of essential hormones and hormone interference by giving large amounts of critical compounds. The control of cancer by endocrine methods can be described in three propositions: (i) Some types of cancer cells differ in a cardinal way from the cells from which they arose in their response to change in their hormonal environment. (ii) Certain cancers are hormone-dependent and these cells die when supporting hormones are eliminated. (iii) Certain cancers succumb when large amounts of hormones are administered.","Huggins, C"

By systematic testing of already known human viruses for oncogenic properties, it was found that in hamsters injected intrapulmonarily with tissue culture fluid of human type 12 adenovirus within 24 hours after birth there was a very high incidence of malignant tumors at the site of injection in from 1 to 3 months. The tumorinducing activity was not lost by filtration through Selas 02 filters or by tissue culture passages in HeLa cells.

No such tumors occurred in hamsters injected with control tissue culture fluid or with culture fluids of the other viruses tested, or in control breeder hamsters. The possibility that contamination with polyoma virus and simian virus 40 might be responsible for the tumors induced was specifically excluded by a variety of tests. The possible involvement of still other, as yet unknown, contaminant viruses was excluded by a positive association of the tumor-inducing ability with the adenovirus content.

In control mice of the same subline, the incidence of spontaneous lymphoma is about 1 percent. No leukemogenic activity could be detected in filtrates from thymi harvested at 2 to 32 days following completion of x-ray treatment. Activity was evident at 64 days and was perhaps somewhat greater at 128 days. Serial cell-free passage of filtrates in newborn F(1) hybrid mice resulted in a marked increase in lymphoma incidence (69 percent), coupled with a shortening of the median latency.

13635004,1959.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Spectroscopic evidence of metabolic control.,"The Pasteur and Crabtree effects demonstrate that changes at the beginning of the metabolic sequence for glucose metabolism give rise to effects at the end, and vice versa. We have presented here three additional responses of the ascites tumor cell suspensions, and presumably more will be uncovered. Each one of these responses is a manifestation of factors in the underlying mechanism that are in the nature of chemical feedback of a linear or nonlinear nature. The metabolic reactions are sufficiently complex that it is unlikely that any single component or step need control metabolism in different types of cells or under all conditions for a particular cell. However, it is due to a favorable circumstance that, in an appropriate type of cell and with the use of a direct intracellular indicator for changes in ADP concentration, we can state that the respiratory metabolism of the ascites tumor cell suspension, as freshly withdrawn from the mouse abdomen, is limited by the intracellular ADP concentration, and that this is why these cells show a predominance of glycolytic over respiratory activity. The response of the metabolism to small and large additions of glucose illustrates aspects of the metabolic mechanism which involve control of endogenous metabolism and compartmentalization of ATP formed in oxidative phosphorylation, the net result being a depression of the respiratory activity. The results of this approach emphasize the importance of chemical assays of localized portions of the living cell in its physiological state (61).","CHANCE, B;HESS, B"

13580239,1958.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Critique of the linear theory of carcinogenesis.,"1) Present data on human leukemogenesis by radiation fail to indicate a linear relation between dose and effect. Because data are scanty, such a hypothesis cannot be ruled out statistically, but it is less probable than a nonlinear or threshold relation. 2) Other instances in which carcinogenic agents have been examined from the standpoint of dose and dose-rate relations show many clear instances where the relation is nonlinear and none in which linearity is unquestionably demonstrated. 3) Theoretical consideration of the probability that a single critical molecular event, such as a mutation, will give rise to cancer indicate that a malignant change must be an extraordinarily improbable result of such a perturbation. It is also very difficult to reconcile this mechanism with the rather comparable spontaneous and induced-cancer incidences in species with greatly different numbers of cells. 4) Any scheme in which multiple events caused by the carcinogen are required to produce a tumor is incompatible with a linear relation, while, if a disordered state of tissue is an important factor, a true threshold may even occur. There is much evidence, from cancer research of all sorts, indicating that one or both of these conditions is involved in the carcinogenic process.","BRUES, A M"
13421705,1957.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Leukemia and ionizing radiation.,"Leukemia in man can be induced by ionizing radiations and also occurs spontaneously. For the ""average"" individual in a population, the probability of developing radiation-induced leukemia is estimated to be 2 x 10(-6) per rad (unit of absorbed dose of radiation) per year. The available data from four independent sources make it likely that this estimate is valid within a factor of about 3, giving a range from 0.7 x 10(-6) to 6 x 10(-6) per rad per year. It is pointed out that 10 to 20 percent of the spontaneous incidence of leukemia (Brooklyn, 1943-52) may result from radiation from natural background sources. It is estimated that a 5- to 10-percent increase in the current spontaneous incidence of leukemia would occur if the population were to reach and maintain a body level of Sr(90) amounting to one-tenth of the ""maximum permissible concentration.""","LEWIS, E B"
13195669,1954.0,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Significance of enzymatically catalyzed exchange reactions in chemotherapy.,1) 3-Acetyl pyridine has been found to be quite toxic when administered to mice. Simultaneous administration of nicotinamide or DPN protects against the toxicity of acetyl pyridine. Nicotinic acid and tryptophan do not protect animals from the lethal effects of the compound. 2) Nicotinamide inhibits the formation of the 3-acetyl pyridine analog of DPN from acetyl pyridine and DPN in mouse brain homogenates. Nicotinic acid has no inhibitory effect on analog synthesis. 3) Administration of acetyl pyridine results in a fourfold increase in the DPN level of the lever. No acetyl pyridine analog of DPN is found in the liver after injection of the antimetabolite. 4) Injection of acetyl pyridine into tumor mice results in the formation of the acetyl pyridine analog of DPN in the neoplastic tissues. A decrease in DPN concentration is associated with the analog synthesis. The DPN analog has been isolated from tumor tissue and identified. 5) The results are discussed with respect to the significance of enzymatically catalyzed exchange reactions in chemotherapy.,"KAPLAN, N O;GOLDIN, A;HUMPHREYS, S R;CIOTTI, M M;VENDITTI, J M"
